tafsir[8]{c,v,t}:
  10,26,"<h2>The Reward of the Good-Doers</h2> Allah states that those who do good in this world -- by having faith and performing righteous deeds -- will be rewarded with a good reward in the Hereafter. Allah said:  هَلْ جَزَآءُ الإِحْسَـنِ إِلاَّ الإِحْسَـنُ  (Is there any reward for good other than good)(55:60) Then Allah said:  وَزِيَادَةٌ  (and even more.) the reward on the good deeds multiplied ten times to seven hundred times and even more on top of that. This reward includes what Allah will give them in Paradise, such as the palaces, Al-Hur (virgins of Paradise), and His pleasure upon them. He will give them what He has hidden for them of the delight of the eye. He will grant them on top of all of that and even better, the honor of looking at His Noble Face. This is the increase that is greater than anything that had been given. They will not deserve that because of their deeds, but rather, they will receive it by the grace of Allah and His mercy. The explanation that this refers to looking at Allah's Noble Face was narrated from Abu Bakr, Hudhayfah bin Al-Yaman, `Abdullah bin `Abbas, Sa`id bin Al-Musayyib, `Abdur-Rahman bin Abu Layla, `Abdur-Rahman bin Sabit, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, `Amir bin Sa`ad, `Ata', Ad-Dahhak, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, As-Suddi, Muhammad bin Ishaq, and others from the earlier and later scholars. There are many Hadiths that contain the same interpretation. Among these Hadiths is what Imam Ahmad recorded from Suhayb that Allah's Messenger ﷺ recited this Ayah,  لِّلَّذِينَ أَحْسَنُواْ الْحُسْنَى وَزِيَادَةٌ  (For those who have done good is the best and even more.) And then he said:  «إِذَا دَخَلَ أَهْلُ الْجَنَّةِ الْجَنَّةَ وَأَهْلُ النَّارِ النَّارَ نَادَى مُنَادٍ: يَا أَهْلَ الْجَنَّةِ إِنَّ لَكُمْ عِنْدَ اللهِ مَوْعِدًا يُريدُ أَنْ يُنْجِزَكُمُوهُ فَيَقُولُونَ: وَمَا هُوَ؟ أَلَمْ يُثَقِّلْ مَوَازِينَنَا؟ أَلَمْ يُبَيِّضْ وُجُوهَنَا وَيُدْخِلْنَا الْجَنَّــةَ وَيُجِرْنَا مِنَ النَّارِ؟ قَالَ فَيَكْشِفُ لَهُمُ الْحِجَابَ، فَيَنْظُرُونَ إِلَيهِ، فَوَاللهِ مَا أَعْطَاهُمْ اللهُ شَيْئًا أَحَبَّ إِلَيْهِمْ مِنَ النَّظَرِ إِلَيْهِ، وَلَا أَقَرَّ لِأَعْيُنِهِم»  (When the people of Paradise enter Paradise, a caller will say: `O people of Paradise, Allah has promised you something that He wishes to fulfill.' They will reply: `What is it Has He not made our Scale heavy Has He not made our faces white and delivered us from Fire' Allah will then remove the veil and they will see Him. By Allah, they have not been given anything dearer to them and more delightful than looking at Him.) Muslim and a group of Imams also related this Hadith. Allah then said:  وَلاَ يَرْهَقُ وُجُوهَهُمْ قَتَرٌ  (Neither darkness nor dust shall cover their faces. ..) meaning, no blackness or darkness will be on their faces during the different events of the Day of Judgment. But the faces of the rebellious disbelievers will be stained with dust and darkness.  وَلاَ ذِلَّةٌ  (nor any humiliating disgrace) meaning, they will be covered with degradation and disgrace. The believers, however will not be humiliated internally or externally, on the contrary, they will be protected and honored. For as Allah has said:  فَوَقَـهُمُ اللَّهُ شَرَّ ذَلِكَ الْيَومِ وَلَقَّـهُمْ نَضْرَةً وَسُرُوراً  (So Allah saved them from the evil of that Day, and gave them Nadrah (brightness) and joy.) 76:11 meaning, light in their faces and delight in their hearts. May Allah make us among those by His grace and mercy. "
  10,27,"<h2>The Reward of the Wicked Criminals</h2> After Allah told us about the state of those happy people who have done right and He promised increase in reward, He continued to tell us about the unlucky, miserable ones. He told us about His justice with them. He will reward them with similar evil, without any increase  ﴾وَتَرْهَقُهُمْ﴿ (and will cover them) meaning that their faces will be covered and overtaken by humiliation because of their sins and their fear from these sins. Similarly Allah said:  ﴾وَتَرَاهُمْ يُعْرَضُونَ عَلَيْهَا خَـشِعِينَ مِنَ الذُّلِّ﴿ (And you will see them brought forward to it, (Hell) made humble by disgrace.)42:45 He also said:  ﴾وَلاَ تَحْسَبَنَّ اللَّهَ غَـفِلاً عَمَّا يَعْمَلُ الظَّـلِمُونَ إِنَّمَا يُؤَخِّرُهُمْ لِيَوْمٍ تَشْخَصُ فِيهِ الأَبْصَـرُ مُهْطِعِينَ مُقْنِعِى رُءُوسِهِمْ﴿ (Consider not that Allah is unaware of that which the wrongdoers do, but He gives them respite up to a Day when the eyes will stare in horror. (They will be) hastening forward with necks outstretched, their heads raised up (towards the sky).)14:42 - 43 Allah then said:  ﴾مَّا لَهُمْ مِّنَ اللَّهِ مِنْ عَاصِمٍ﴿ (No defender will they have from Allah.) meaning, there will be no protectors to prevent them from punishment as Allah said:  ﴾يَقُولُ الإِنسَـنُ يَوْمَئِذٍ أَيْنَ الْمَفَرُّ - كَلاَّ لاَ وَزَرَ - إِلَى رَبِّكَ يَوْمَئِذٍ الْمُسْتَقَرُّ ﴿ (On that Day man will say: \"Where (is the refuge) to flee\" No! There is no refuge! Unto your Lord (alone) will be the place of rest that Day.)75:10-12 Allah's statement:  ﴾كَأَنَّمَا أُغْشِيَتْ وُجُوهُهُمْ﴿ (Their faces will be covered as it were...) means that their faces will be dark in the Hereafter. This is similar to His statement:  ﴾يَوْمَ تَبْيَضُّ وُجُوهٌ وَتَسْوَدُّ وُجُوهٌ فَأَمَّا الَّذِينَ اسْوَدَّتْ وُجُوهُهُمْ أَكْفَرْتُمْ بَعْدَ إِيمَـنِكُمْ فَذُوقُواْ الْعَذَابَ بِمَا كُنْتُمْ تَكْفُرُونَ - وَأَمَّا الَّذِينَ ابْيَضَّتْ وُجُوهُهُمْ فَفِى رَحْمَةِ اللَّهِ هُمْ فِيهَا خَـلِدُونَ ﴿ (On the Day (the Day of Resurrection) when some faces will become white and some faces will become black; as for those whose faces will become black (to them will be said): \"Did you reject faith after accepting it Then taste the torment (in Hell) for rejecting faith.\" And for those whose faces will become white, they will be in Allah's mercy (Paradise), therein they shall dwell forever.)3:106-107 He also said:  ﴾وُجُوهٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ مُّسْفِرَةٌ - ضَـحِكَةٌ مُّسْتَبْشِرَةٌ - وَوُجُوهٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ عَلَيْهَا غَبَرَةٌ ﴿ (Some faces that Day will be bright, laughing, rejoicing at good news (of Paradise). And other faces that Day will be dust-stained. )80:38-40  "

  10,30,"<h2>The gods of the Idolators will claim Innocence from them on the Day of Resurrection</h2> Allah said:  ﴾وَيَوْمَ نَحْشُرُهُمْ﴿ (And the Day whereon We shall gather them) Allah will gather together all the creatures of earth, human and Jinn, righteous and rebellious. He said in another Ayah:  ﴾وَحَشَرْنَـهُمْ فَلَمْ نُغَادِرْ مِنْهُمْ أَحَداً﴿ (and We shall gather them all together so as to leave not one of them behind.)18:47  ﴾ثُمَّ نَقُولُ لِلَّذِينَ أَشْرَكُواْ مَكَانَكُمْ أَنتُمْ وَشُرَكَآؤُكُمْ﴿ (then We shall say to those who did associate partners: \"Stop at your place! You and your partners.\") He then will command the idolators to stay where they are and not to move from their destined places so they would be separated from the place of the believers. Similarly, Allah said:  ﴾وَامْتَازُواْ الْيَوْمَ أَيُّهَا الْمُجْرِمُونَ ﴿ ((It will be said): \"And O you the criminals! Get you apart this Day (from the believers).)(36:59) Allah also said:  ﴾وَيَوْمَ تَقُومُ السَّاعَةُ يَوْمَئِذٍ يَتَفَرَّقُونَ ﴿ (And on the Day when the Hour will be established - that Day shall (all men) be separated (the believers will be separated from the disbelievers). )30:14 In the same Surah, Ar-Rum, Allah said:  ﴾يَوْمَئِذٍ يَصَّدَّعُونَ﴿ (On that Day men shall be divided.) 30:43 means, they shall be divided in two. This is what will take place when Allah Almighty will come for Final Judgement. The believers intercede to Allah so the Final Judgement may come and they get rid of that state. The Prophet said,  ﴾«نَحْنُ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ عَلَى كُومٍ فَوْقَ النَّاس»﴿ (On the Day of Resurrection, we will be in a visible place above the other people.) Allah tells us here what He is going to command the idolators and their idols to do on the Day of Resurrection  ﴾مَكَانَكُمْ أَنتُمْ وَشُرَكَآؤُكُمْ فَزَيَّلْنَا بَيْنَهُمْ﴿ (\"Stop at your place! You and your partners.\" Then We shall separate them,) and that they would deny their worship and claim their innocence from them. Similarly, Allah said: `  ﴾كَلاَّ سَيَكْفُرُونَ بِعِبَـدَتِهِمْ﴿ (Nay, but they will deny their worship of them.)19:82,  ﴾إِذْ تَبَرَّأَ الَّذِينَ اتُّبِعُواْ مِنَ الَّذِينَ اتَّبَعُواْ﴿ (When those who were followed declare themselves innocent of those who followed (them).)2:166, and;  ﴾وَمَنْ أَضَلُّ مِمَّن يَدْعُو مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ مَن لاَّ يَسْتَجِيبُ لَهُ إِلَى يَوْمِ الْقِيَـمَةِ وَهُمْ عَن دُعَآئِهِمْ غَـفِلُونَ وَإِذَا حُشِرَ النَّاسُ كَانُواْ لَهُمْ أَعْدَآءً﴿ (And who is more astray than one who calls on (invokes) besides Allah, such as will not answer him till the Day of Resurrection, and who are (even) unaware of their calls (invocations) to them And when mankind are gathered (on the Day of Resurrection), they (false deities) will become their enemies)46:5-6. This refers to the partners responding to those who worshipped them, Then Allah said:  ﴾فَكَفَى بِاللَّهِ شَهِيدًا بَيْنَنَا وَبَيْنَكُمْ﴿ (So sufficient is Allah as a witness between us and you.) They say that we did not know or think that you were worshipping us. Allah is a Witness between us and you that we never called upon you to worship us. We never ordered you to worship us; neither did we accept your worship of us. Allah said:  ﴾هُنَالِكَ تَبْلُواْ كُلُّ نَفْسٍ مَّآ أَسْلَفَتْ﴿ (There! Every person will know (exactly) what he had earned before) This will be the state of accounting on the Day of Resurrection. Every soul shall know all that it had sent forth, both good and evil. Similarly, Allah said:  ﴾يَوْمَ تُبْلَى السَّرَآئِرُ ﴿ (The Day when all the secrets will be examined.)86:9,  ﴾يُنَبَّأُ الإِنسَـنُ يَوْمَئِذِ بِمَا قَدَّمَ وَأَخَّرَ ﴿ (On that Day man will be informed of what he sent forward (of deeds), and what he left behind.)75:13, and  ﴾وَكُلَّ إِنْسَـنٍ أَلْزَمْنَـهُ طَـئِرَهُ فِى عُنُقِهِ وَنُخْرِجُ لَهُ يَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ كِتَابًا يَلْقَـهُ مَنْشُوراً - اقْرَأْ كَتَـبَكَ كَفَى بِنَفْسِكَ الْيَوْمَ عَلَيْكَ حَسِيبًا ﴿ (. ..and on the Day of Resurrection, We shall bring out for him a book which he will find wide open. (It will be said to him): \"Read your book. You yourself are sufficient as a reckoner against you this Day.\") 17:13-14 Then Allah said,  ﴾وَرُدُّواْ إِلَى اللَّهِ مَوْلَـهُمُ الْحَقِّ﴿ (and they will be brought back to Allah, their rightful Mawla.) All affairs and matters will be brought back to Allah, the Judge, the All-Just. He will judge everyone, and then admit the people of Paradise in Paradise and the people of Hell to Hell.  ﴾وَضَلَّ عَنْهُم﴿ (and will vanish from them) meaning what the idolators worshipped,  ﴾مَّا كَانُواْ يَفْتَرُونَ﴿ (what they invented) what they worshipped besides Allah that they invented.

  10,33,"<h2>The Idolators recognize Allah's Tawhid in Lordship and the Evidence is established against Them through this Recognition</h2> Allah argues that the idolators' recognition of Allah's Oneness in Lordship is an evidence against them, for which they should admit and recognize the Oneness in divinity and worship. So Allah said:  ﴾قُلْ مَن يَرْزُقُكُم مِّنَ السَّمَآءِ وَالاٌّرْضِ﴿ (Say: \"Who provides for you from the sky and the earth\") meaning, who is He Who sends down water from the sky and splits the earth with His power and will and allows things to grow from it,  ﴾أَءِلـهٌ مَّعَ اللهِ﴿ (Is there a god, besides Allah) 27:62 Who provides;  ﴾فَأَنبَتْنَا فِيهَا حَبّاً - وَعِنَباً وَقَضْباً - وَزَيْتُوناً وَنَخْلاً - وَحَدَآئِقَ غُلْباً - وَفَـكِهَةً وَأَبّاً ﴿ (Grains. And grapes and clover plants. And olives and date palms. And gardens dense with many trees. And fruits and herbage.)\"80:27-31  ﴾فَسَيَقُولُونَ اللَّهُ﴿ (They will say: \"Allah.\")  ﴾أَمَّنْ هَـذَا الَّذِى يَرْزُقُكُمْ إِنْ أَمْسَكَ رِزْقَهُ﴿ (\"Who is he that can provide for you if He should withhold His provision) 67:21 Allah's statement,  ﴾أَمَّن يَمْلِكُ السَّمْعَ والاٌّبْصَـرَ﴿ (Or who owns hearing and sight) means that Allah is the One who granted you the power of sight and hearing. If He willed otherwise, He would remove these gifts and deprive you of them. Similarly, Allah said:  ﴾قُلْ هُوَ الَّذِى أَنشَأَكُمْ وَجَعَلَ لَكُمُ السَّمْعَ وَالاٌّبْصَـرَ﴿ (Say it is He Who has created you, and endowed you with hearing and seeing.) 67:23 Allah also said:  ﴾قُلْ أَرَأَيْتُمْ إِنْ أَخَذَ اللَّهُ سَمْعَكُمْ وَأَبْصَـرَكُمْ﴿ (Say: \"Tell me, if Allah took away your hearing and your sight.)6:46 Then Allah said:  ﴾وَمَن يُخْرِجُ الْحَىَّ مِنَ الْمَيِّتِ وَيُخْرِجُ الْمَيِّتَ مِنَ الْحَىِّ﴿ (And who brings out the living from the dead and brings out the dead from the living) by His great power and grace.  ﴾وَمَن يُدَبِّرُ الاٌّمْرَ﴿ (And who disposes of the affairs) In Whose Hand is the dominion of everything Who protects all, while against Whom there is no protector Who is the One who judges with none reversing His judgement Who is the One that is not questioned about what He does while they will be questioned  ﴾يَسْأَلُهُ مَن فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ كُلَّ يَوْمٍ هُوَ فِى شَأْنٍ ﴿ (Whosoever is in the heavens and on earth begs of Him. Every day He is (engaged) in some affair!)55:29 The upper and lower kingdoms and what is in them both, including the angels, humans, and Jinn are in desperate need of Him. They are His servants and are under His control.  ﴾فَسَيَقُولُونَ اللَّهُ﴿ (They will say: \"Allah.\") they say this knowingly and they admit it.  ﴾فَقُلْ أَفَلاَ تَتَّقُونَ﴿ (Say: `Will you not then be afraid (of Allah's punishment)\") meaning, don't you fear Him when you worship others because of your ignorance and false opinions Allah then said:  ﴾فَذَلِكُمُ اللَّهُ رَبُّكُمُ الْحَقُّ﴿ (Such is Allah, your Lord in truth.) This Lord that you admitted is the One Who does all this, is your Lord and the True Deity that deserves to be worshipped alone.  ﴾فَمَاذَا بَعْدَ الْحَقِّ إِلاَّ الضَّلاَلُ﴿ (So after the truth, what else can there be, save error) any one worshipped other than Him is false, for there is no God but Allah, He Has no partners.  ﴾فَأَنَّى تُصْرَفُونَ﴿ (How then are you turned away) How then can you turn away from His worship to worship others while you know that He is the Lord that has created everything, the One who controls and governs everything Allah then said:  ﴾كَذَلِكَ حَقَّتْ كَلِمَةُ رَبِّكَ عَلَى الَّذِينَ فَسَقُواْ﴿ (Thus is the Word of your Lord justified against those who rebel,) These idolators disbelieved and continued to practice their Shirk, and worship others beside Allah. But they knew that He is the Creator, the Sustainer and the only One of authority and control in this universe, the One Who sent His Messengers to single Him out for all worship. As they disbelieved and were persistent in their Shirk, Allah's Word proved true and was justified that they would be miserable inhabitants of the Fire. Allah said:  ﴾قَالُواْ بَلَى وَلَـكِنْ حَقَّتْ كَلِمَةُ الْعَذَابِ عَلَى الْكَـفِرِينَ﴿ (They will say: \"Yes,\" but the Word of torment has been justified against the disbelievers!) 39:71  "
