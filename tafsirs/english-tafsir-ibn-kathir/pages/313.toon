  20,16,"<h2>The First Revelation to Musa</h2> Allah, the Exalted, says,  فَلَمَّآ أَتَاهَا  (And when he came to it,) This is referring to the fire when he approached it.  نُودِىَ يمُوسَى  (He was called by name: \"O Musa!\") In another Ayah it says,  نُودِىَ مِن شَاطِىءِ الْوَادِى الأَيْمَنِ فِى الْبُقْعَةِ الْمُبَارَكَةِ مِنَ الشَّجَرَةِ أَن يمُوسَى إِنِّى أَنَا اللَّهُ  (He was called from the right side of the valley, in the blessed place, from the tree: \"O Musa! Verily, I am Allah.\")28:30 However, here Allah says,  إِنِّى أَنَاْ رَبُّكَ  (Verily, I am your Lord!) meaning, `the One Who is talking to you and addressing you,'  فَاخْلَعْ نَعْلَيْكَ  (So take off your shoes;) `Ali bin Abi Talib, Abu Dharr, Abu Ayyub and others of the Salaf said, \"They (his sandals) were from the skin of a donkey that was not slaughtered.\" It has also been said that he was only commanded to remove his sandals due to respect for the blessed spot. Concerning Allah's statement,  طُوًى  (Tuwa) `Ali bin Abi Talhah said that Ibn `Abbas said, \"It is the name of the valley.\" Others have said the same. This is merely mentioned as something to give more explanation to the story. It has also been said that it is a figure of speech, which comes from the command to place his feet down. It has also been said that it means `doubly sacred' and that Tuwa is something that has repetitious blessings. However, the first opinion is most correct. It is similar to Allah's statement,  إِذْ نَادَاهُ رَبُّهُ بِالْوَادِ الْمُقَدَّسِ طُوًى  (When his Lord called him in the sacred valley of Tuwa.) 79:16 Allah's statement,  وَأَنَا اخْتَرْتُكَ  (And I have chosen you.) is similar to His statement,  إِنْى اصْطَفَيْتُكَ عَلَى النَّاسِ بِرِسَـلَـتِي وَبِكَلَـمِي  (I have chosen you above men by My Messages, and by My speaking (to you).) 7:144 This means over all human beings of that time. It has also been said that Allah said, \"O Musa, do you know why I chose to speak to you directly out of all of the people\" Musa said, \"No.\" Allah then said, \"Because I have not made anyone humble himself as much as you have humbled yourself. \" Concerning Allah's statement,  فَاسْتَمِعْ لِمَا يُوحَى  (So listen to that which will be revealed.) \"Now listen to what I say to you and what I reveal to you.\"  إِنَّنِى أَنَا اللَّهُ لا إِلَـهَ إِلا أَنَاْ  (Verily, I am Allah! There is no God but Me,) This is the first obligation upon all responsible people of age, that they know that there is no God worthy of worship except Allah alone, Who has no partners. Concerning Allah's statement,  فَاعْبُدْنِى  (so worship Me,) This means, \"Single Me out alone for worship, and establish My worship without associating anything with Me.\"  وَأَقِمِ الصَّلَوةَ لِذِكْرِى  (and perform Salah for My remembrance.) It has been said that this means, \"Pray in order to remember Me.\" It has also been said that it means, \"And establish the prayer whenever you remember Me.\" There is a supporting evidence for this second statement in a Hadith recorded by Imam Ahmad from Anas, who said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,  «إِذَا رَقَدَ أَحَدُكُمْ عَنِ الصَّلَاةِ أَوْ غَفَلَ عَنْهَا، فَلْيُصَلِّهَا إِذَا ذَكَرَهَا، فَإِنَّ اللهَ تَعَالى قَالَ:  وَأَقِمِ الصَّلَوةَ لِذِكْرِى  (Whenever one of you sleeps past the prayer, or he forgets to pray, then let him pray when he remembers it. For verily, Allah said, (And perform Salah for My remembrance.)) In the Two Sahihs it is reported from Anas that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,  «مَنْ نَامَ عَنْ صَلَاةٍ أَوْ نَسِيَهَا فَكَفَّارَتُهَا أَنْ يُصَلِّيَهَا إِذَا ذَكَرَهَا، لَا كَفَّارَةَةَلهَا إِلَّا ذَلِك»  (Whoever slept past the prayer, or forgot it, then his expiation is that he prays it when he remembers it. There is no expiation for it other than that.) Concerning Allah's statement,  إِنَّ السَّاعَةَ ءَاتِيَةٌ  (Verily, the Hour is coming) This means that it is established and there is no avoiding it. It will be and it is inevitable. Concerning Allah's statement,  أَكَادُ أُخْفِيهَا  (I am almost hiding it) Ad-Dahhak related from Ibn `Abbas that he used to recite it as, \"I almost kept it hidden -- from myself.\" Ibn `Abbas then would say, \"Because nothing is ever hidden from Allah's Self.\" `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas that he said,  أَكَادُ أُخْفِيهَا  (I am almost hiding it.) \"This means that no one knows its appointed time except Me (Allah).\" Allah also said,  ثَقُلَتْ فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ لاَ تَأْتِيكُمْ إِلاَّ بَغْتَةً  (Heavy is its burden through the heavens and the earth. It shall not come upon you except all of a sudden.) 7:187 This means that its knowledge weighs heavily upon the dwellers of the heavens and the earth. Concerning Allah's statement,  لِتُجْزَى كُلُّ نَفْسٍ بِمَا تَسْعَى  (that every person may be rewarded for that which he strives.) \"I will establish it and it is inevitable. I will certainly reward every person who does something, according to what he did.\"  فَمَن يَعْمَلْ مِثْقَالَ ذَرَّةٍ خَيْراً يَرَهُ - وَمَن يَعْـمَلْ مِثْقَالَ ذَرَّةٍ شَرّاً يَرَهُ  (So whosoever does good equal to the weight of an atom shall see it. And whosoever does evil equal to the weight of an atom shall see it.) 99:7-8  إِنَّمَا تُجْزَوْنَ مَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ  (You are only being requited for what you used to do.) 52:16 Allah said,  فَلاَ يَصُدَّنَّكَ عَنْهَا مَن لاَّ يُؤْمِنُ بِهَا  (Therefore, let not divert you the one who believes not therein,) The address here is directed towards all individuals who are responsible (and capable of taking heed to this message). This means, \"Do not follow the way of the person who does not believe in the Hour (Day of Judgement) and he only pursues his desires in this worldly life. He disobeys his Lord and only follows his desires. Whoever behaves like these people, then verily he has failed and lost.  فَتَرْدَى  (lest you perish.) This means that you will be destroyed and ruined.  وَمَا يُغْنِى عَنْهُ مَالُهُ إِذَا تَرَدَّى  (And what will his wealth avail him when he goes down (in destruction)) 92:11  وَمَا تِلْكَ بِيَمِينِكَ يمُوسَى - قَالَ هِىَ عَصَاىَ أَتَوَكَّؤُا عَلَيْهَا وَأَهُشُّ بِهَا عَلَى غَنَمِى وَلِىَ فِيهَا مَأَرِبُ أُخْرَى "

  20,21,"<h2>The Stick of Musa turned into a Snake</h2> This was a proof from Allah for Musa and a great miracle. This was something that broke through the boundaries of what is considered normal, thus, it was a brilliant evidence that none but Allah could do. It was also a proof that no one could come with the likes of this (from mankind) except a Prophet who was sent (by Allah). Concerning Allah's statement,  ﴾وَمَا تِلْكَ بِيَمِينِكَ يمُوسَى ﴿ (And what is that in your right hand, O Musa) Some of the scholars of Tafsir have said, \"He (Allah) only said this to him in order to draw his attention to it.\" It has also been said, \"He only said this to him in order to affirm for him what was in his hand. In other words, that which is in your right hand is a stick that you are familiar with. You will see what We are about to do to it now.\"  ﴾وَمَا تِلْكَ بِيَمِينِكَ يمُوسَى ﴿ (And what is that in your right hand, O Musa) This is an interrogative phrase for the purpose of affirmation.  ﴾قَالَ هِىَ عَصَاىَ أَتَوَكَّؤُا عَلَيْهَا﴿ (He said: \"This is my stick, whereon I lean...\") I lean on it while I am walking.  ﴾وَأَهُشُّ بِهَا عَلَى غَنَمِى﴿ (and wherewith I beat down branches for my sheep,) This means, `I use it to shake the branches of trees so that the leaves will fall for my sheep to eat them. ' `Abdur-Rahman bin Al-Qasim reported from Imam Malik that he said, \"It is when a man places his staff into a branch and shakes it so that its leaves and fruit will fall without breaking the stick. It is not the same as striking or beating.\" Maymun bin Mahran also said the same. Concerning his statement,  ﴾وَلِىَ فِيهَا مَأَرِبُ أُخْرَى﴿ (and wherein I find other uses.) This means other benefits, services and needs besides this. Some of the scholars took upon themselves the burden of mentioning many of these obscure uses. Concerning Allah's statement,  ﴾قَالَ أَلْقِهَا يمُوسَى ﴿ ((Allah) said: \"Cast it down, O Musa!\") \"Throw down this stick that is in your right hand, O Musa.\"  ﴾فَأَلْقَـهَا فَإِذَا هِىَ حَيَّةٌ تَسْعَى ﴿ (He cast it down, and behold! It was a snake, moving quickly.) This means that the stick changed into a huge snake, like a long python, and it moved with rapid movements. It moved as if it were the fastest type of small snake. Yet, it was in the form of the largest snake, while still having the fastest of movements.  ﴾تَسْعَى﴿ (moving quickly.) moving restlessly. Concerning Allah's statement,  ﴾سَنُعِيدُهَا سِيَرتَهَا الاٍّولَى﴿ (We shall return it to its former state. ) the form that it was in, as you recognized it before.  "

  20,35,"<h2>The Hand of Musa turning White without any Disease</h2> This is the second sign of Musa. That is Allah has commanded him to place his hand into the opening of his garment, as is clearly stated in another Ayah. It mentioned here merely as a passing reference, saying:  ﴾وَاضْمُمْ يَدَكَ إِلَى جَنَاحِكَ﴿ (And press your hand to your side:) Allah said in another Ayah,  ﴾وَاضْمُمْ إِلَيْكَ جَنَاحَكَ مِنَ الرَّهْبِ فَذَانِكَ بُرْهَانَـنِ مِن رَّبِّكَ إِلَى فِرْعَوْنَ وَمَلَئِهِ﴿ (And draw your hand close to your side to be free from fear. These are two signs from your Lord to Fir`awn and his chiefs.) 28:32 Mujahid said,  ﴾وَاضْمُمْ يَدَكَ إِلَى جَنَاحِكَ﴿ (And press your hand to your side:) \"This means put your palm under your upper arm.\" When Musa put his hand into the opening of his garment and brought it out, it came out shining as if it were a half moon. Concerning His statement,  ﴾تَخْرُجْ بَيْضَآءَ مِنْ غَيْرِ سُوءٍ﴿ (it will come forth white, without any disease) This means without any leprosy, ailment, or disfigurement. This was stated by Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak, As-Suddi and others. Al-Hasan Al-Basri said, \"He brought it out, and by Allah, it was as if it were a lamp. From this Musa knew that he had surely met his Lord, the Mighty and Sublime.\" This is why Allah says,  ﴾لِنُرِيَكَ مِنْ ءَايَـتِنَا الْكُبْرَى ﴿ (That We may show you (some) of Our greater signs.)  <h2>Allah commanded Musa to go to Fir`awn to convey the Message Allah said,</h2>Allah commanded Musa to go to Fir`awn to convey the Message Allah said,﴾اذْهَبْ إِلَى فِرْعَوْنَ إِنَّهُ طَغَى ﴿ (Go to Fir`awn! Verily, he has transgressed.) This means, \"Go to Fir`awn, the king of Egypt, whom you left Egypt fleeing from, and invite him to the worship of Allah alone, Who has no partners. Command him to treat the Children of Israel well and to not torment them. For verily, he has transgressed, oppressed, preferred the worldly life and forgotten the Most High Lord.\"  <h2>The Supplication of Musa</h2>﴾قَالَ رَبِّ اشْرَحْ لِى صَدْرِى - وَيَسِّرْ لِى أَمْرِى ﴿ ((Musa) said: \"O my Lord! Open for me my chest, and ease my task for me.\") Musa requsted his Lord to expand his chest for his mission. For verily, He was commanding him with a great task and a weighty affair. He was sending him to the mightiest king on the face of the earth at that time. He was the most arrogant and severe of all people in his disbelief, and He had the largest army and the most powerful kingdom. He was the most tyrannical and the most obstinate of rulers. His case was such that he claimed not to know Allah at all, and that he knew of no god for his subjects other than himself. Along with this, Musa lived in his home for a period of time as a child. He stayed in Fir`awn's own room and slept on his bed. Then, after this, he killed one of their people and feared that they would retaliate by killing him in return. Thus, he fled from them and remained an outlaw during this entire time. Then, after all of this, His Lord sent him to them as a warner calling them to worship Allah alone, without associating partners with Him. This is why he said,  ﴾قَالَ رَبِّ اشْرَحْ لِى صَدْرِى - وَيَسِّرْ لِى أَمْرِى ﴿ (O my Lord! Open for me my chest, and ease my task for me.) This means, \"I cannot perform this task if You do not help me, aid me and support me.\"  ﴾وَاحْلُلْ عُقْدَةً مِّن لِّسَانِى - يَفْقَهُواْ قَوْلِي ﴿ (And loosen the knot from my tongue, that they understand my speech.) This is referring to the lisp that he had. This lisp was a result of an incident when he was presented a date and a hot coal stone and he placed the coal on his tongue instead of the date. A detailed explanation of this story is forthcoming in the following chapters. However, he did not ask Allah to remove this affliction all together. Rather, he asked for removal of his stammering so the people would understand what he intended in his speech. He was only asking for what was necessary to deliver his message. If he had asked for the removal of his affliction in its entirety, it would have been cured for him. However, the Prophets do not ask for any more than what is required. Therefore, he was left with the remnants of this accident that took place with his tongue. Allah informed of what Fir`awn said concerning him,  ﴾أَمْ أَنَآ خَيْرٌ مِّنْ هَـذَا الَّذِى هُوَ مَهِينٌ وَلاَ يَكَادُ يُبِينُ ﴿ (Am I not better than this one who is despicable and can scarcely express himself clearly)43:52 This means that he is not eloquent in speech. Concerning Allah's statement,  ﴾وَاجْعَل لِّى وَزِيراً مِّنْ أَهْلِى - هَـرُونَ أَخِى ﴿ (And appoint for me a helper from my family, Harun, my brother.) This was also a request from Musa concerning something not pertaining to himself. That was his request for the assistance of his brother, Harun. Ath-Thawri reported from Abu Sa`id, from `Ikrimah, who said that Ibn `Abbas said, \"Harun was made a Prophet at the same moment that Musa was made a Prophet.\" Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `A'ishah went out intending to perform `Umrah and stopped to camp among some bedouins. While she was among them she heard a man say, \"Which brother in this life was the most beneficial to his brother\" The people said, \"We do not know.\" The man said, \"By Allah, I know.\" `A'ishah said, \"I said to myself about his swearing, that he should not swear such an oath, singling himself out as knowing what person was of most benefit to his brother.\" The man said, \"It is Musa, when he asked for prophethood to be bestowed upon his brother.\" Then `A'ishah said, \"By Allah, he has spoken truthfully.\" This is why Allah commended Musa by saying,  ﴾وَكَانَ عِندَ اللَّهِ وَجِيهاً﴿ (And he was honorable before Allah.)33:69 Concerning Musa's statement,  ﴾اشْدُدْ بِهِ أَزْرِى ﴿ (Increase my strength with him.) Mujahid said, \"This means to make my back strong.\"  ﴾وَأَشْرِكْهُ فِى أَمْرِى ﴿ (And let him share my task.) make him my consultant in this matter.  ﴾كَىْ نُسَبِّحَكَ كَثِيراً - وَنَذْكُرَكَ كَثِيراً ﴿ (That we may glorify You much, and remember You much.) Mujahid said, \"A servant of Allah is not considered of those who remember Allah much until he remembers Allah while standing, sitting and lying down.\" Concerning his statement,  ﴾إِنَّكَ كُنتَ بِنَا بَصِيراً ﴿ (Verily, You are ever seeing us.) This means in Your choosing us, giving us the prophethood and sending us to Your enemy, Fir`awn. So unto You is all praise for this.  "
