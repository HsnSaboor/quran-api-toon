  41,48,"<h2>Everyone will be requited according to His Deeds</h2> مَّنْ عَمِلَ صَـلِحاً فَلِنَفْسِهِ  (Whosoever does righteous good deed, it is for himself;) means, the benefit of which will come to him.  وَمَنْ أَسَآءَ فَعَلَيْهَا  (and whosoever does evil, it is against himself.) means, the consequences of that will come back on him.  وَمَا رَبُّكَ بِظَلَّـمٍ لِّلْعَبِيدِ  (And your Lord is not at all unjust to (His) servants) means, He only punishes people for their sins, and He does not punish anyone except after establishing proof against him and sending a Messenger to him. <h2>Knowledge of the Hour is with Allah Alone</h2> Then Allah says:  إِلَيْهِ يُرَدُّ عِلْمُ السَّاعَةِ  (To Him is referred the knowledge of the Hour.) meaning, no one knows about that apart from Him. Muhammad ﷺ, the leader of mankind, said to Jibril, who is one of the leading angels, when he asked him about the Hour:  «مَا الْمَسْؤُولُ عَنْهَا بِأَعْلَمَ مِنَ السَّائِل»  (The one who is asked about it does not know more than the one who is asking.)\" And Allah says:  إِلَى رَبِّكَ مُنتَهَـهَآ  (To your Lord belongs the term thereof.) (79:44)  لاَ يُجَلِّيهَا لِوَقْتِهَآ إِلاَّ هُوَ  (None can reveal its time but He) (7:187).  وَمَا تَخْرُجُ مِن ثَمَرَتٍ مِّنْ أَكْمَامِهَا وَمَا تَحْمِلُ مِنْ أُنْثَى وَلاَ تَضَعُ إِلاَّ بِعِلْمِهِ  (No fruit comes out of its sheath, nor does a female conceive nor brings forth (young), except by His knowledge.) means, all of that is known to Him, and nothing is hidden from your Lord the weight of a speck of dust on the earth or in the heaven. Allah says:  وَمَا تَسْقُطُ مِن وَرَقَةٍ إِلاَّ يَعْلَمُهَا  (not a leaf falls, but He knows it) (6:59).  يَعْلَمُ مَا تَحْمِلُ كُلُّ أُنثَى وَمَا تَغِيضُ الاٌّرْحَامُ وَمَا تَزْدَادُ وَكُلُّ شَىْءٍ عِندَهُ بِمِقْدَارٍ  (Allah knows what every female bears, and by how much the wombs fall short or exceed. Everything with Him is in (due) proportion) (13:8).  وَمَا يُعَمَّرُ مِن مُّعَمَّرٍ وَلاَ يُنقَصُ مِنْ عُمُرِهِ إِلاَّ فِى كِتَـبٍ إِنَّ ذَلِكَ عَلَى اللَّهِ يَسِيرٌ  (And no aged man is granted a length of life nor is a part cut off from his life, but is in a Book. Surely, that is easy for Allah.) (35:11)  وَيَوْمَ يُنَادِيهِمْ أَيْنَ شُرَكَآئِى  (And on the Day when He will call unto them (saying): \"Where are My (so-called) partners\") means, on the Day of Resurrection, Allah will call out to the idolators before all of creation and say, \"Where are My partners whom you worshipped besides Me\"  قَالُواْ ءَاذَنَّاكَ  (They will say: \"We inform You...\") means, `we tell You,'  مَا مِنَّا مِن شَهِيدٍ  (that none of us bears witness to it.) means, `not one of us will bear witness today that You have any partner.'  وَضَلَّ عَنْهُم مَّا كَانُواْ يَدْعُونَ مِن قَبْلُ  (And those whom they used to invoke before (in this world) shall disappear from them, ) means, they will go away, and will be of no benefit to them.  وَظَنُّواْ مَا لَهُمْ مِّن مَّحِيصٍ  (and they will perceive that they have no place of refuge) means, they will have no way of escaping from the punishment of Allah. This is like the Ayah:  وَرَأَى الْمُجْرِمُونَ النَّارَ فَظَنُّواْ أَنَّهُمْ مُّوَاقِعُوهَا وَلَمْ يَجِدُواْ عَنْهَا مَصْرِفًا  (And the criminals shall see the Fire and apprehend that they have to fall therein. And they will find no way of escape from there.) (18:53) "

  41,51,"<h2>Man is fickle when Ease comes to Him after Difficulty</h2> Allah tells us that man never gets bored of asking his Lord for good things, such as wealth, physical health, etc., but if evil touches him -- i.e., trials and difficulties or poverty -- ﴾فَيَئُوسٌ قَنُوطٌ﴿ (then he gives up all hope and is lost in despair.), i.e., he thinks that he will never experience anything good again. ﴾وَلَئِنْ أَذَقْنَـهُ رَحْمَةً مِّنَّا مِن بَعْدِ ضَرَّآءَ مَسَّتْهُ لَيَقُولَنَّ هَـذَا لِى﴿ (And truly, if We give him a taste of mercy from Us, after some adversity has touched him, he is sure to say: \"This is due to my (merit)...\") means, if something good happens to him or some provision comes to him after a period of difficulty, he says, `this is because of me, because I deserve this from my Lord.' ﴾وَمَآ أَظُنُّ السَّاعَةَ قَائِمَةً﴿ (I think not that the Hour will be established.) means, he does not believe that the Hour will come. So when he is given some blessing, he becomes careless, arrogant and ungrateful, as Allah says: ﴾كَلاَّ إِنَّ الإِنسَـنَ لَيَطْغَى - أَن رَّءَاهُ اسْتَغْنَى ﴿ (Nay! Verily, man does transgress. Because he considers himself self-sufficient.) (96:6) ﴾وَلَئِن رُّجِّعْتُ إِلَى رَبِّى إِنَّ لِى عِندَهُ لَلْحُسْنَى﴿ (But if I am brought back to my Lord, surely there will be for me the best with Him.) means, `if there is a Hereafter after all, then my Lord will be generous and kind to me just as He was in this world.' So he expects Allah to do him favors in spite of his bad deeds and lack of certain faith. Allah says: ﴾فَلَنُنَبِّئَنَّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ بِمَا عَمِلُواْ وَلَنُذِيقَنَّهُمْ مِّنْ عَذَابٍ غَلِيظٍ﴿ (Then, We verily will show to the disbelievers what they have done, and We shall make them taste a severe torment.) Thus Allah threatens punishment and vengeance to those whose conduct and belief is like that. ﴾وَإِذَآ أَنْعَمْنَا عَلَى الإنْسَـنِ أَعْرَضَ وَنَأَى بِجَانِبِهِ﴿ (And when We show favor to man, he turns away and becomes arrogant;) means, he turns away from doing acts of obedience and is too proud to obey the commands of Allah. This is like the Ayah: ﴾فَتَوَلَّى بِرُكْنِهِ﴿ (But Fir`awn turned away along with his hosts) (51:39). ﴾وَإِذَا مَسَّهُ الشَّرُّ﴿ (but when evil touches him,) means, difficulties, ﴾فَذُو دُعَآءٍ عَرِيضٍ﴿ (then he has recourse to long supplications.) means, he asks at length for one thing. Long supplications are those which are long on words and short on meaning. The opposite is concise speech which is brief but full of meaning. And Allah says: ﴾وَإِذَا مَسَّ الإِنسَـنَ الضُّرُّ دَعَانَا لِجَنبِهِ أَوْ قَاعِدًا أَوْ قَآئِمًا فَلَمَّا كَشَفْنَا عَنْهُ ضُرَّهُ مَرَّ كَأَن لَّمْ يَدْعُنَآ إِلَى ضُرٍّ مَّسَّهُ﴿ (And when harm touches man, he invokes Us, lying on his side, or sitting or standing. But when We have removed his harm from him, he passes on as if he had never invoked Us for a harm that touched him!) (10:12) "

  41,54,"<h2>The Qur'an and the Proofs of its Truth Allah says:</h2> قُلْ  (Say) -- `O Muhammad, to these idolators who disbelieve in the Qur'an'--  أَرَءَيْتُمْ إِن كَانَ  (Tell me, if it) -- this Qur'an --  مِنْ عِندِ اللَّهِ ثُمَّ كَفَرْتُمْ بِهِ  (is from Allah, and you disbelieve in it) means, `what do you think your position is before the One Who revealed it to His Messenger' Allah says:  مَنْ أَضَلُّ مِمَّنْ هُوَ فِى شِقَاقٍ بَعِيدٍ  (Who is more astray than one who is in opposition far away.) means, he is in a state of disbelief, stubbornness and opposition to the truth, and is following a path that leads far away from guidance. Then Allah says:  سَنُرِيهِمْ ءَايَـتِنَا فِى الاٌّفَاقِ وَفِى أَنفُسِهِمْ  (We will show them Our signs in the universe, and within themselves,) meaning, `We will show them Our evidence and proof that the Qur'an is true and has indeed been sent down from Allah to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, through external signs,  فِى الاٌّفَاقِ  (in the universe), ' such as conquests and the advent of Islam over various regions and over all other religions. Mujahid, Al-Hasan and As-Suddi said, \"And signs within themselves means, the battle of Badr, the conquest of Makkah, and other events which befell them, where Allah granted victory to Muhammad  ﷺand his Companions, and inflicted a humiliating defeat on falsehood and its followers.\" It may also be that what is meant here is man and his physical composition. As detailed in the science of anatomy, which indicates the wisdom of the Creator -- may He be blessed and exalted -- and the different inclinations and opposite natures that people have, good and bad, etc., and the (divine) decrees to which man is subjected, having no power to change and over which he has no control.  حَتَّى يَتَبَيَّنَ لَهُمْ أَنَّهُ الْحَقُّ أَوَلَمْ يَكْفِ بِرَبِّكَ أَنَّهُ عَلَى كُلِّ شَىْءٍ شَهِيدٌ  (until it becomes manifest to them that this (the Qur'an) is the truth. Is it not sufficient in regard to your Lord that He is a Witness over all things) means, sufficient is Allah as a Witness over the words and deeds of His servants, and He bears witness that Muhammad ﷺ is telling the truth in what he says, as Allah says:  لَّـكِنِ اللَّهُ يَشْهَدُ بِمَآ أَنزَلَ إِلَيْكَ أَنزَلَهُ بِعِلْمِهِ  (But Allah bears witness to that which He has sent down unto you; He has sent it down with His knowledge) (4:166).  أَلاَ إِنَّهُمْ فِى مِرْيَةٍ مِّن لِّقَآءِ رَبِّهِمْ  (Lo, Verily, they are in doubt concerning the meeting with their Lord.) means, they doubt that the Hour will come, they do not think about it or strive for it or pay heed to it; on the contrary, they regard it as irrelevant and do not care about it. But it will undoubtedly come to pass. Then Allah states that He is Able to do all things and He encompasses all things, and it is very easy for Him to bring about the Hour:  أَلاَ إِنَّهُ بِكُلِّ شَىْءٍ مُّحِيطُ  (Verily, He is surrounding all things!) means, all of creation is subject to His control, dominion and knowledge; He is controlling all things by His power, so whatever He wills happens, and whatever He does not will does not happen, and there is no god worthy of worship apart from Him. This is the end of the Tafsir of Surah Fussilat. To Allah be praise and blessings. "
