  6,30,"<h2>Wishes and Hopes Do Not Help One When He Sees the Torment</h2> Allah mentions the condition of the disbelievers when they are made to stand before the Fire on the Day of Resurrection and witness its chains and restraints, along with seeing the horrible, momentous conditions in the Fire with their own eyes. This is when the disbelievers will say,  ﴾يلَيْتَنَا نُرَدُّ وَلاَ نُكَذِّبَ بِـَايَـتِ رَبِّنَا وَنَكُونَ مِنَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ﴿ (\"Would that we were but sent back (to the world)! Then we would not deny the Ayat of our Lord, and we would be of the believers!\") They wish that they would be sent back to the life of the world so that they could perform righteous deeds, refrain from disbelieving in the Ayat of their Lord and be among the believers. Allah said,  ﴾بَلْ بَدَا لَهُمْ مَّا كَانُواْ يُخْفُونَ مِن قَبْلُ﴿ (Nay, what they had been concealing before has become manifest to them.) meaning, the disbelief, denial and rebellion that they used to hide in their hearts will then be uncovered, even though they will try to hide this fact in this life and the Hereafter. Earlier, Allah said,  ﴾ثُمَّ لَمْ تَكُنْ فِتْنَتُهُمْ إِلاَّ أَن قَالُواْ وَاللَّهِ رَبِّنَا مَا كُنَّا مُشْرِكِينَ - انظُرْ كَيْفَ كَذَبُواْ عَلَى أَنفُسِهِمْ وَضَلَّ عَنْهُمْ مَّا كَانُواْ يَفْتَرُونَ ﴿ (There will then be (left) no trial for them but to say: \"By Allah, our Lord, we were not those who joined others in worship with Allah.\" Look! How they lie against themselves! But the (lie) which they invented will disappear from them. ) It is also possible that the meaning here is that the disbelievers will realize the truth that they knew all along in their hearts, that is, that what the Messengers brought them in this life is true, although they used to deny his Message before their followers. Allah said that Musa said to Fir`awn,  ﴾لَقَدْ عَلِمْتَ مَآ أَنزَلَ هَـؤُلاءِ إِلاَّ رَبُّ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ بَصَآئِرَ﴿ (\"Verily, you know that these signs have clearly been sent down by none but the Lord of the heavens and the earth as eye-opening evidence.\") 17:102 Allah said about Fir`awn and his people,  ﴾وَجَحَدُواْ بِهَا وَاسْتَيْقَنَتْهَآ أَنفُسُهُمْ ظُلْماً وَعُلُوّاً﴿ (And they belied them (those Ayat) wrongfully and arrogantly, though they were themselves convinced thereof.) 27:14  ﴾بَلْ بَدَا لَهُمْ مَّا كَانُواْ يُخْفُونَ مِن قَبْلُ﴿ (Nay, it has become manifest to them what they had been concealing before.) 6:28 When this occurs, and the disbelievers ask to be returned to this life, they will not do so because they truly wish to embrace the faith. Rather, they ask to be returned to this life for fear of the torment that they are witnessing before them, as punishment for the disbelief they committed, and to try and avoid the Fire that they see before their eyes.  ﴾وَلَوْ رُدُّواْ لَعَـدُواْ لِمَا نُهُواْ عَنْهُ وَإِنَّهُمْ لَكَـذِبُونَ﴿ (But if they were returned, they would certainly revert to that which they were forbidden. And indeed they are liars.) meaning, they lie when they say they wish to go back to this life so that they can embrace the faith. Allah states that even if they were sent back to the life of this world, they will again commit the disbelief and defiance that they were prohibited.  ﴾وَإِنَّهُمْ لَكَـذِبُونَ﴿ (And indeed they are liars.) in their statement that,  ﴾وَلَوْ تَرَى إِذْ وُقِفُواْ عَلَى النَّارِ فَقَالُواْ يلَيْتَنَا نُرَدُّ وَلاَ نُكَذِّبَ بِـَايَـتِ رَبِّنَا وَنَكُونَ مِنَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ - بَلْ بَدَا لَهُمْ مَّا كَانُواْ يُخْفُونَ مِن قَبْلُ وَلَوْ رُدُّواْ لَعَـدُواْ لِمَا نُهُواْ عَنْهُ وَإِنَّهُمْ لَكَـذِبُونَ - وَقَالُواْ إِنْ هِىَ إِلاَّ حَيَاتُنَا الدُّنْيَا وَمَا نَحْنُ بِمَبْعُوثِينَ ﴿ (\"Would that we were but sent back! Then we would not deny the Ayat of our Lord, and we would be of the believers!\" Nay, what they had been concealing before has become manifest to them. But if they were returned, they would certainly revert to that which they were forbidden. And indeed they are liars. And they said: \"There is no (other life) but our (present) life of this world, and never shall we be resurrected.\") Therefore, they will revert to their old behavior and say,  ﴾إِنْ هِىَ إِلاَّ حَيَاتُنَا الدُّنْيَا﴿ (There is no life but our life of this world) and there is no Hereafter,  ﴾وَمَا نَحْنُ بِمَبْعُوثِينَ﴿ (and never shall we be resurrected. ) Allah said,  ﴾وَلَوْ تَرَى إِذْ وُقِفُواْ عَلَى رَبِّهِمْ﴿ (If you could but see when they will stand before their Lord!) in front of Him,  ﴾أَلَيْسَ هَـذَا بِالْحَقِّ﴿ (\"Is not this the truth\") meaning, is not Resurrection true, contarary to what you thought,  ﴾قَالُواْ بَلَى وَرَبِّنَا قَالَ فَذُوقُواْ العَذَابَ بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَكْفُرُونَ﴿ (They will say: \"Yes, by our Lord!\" He will then say: \"So taste you the torment because you used not to believe.\") and because you today denied Resurrection. Therefore, taste the torment,  ﴾أَفَسِحْرٌ هَـذَا أَمْ أَنتُمْ لاَ تُبْصِرُونَ ﴿ (\"Is this magic, or do you not see\") 52:15  "

  6,32,"<h2>Allah describes the regret of the disbelievers when facing Him, and their disappointment at the commencement, along with theirsorrow for not performing good deeds and for their evil deeds</h2> This is why Allah said,  ﴾حَتَّى إِذَا جَآءَتْهُمُ السَّاعَةُ بَغْتَةً قَالُواْ يحَسْرَتَنَا عَلَى مَا فَرَّطْنَا فِيهَا﴿ (until all of a sudden, the Hour (signs of death) is upon them, and they say: \"Alas for us that we gave no thought to it.\") `It' here refers to either the life of this world, or the affairs of the Hereafter. Allah's statement,  ﴾وَهُمْ يَحْمِلُونَ أَوْزَارَهُمْ عَلَى ظُهُورِهِمْ أَلاَ سَآءَ مَا يَزِرُونَ﴿ (while they will bear their burdens on their backs; and evil indeed are the burdens that they will bear!) Asbat said that As-Suddi said, \"Upon entering his grave, every unjust person will meet a man with an ugly face, dark skin, awful odor, wearing dirty clothes, who will enter his grave with him. When the unjust person sees him, he will say, `How ugly is your face!' He will reply, `So was your work, it was ugly.' The unjust person will say, `How foul is the odor coming from you!' He will reply, `Such was the case with your work, it stunk.' The unjust person will say, `How dirty are your clothes!' He will reply, `And your work too was dirty.' The unjust person will ask, `Who are you' He will reply, `I am your deeds.' So he will remain with the unjust person in his grave, and when he is resurrected on the Day of Resurrection, his companion will say to him, `In the life of the world, I used to carry you because you followed desire and lust. Today, you carry me.' So he will ride on the unjust person's back and lead him until he enters the Fire. So Allah said,  ﴾وَهُمْ يَحْمِلُونَ أَوْزَارَهُمْ عَلَى ظُهُورِهِمْ أَلاَ سَآءَ مَا يَزِرُونَ﴿ (while they will bear their burdens on their backs; and evil indeed are the burdens that they will bear!) 6:31\" Allah's statement,  ﴾وَمَا الْحَيَوةُ الدُّنْيَآ إِلاَّ لَعِبٌ وَلَهْوٌ﴿ (And the life of this world is nothing but play and amusement.) means, most of it is play and amusement,  ﴾وَلَلدَّارُ الاٌّخِرَةُ خَيْرٌ لِّلَّذِينَ يَتَّقُونَ أَفَلاَ تَعْقِلُونَ﴿ (But far better is the abode of the Hereafter for those who have Taqwa. Will you not then understand)  "
