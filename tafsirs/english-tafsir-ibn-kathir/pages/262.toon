  15,3,"<h2>Al-Hijr was revealed in Makkah</h2>﴾بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ ﴿ In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. <h2>The Disbelievers will someday wish that They had been Muslims</h2> We have already discussed the letters which appear at the beginning of some Surahs. Allah said: ﴾رُّبَمَا يَوَدُّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ﴿ (How much would those who disbelieved wish) Here Allah tells us that they will regret having lived in disbelief, and will wish that they had been Muslims in this world. Regarding Allah's saying, ﴾رُّبَمَا يَوَدُّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ لَوْ كَانُواْ مُسْلِمِينَ ﴿ (How much would those who disbelieved wish that they had been Muslims.) Sufyan Ath-Thawri reported from Salamah bin Kuhayl, who reported from Abi Az-Za`ra', from `Abdullah, who said: \"This is about the Jahannamiyyun (the sinners among the believers who will stay in Hell for some time), when they the disbelievers see them being brought out of Hell.\" ﴾رُّبَمَا يَوَدُّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ لَوْ كَانُواْ مُسْلِمِينَ ﴿ (How much would those who disbelieved wish that they had been Muslims.) Ibn Jarir reported that Ibn `Abbas and Anas bin Malik explained that this Ayah refers to the Day when Allah will detain the sinful Muslims in Hell along with the idolators. He said: \"The idolators will say to them, `What you used to worship on earth has not helped you.' Then by virtue of His mercy, Allah will be angry for their sake, and He will remove them from it. That is when ﴾رُّبَمَا يَوَدُّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ لَوْ كَانُواْ مُسْلِمِينَ ﴿ (How much would those who disbelieved wish that they had been Muslims).\" ﴾ذَرْهُمْ يَأْكُلُواْ وَيَتَمَتَّعُواْ﴿ (Leave them to eat and enjoy) this is a stern and definitive threat for them, like His saying, ﴾قُلْ تَمَتَّعُواْ فَإِنَّ مَصِيرَكُمْ إِلَى النَّارِ﴿ (Say: \"Enjoy your brief life! But certainly, your destination is the Fire!\") 14:30 ﴾كُلُواْ وَتَمَتَّعُواْ قَلِيلاً إِنَّكُمْ مُّجْرِمُونَ ﴿ ((O disbelievers!) Eat and enjoy yourselves (in this worldly life) for a little while. Verily, you are the guilty.)77:46 Allah says: ﴾وَيُلْهِهِمُ الاٌّمَلُ﴿ (let them be preoccupied with false hope.) i.e., distracted from repentance and turning to Allah, for ﴾فَسَوْفَ يَعْلَمُونَ﴿ (They will soon come to know!) that is, their punishment. "

  15,5,"<h2>Every Township has its allotted Time</h2> Allah is informing us that He never destroys a township until He has established evidences for it and its allotted time has ended. When the time for a nation's destruction has come, He never delays it, and He never moves its appointed time forward. This was a message and a warning to the people of Makkah, telling them to give up their Shirk, their stubbornness and disbelief for which they deserved to be destroyed. "

  15,9,"<h2>The Accusation that the Prophet was a Madman and Demands for Him to bring down Angels</h2> Allah tells us about the disbelief, arrogance and stubbornness of the disbelievers as reflected in their words: ﴾يأَيُّهَا الَّذِى نُزِّلَ عَلَيْهِ الذِّكْرُ﴿ (O you (Muhammad) to whom the Dhikr (the Qur'an) has been revealed!) i.e., the one who claims to receive it. ﴾إِنَّكَ لَمَجْنُونٌ﴿ (Verily, you are a mad man!) i.e., by your invitation to us to follow you and leave the way of our forefathers. ﴾لَّوْ مَا تَأْتِينَا بِالْمَلَـئِكَةِ﴿ (Why do you not bring angels to us) i.e., to bear witness to the accuracy of what you have brought to us is true, if you are really telling the truth This is similar to what Pharaoh said: ﴾فَلَوْلاَ أُلْقِىَ عَلَيْهِ أَسْوِرَةٌ مِّن ذَهَبٍ أَوْ جَآءَ مَعَهُ الْمَلَـئِكَةُ مُقْتَرِنِينَ ﴿ (Why then are not golden bracelets bestowed on him, or angels sent along with him)(43:53). And Allah said: ﴾وَقَالَ الَّذِينَ لاَ يَرْجُونَ لِقَآءَنَا لَوْلاَ أُنزِلَ عَلَيْنَا الْمَلَـئِكَةُ أَوْ نَرَى رَبَّنَا لَقَدِ اسْتَكْبَرُواْ فِى أَنفُسِهِمْ وَعَتَوْا عُتُوّاً كَبِيراً - يَوْمَ يَرَوْنَ الْمَلَـئِكَةَ لاَ بُشْرَى يَوْمَئِذٍ لِّلْمُجْرِمِينَ وَيَقُولُونَ حِجْراً مَّحْجُوراً ﴿ (And those who do not expect a meeting with Us (i. e., those who deny the Day of Resurrection and the life of the Hereafter), say: \"Why are not the angels sent down to us, or why do we not see our Lord\" Indeed they think too highly of themselves, and are scornful with great pride. On the Day that they do see the angels - there will be no good news given on that day to the guilty. And they (angels) will say: \"All kinds of glad tidings are forbidden for you.\") (25:21-22) For this reason Allah said: ﴾مَا نُنَزِّلُ الْمَلَـئِكَةَ إِلاَّ بِالحَقِّ وَمَا كَانُواْ إِذًا مُّنظَرِينَ ﴿ (We do not send the angels down except with the truth, and in that case, they (the disbelievers) would have no respite!) Mujahid said in this Ayah: ﴾مَا نُنَزِّلُ الْمَلَـئِكَةَ إِلاَّ بِالحَقِّ﴿ (We do not send the angels down except with the truth) \"i.e., with the Message and the punishment.\" Then Allah, may He be exalted, stated that He is the One Who revealed the Dhikr to him, which is the Qur'an, and He is protecting it from being changed or altered.

  15,13,"<h2>The Idolators of Every Nation made a Mockery of their Messengers</h2> Consoling His Messenger for the rejection of the disbelieving Quraysh, Allah says that He has sent Messengers before him to the nations of the past, and no Messenger came to a nation but they rejected him and mocked him. Then He tells him that He lets disbelief enter the hearts of those sinners who are too stubborn and too arrogant to follow His guidance. ﴾كَذَلِكَ نَسْلُكُهُ فِى قُلُوبِ الْمُجْرِمِينَ ﴿ (Thus We allow it to enter the hearts of the guilty.) Anas and Al-Hasan Al-Basri said that this referred to Shirk. ﴾وَقَدْ خَلَتْ سُنَّةُ الاٌّوَّلِينَ﴿ (and already the example of the ancients has gone forth.) meaning the destruction wrought by Allah on those who rejected His Messengers, and how He saved His Prophets and their followers in this world and in the Hereafter, is well known. "

  15,15,"<h2>The Stubborn Disbelievers will never believe, no matter what Signs and Wonders They see</h2> Allah explains the extent of their disbelief and stubborn resistance to the truth by stating that even if a door to heaven were to be opened for them, and they were to be taken up through it, they would still not believe. Rather, they would say: ﴾إِنَّمَا سُكِّرَتْ أَبْصَـرُنَا﴿ (Our eyes have been (as if) dazzled.) Mujahid, Ibn Kathir and Ad-Dahhak said, \"this means our vision has been blocked.\" Qatadah narrated that Ibn `Abbas said, \"this means our eyesight has been taken away.\" Al-`Awfi reported that Ibn `Abbas said, \"this means we were confused and put under a spell.\" ﴾سُكِّرَتْ أَبْصَـرُنَا﴿ (Our eyes have been (as if) dazzled.) Ibn Zayd said: \"The one who is dazzled lit. intoxicated is the one who cannot reason.\" "
