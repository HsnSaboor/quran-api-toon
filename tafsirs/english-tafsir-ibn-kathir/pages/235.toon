  11,119,"<h2>Allah has not made Faith universally accepted</h2> Allah, the Exalted, informs that He is able to make all of mankind one nation upon belief, or disbelief. This is just as He said,  وَلَوْ شَآءَ رَبُّكَ لآمَنَ مَن فِى الاٌّرْضِ كُلُّهُمْ جَمِيعًا  (And had your Lord willed, those on earth would have believed, all of them together.) 10:99 Allah goes on to say,  وَلاَ يَزَالُونَ مُخْتَلِفِينَإِلاَّ مَن رَّحِمَ رَبُّكَ  (but they will not cease to disagree. Except him on whom your Lord has bestowed His mercy,) This means that people will always differ in religions, creeds, beliefs, opinions and sects. Concerning Allah's statement,  إِلاَّ مَن رَّحِمَ رَبُّكَ  (Except him on whom your Lord has bestowed His mercy,) This means that those who have received the mercy of Allah by following the Messengers are excluded from this. They are those who adhere to what they are commanded in the religion by the Messengers of Allah ﷺ. That has always been their characteristic until the coming of the finality of the Prophets and Messengers (Muhammad ﷺ). Those who received Allah's mercy are those who followed him, believed in him and supported him. Therefore, they succeeded by achieving happiness in this life and the Hereafter. They are the Saved Sect mentioned in the Hadith recorded in the Musnad and Sunan collections of Hadith. The routes of transmission of this Hadith all strengthen each other (in authenticity). In these narrations the Prophet said,  «إِنَّ الْيَهُودَ افْتَرَقَتْ عَلَى إِحْدَى وَسَبْعِينَ فِرْقَةً، وَإِنَّ النَّصَارَى افْتَرَقَتْ عَلَى اثْنَتَيْنِ وَسَبْعِينَ فِرْقَةً، وَسَتَفْتَرِقُ هَذِهِ الْأُمَّةُ عَلَى ثَلَاثٍ وَسَبْعِينَ فِرْقَةً، كُلُّهَا فِي النَّارِ إِلَّا فِرْقَةً وَاحِدَة»  (Verily, the Jews split into seventy-one sects, and the Christians split into seventy-two sects, and this nation (of Muslims) will split into seventy-three sects. All of them will be in the Fire except one sect.) They (the Companions) said, \"Who are they (the Saved Sect) O Messenger of Allah\" He said,  «مَا أَنَا عَلَيْهِ وَأَصْحَابِي»  (The sect that is upon what my Companions and I are upon.) Al-Hakim recorded this narration in his Mustadrak with this additional wording. Concerning Allah's statement,  وَتَمَّتْ كَلِمَةُ رَبِّكَ لاّمْلاّنَّ جَهَنَّمَ مِنَ الْجِنَّةِ وَالنَّاسِ أَجْمَعِينَ  (And the Word of your Lord has been fulfilled (His saying): \"Surely, I shall fill Hell with Jinn and men all together.\") Allah, the Exalted, informs that He precedes everything in His preordainment and decree, by His perfect knowledge and penetrating wisdom. The result of this decree is that from those whom He has created, some deserve the Paradise and some deserve the Hell Fire. From this decree is that He will fill the Hellfire with both mankind and Jinns. His is the profound evidence and the perfect wisdom. In the Two Sahihs it is recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,  «اخْتَصَمَتِ الْجَنَّةُ وَالنَّارُ فَقَالَتِ الْجَنَّةُ: مَا لِي لَا يَدْخُلُنِي إِلَّا ضُعَفَاءُ النَّاسِ وَسَقَطُهُمْ وَقَالَتِ النَّارُ: أُوثِرْتُ بِالْمُتَكَبِّرِينَ وَالْمُتَجَبِّرِينَ. فَقَالَ اللهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ لِلْجَنَّةِ: أَنْتِ رَحْمَتِي أَرْحَمُ بِكِ مَنْ أَشَاءُ، وَقَالَ لِلنَّارِ: أَنْتِ عَذَابِي أَنْتَقِمُ بِكِ مِمَّنْ أَشَاءُ، وَلِكُلِّ وَاحِدَةٍ مِنْكُمَا مِلْؤُهَا، فَأَمَّا الْجَنَّةُ فَلَا يَزَالُ فِيهَا فَضْلٌ، حَتَّى يُنْشِىءَ اللهُ لَهَا خَلْقًا يُسْكِنُ فَضْلَ الْجَنَّةِ، وَأَمَّا النَّارُ فَلَا تَزَالُ تَقُولُ: هَلْ مِنْ مَزِيدٍ حَتَّى يَضَعَ عَلَيْهَا رَبُّ الْعِزَّةِ قَدَمَهُ فَتَقُولُ: قَطْ قَطْ وَعِزَّتِك»  (Paradise and the Hellfire debated. Paradise said, `None will enter me except the weak and despised of the people.' The Hell- fire said, `I have inherited the haughty and the arrogant people.' Then Allah said to the Paradise, `You are My mercy and I grant mercy with you to whoever I wish.' Then He said to the Hellfire, `You are My torment and I take vengeance with you upon whoever I wish. I will fill each one of you.' However, the Paradise will always have more bounties, to such an extent that Allah will create more creatures to dwell in it and enjoy its extra bounties. The Hellfire will continue saying, `Are there anymore (to enter me),' until the Lord of might places His Foot over it. Then it (Hell) will say, \"Enough, enough, by Your might!\") "
  11,120,"<h2>The Conclusion</h2> Allah, the Exalted, is saying, `We relate all of these stories to you (Muhammad) concerning what happened with the Messengers who came before you with their nations. This is an explanation of what transpired in their arguments and disputes and how the Prophets were all rejected and harmed. These stories also explain how Allah helped His party of believers and disgraced His enemies, the disbelievers. We relate all of this to you (Muhammad) in order to make your heart firm and so that you may take an example from your brothers who passed before you of the Messengers.' Concerning Allah's statement,  ﴾وَجَآءَكَ فِى هَـذِهِ الْحَقُّ﴿ (And in this has come to you the truth,) This is referring to this Surah itself. This was said by Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid and a group of the Salaf and it is the correct view. This means, `This comprehensive Surah contains the stories of the Prophets and how Allah saved them, and the believers along with them and how He destroyed the disbelievers. There has come to you (Muhammad) stories of truth and true events in this Surah. In this Surah is an admonition that prevents the disbelievers, and a reminder that causes the believers to reflect.'  "

  11,122,"<h2>Allah, the Exalted, commands His Messenger to say to those who disbelieve in what he has come ...</h2>﴾اعْمَلُواْ عَلَى مَكَانَتِكُمْ﴿ (Act according to your ability) This means upon your path and your way.  ﴾إِنَّا عَامِلُونَ﴿ (We are acting (in our way). This means that we are upon our path and our way (Islam).  ﴾وَانْتَظِرُواْ إِنَّا مُنتَظِرُونَ ﴿ (And you wait ! We (too) are waiting.) This means,  ﴾فَسَوْفَ تَعْلَمُونَ مَن تَكُونُ لَهُ عَـقِبَةُ الدَّارِ إِنَّهُ لاَ يُفْلِحُ الظَّـلِمُونَ﴿ (And you will come to know for which of us will be the (happy) end in the Hereafter. Certainly the wrongdoers will not be successful.)6:135 Verily, Allah fulfilled His promise to His Messenger , helped him and aided him. He made His Word uppermost (victorious), and the word of those who disbelieved lowly and disgraced. Allah is truly the Most Mighty, Most Wise.  "
  11,123,"<h2>Allah, the Exalted, informs that He is the All-Knower of the unseenof the heavens and the earth and that unto Him is the final return.</h2> He explains that everyone who does a deed, He will give them their deed (reward for it) on the Day of Reckoning. Unto Him belongs the creation and the command. Then He, the Exalted, commands that He should be worshipped and relied upon, for verily, He is sufficient for whoever trusts and turns to Him. Concerning His statement,  ﴾وَمَا رَبُّكَ بِغَـفِلٍ عَمَّا تَعْمَلُونَ﴿ (And your Lord is not unaware of what you do.) This means, `The lies (of the disbelievers) against you O Muhammad are not hidden from Him. He is the All-Knower of the conditions of His creatures and He will give them the perfect recompense for their deeds in this life and the Hereafter. He will aid you (Muhammad) and His party over the disbelievers in this life and in the Hereafter.' This is the end of the Tafsir of Surah Hud, and all praises and thanks are due to Allah. "

  12,3,"<h2>Which was revealed in Makkah</h2> بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ  In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. <h2>Qualities of the Qur'an</h2> In the beginning of Surat Al-Baqarah we talked about the separate letters, Allah said,  تِلْكَ ءايَـتُ الْكِتَـبِ  (These are the verses of the Book) in reference to the Clear Qur'an that is plain and apparent, and explains, clarifies and makes known the unclear matters. Allah said next,  إِنَّآ أَنْزَلْنَاهُ قُرْآنًا عَرَبِيًّا لَّعَلَّكُمْ تَعْقِلُونَ  (Verily, We have sent it down as an Arabic Qur'an in order that you may understand.) The Arabic language is the most eloquent, plain, deep and expressive of the meanings that might arise in one's mind. Therefore, the most honorable Book, was revealed in the most honorable language, to the most honorable Prophet and Messenger , delivered by the most honorable angel, in the most honorable land on earth, and its revelation started during the most honorable month of the year, Ramadan. Therefore, the Qur'an is perfect in every respect. So Allah said,  نَحْنُ نَقُصُّ عَلَيْكَ أَحْسَنَ الْقَصَصِ بِمَآ أَوْحَيْنَآ إِلَيْكَ هَـذَا الْقُرْءَانَ  (We relate unto you the best of stories through Our revelations unto you, of this Qur'an.) <h2>Reason behind revealing Ayah (12:3)</h2> On the reason behind revealing Ayah (12:3), Ibn Jarir At-Tabari recorded that `Abdullah bin `Abbas said, \"They said, `O, Allah's Messenger! Why not narrate to us stories' Later on, this Ayah was revealed,  نَحْنُ نَقُصُّ عَلَيْكَ أَحْسَنَ الْقَصَصِ  (We relate unto you the best of stories...)\" There is a Hadith that is relevant upon mentioning this honorable Ayah, which praises the Qur'an and demonstrates that it is sufficient from needing all books besides it. Imam Ahmad recorded a narration from Jabir bin `Abdullah that `Umar bin Al-Khattab came to the Prophet with a book that he took from some of the People of the Book. `Umar began reading it to the Prophet who became angry. He said,  «أَمُتَهَوِّكُونَ فِيهَا يَا ابْنَ الْخَطَّابِ؟ وَالَّذِي نَفْسِي بِيَدِهِ، لَقَدْ جِئْتُكُمْ بِهَا بَيْضَاءَ نَقِيَّةً، لَا تَسْأَلُوهُمْ عَنْ شَيْءٍ فَيُخْبِرُوكُمْ بِحَقَ فَتُكَذِّبُونَهُ، أَوْ بِبَاطِلٍ فَتُصَدِّقُونَهُ، وَالَّذِي نَفْسِي بِيَدِهِ، لَوْ أَنَّ مُوسَى كَانَ حَيًّا مَا وَسِعَهُ إِلَّا أَنْ يَتَّبِعَنِي»  (Are you uncertain about it Ibn Al-Khattab By the One in Whose Hand is my soul! I have come to you with it white and pure. Do not ask them about anything, for they might tell you something true and you reject it, or they might tell you something false and you believe it. By the One in Whose Hand is my soul! If Musa were living, he would have no choice but to follow me.) Imam Ahmad also recorded a narration from `Abdullah bin Thabit who said, \"`Umar came to Allah's Messenger ﷺ and said; `O Messenger of Allah! I passed by a brother of mine from the tribe of Qurayzah, so he wrote some comprehensive statements from the Tawrah for me, should I read them to you' The face of Allah's Messenger ﷺ changed with anger. So I said to him, `Don't you see the face of Allah's Messenger ﷺ\" `Umar said, `We are pleased with Allah as our Lord, Islam as our religion, and Muhammad ﷺ as our Messenger.' So the anger of the Prophet subsided, and he said,  «وَالَّذِي نَفْسُ مُحَمَّدٍ بِيَدِهِ، لَوْ أَصْبَحَ فِيكُمْ مُوسَى ثُمَّ اتَّبَعْتُمُوهُ وَتَرَكْتُمُونِي لَضَلَلْتُمْ، إِنَّكُمْ حَظِّي مِنَ الْأُمَمِ، وَأَنَا حَظُّكُمْ مِنَ النَّبِيِّين»  (By the One in Whose Hand is Muhammad's soul, if Musa appeared among you and you were to follow him, abandoning me, then you would have strayed. Indeed you are my share of the nations, and I am your share of the Prophets.)\" "
  12,4,"<h2>Yusuf's Dream</h2> Allah says, `Mention to your people, O Muhammad, among the stories that you narrate to them, the story of Yusuf.' Prophet Yusuf (Joseph) mentioned his dream to his father, Prophet Ya`qub (Jacob), son of Prophet Ishaq (Isaac), son of Prophet Ibrahim (Abraham), peace be upon them all. `Abdullah bin `Abbas stated that the dreams of Prophets are revelations from Allah. Scholars of Tafsir explained that in Yusuf's dream the eleven stars represent his brothers, who were eleven, and the sun and the moon represent his father and mother. This explanation was collected from Ibn `Abbas, Ad-Dahhak, Qatadah, Sufyan Ath-Thawri and `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam. Yusuf's vision became a reality forty years later, or as some say, eighty years, when Yusuf raised his parents to the throne while his brothers were before him,  ﴾وَخَرُّواْ لَهُ سُجَّدَا وَقَالَ يأَبَتِ هَـذَا تَأْوِيلُ رُؤْيَـى مِن قَبْلُ قَدْ جَعَلَهَا رَبِّى حَقًّا﴿ (and they fell down before him prostrate. And he said: \"O my father! This is the interpretation of my dream aforetime! My Lord has made it come true!\")  "
