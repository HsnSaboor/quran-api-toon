  15,56,"<h2>The Guests of Ibrahim and their Good News of a Son for Him</h2> Allah is saying: `Tell them, O Muhammad, about the story of ﴾ضَيْفِ إِبْرَاهِيمَ﴿ (the guests of Ibrahim.)' ﴾دَخَلُواْ عَلَيْهِ فَقَالُواْ سَلامًا قَالَ إِنَّا مِنْكُمْ وَجِلُونَ﴿ (they entered upon him, and said: \"Salaman (peace!).\" He said: \"Indeed we are frightened of you.\") meaning that they were scared. The reason for their fear has been mentioned previously, which is that they noticed that these guests did not eat of the food that was offered, which was a fattened calf. ﴾قَالُواْ لاَ تَوْجَلْ﴿ (They said: \"Do not be afraid!...\") meaning, do not be scared. ﴾وَبَشَّرُوهُ بِغُلَـمٍ عَلَيمٍ﴿ (We bring you the good news of a boy possessing much knowledge and wisdom.) this refers to Ishaq, as was previously mentioned in Surat Hud. Then ﴾قَالَ﴿ (He said) meaning he spoke with wonder and astonishment, asking for confirmation, because he was old and his wife was old: ﴾أَبَشَّرْتُمُونِى عَلَى أَن مَّسَّنِىَ الْكِبَرُ فَبِمَ تُبَشِّرُونَ﴿ (Do you give me this good news while old age has overtaken me Of what then is your news about) They responded by confirming the good news they had brought, good news after good news: ﴾قَالُواْ بَشَّرْنَـكَ بِالْحَقِّ فَلاَ تَكُن مِّنَ الْقَـنِطِينَ ﴿ (They said: \"We give you good news in truth. So do not be of those who despair.\") "

  15,60,"<h2>The Reason why the Angels came</h2> Allah tells us that after Ibrahim had calmed down from the excitement of this good news, he started to ask them why they had come to him. They said, ﴾إِنَّآ أُرْسِلْنَآ إِلَى قَوْمٍ مُّجْرِمِينَ﴿ (We have been sent to a guilty people.) meaning the people of Lut. They told him that they were going to save the family of Lut from among those people, except for his wife, because she was one of those who were doomed. Thus it was said, ﴾إِلاَّ امْرَأَتَهُ قَدَّرْنَآ إِنَّهَا لَمِنَ الْغَـبِرِينَ ﴿ (Except for his wife, of whom We have decreed that she shall be of those who remain behind.) i.e., she was one of those who would be left behind and will be destroyed.

  15,64,"<h2>The Angels coming to Lut</h2> Allah tells us about when the angels came to Lut in the form of young men with handsome faces. When they entered his home, he said: ﴾قَالَ إِنَّكُمْ قَوْمٌ مُّنكَرُونَ - قَالُواْ بَلْ جِئْنَـكَ بِمَا كَانُواْ فِيهِ يَمْتَرُونَ ﴿ (\"Verily, you are people unknown to me.\" They said: \"Nay, we have come to you with that (torment) which they have been doubting.\") meaning that they were bringing the punishment and destruction that the people doubted they would ever suffer from. ﴾وَآتَيْنَـكَ بِالْحَقِّ﴿ (And we have brought you the truth) is like the Ayah, ﴾مَا نُنَزِّلُ الْمَلَـئِكَةَ إِلاَّ بِالحَقِّ﴿ (We do not send the angels down except with the truth) 15:8 and ﴾وِإِنَّا لَصَـدِقُونَ﴿ (and certainly, we tell the truth.) They said this in affirmation of the news that they brought him, that he would be saved and his people would be destroyed. "

  15,66,"<h2>Lut is ordered to leave with His Family during the Night</h2> Allah tells us that His angels ordered Lut to set out after part of the night had passed. They told him to walk behind them, to protect them. Similarly, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ would walk in the rear of the army on military campaigns, in order to help the weak and carry those who had no means of transport.  وَلاَ يَلْتَفِتْ مِنكُمْ أَحَدٌ  (and let no one amongst you look back,) meaning - when you hear the people screaming from their torment, do not turn around to look at them; leave them to face whatever punishment and vengeance is coming to them.  وَامْضُواْ حَيْثُ تُؤْمَرُونَ  (but go on to where you are ordered.) - it is as if they had a guide with them to show them the way.  وَقَضَيْنَآ إِلَيْهِ ذَلِكَ الاٌّمْرَ  (And We made this decree known to him) meaning - We already told him about that.  أَنَّ دَابِرَ هَـؤُلآْءِ مَقْطُوعٌ مُّصْبِحِينَ  (that those (sinners) would be rooted out in the early morning.) meaning in the morning, as in another Ayah:  إِنَّ مَوْعِدَهُمُ الصُّبْحُ أَلَيْسَ الصُّبْحُ بِقَرِيبٍ  (Indeed, morning is their appointed time. Is not the morning near) 11:81 "
