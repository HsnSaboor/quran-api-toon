  20,70,"<h2>The Competition, Musa's Victory, and the Magician's Faith</h2> Allah, the Exalted, informs about the magicians when they met Musa, that they said to Musa,  ﴾إِمَّآ أَن تُلْقِىَ﴿ (\"Either you throw first...\") meaning, \"you go first.\"  ﴾وَإِمَّآ أَن نَّكُونَ أَوَّلَ مَنْ أَلْقَىقَالَ بَلْ أَلْقُواْ﴿ (\"...or we be the first to throw\" (Musa) said: \"Nay, throw you (first)!\") This means, `you magicians should go first so that we can see what magic you are going to perform and so that the true state of their affair will become obvious to the people.'  ﴾فَإِذَا حِبَالُهُمْ وَعِصِيُّهُمْ يُخَيَّلُ إِلَيْهِ مِن سِحْرِهِمْ أَنَّهَا تَسْعَى﴿ (Then behold! their ropes and their sticks, by their magic, appeared to him as though they moved fast.) In another Ayah it says that when they threw,  ﴾وَقَالُواْ بِعِزَّةِ فِرْعَونَ إِنَّا لَنَحْنُ الْغَـلِبُونَ﴿ (Then said: \"By the might of Fir`awn, it is we who will certainly win!\") 26:44 And Allah, the Exalted, says,  ﴾سَحَرُواْ أَعْيُنَ النَّاسِ وَاسْتَرْهَبُوهُمْ وَجَآءُو بِسِحْرٍ عَظِيمٍ﴿ (They bewitched the eyes of the people, and struck terror into them, and they displayed a great magic.) 7:116 Here, He says in this Surah,  ﴾فَإِذَا حِبَالُهُمْ وَعِصِيُّهُمْ يُخَيَّلُ إِلَيْهِ مِن سِحْرِهِمْ أَنَّهَا تَسْعَى﴿ (Then behold! their ropes and their sticks, by their magic, appeared to him as though they moved fast.) They were a large numbered group and each one of them threw a stick and a rope until the valley became full of snakes piled on top of each other. Concerning Allah's statement,  ﴾فَأَوْجَسَ فِى نَفْسِهِ خِيفَةً مُّوسَى ﴿ (So Musa conceived fear in himself.) This means that he feared for the people that they would be tested and deceived by their magic before he could even have a chance to throw what was in his right hand. Thus, Allah revealed to him at the right moment, to throw what was in his right hand, which was the stick. When he did so, it swallowed what they had made. It became a huge, monstrous creature with legs, a neck, a head and fangs. It went after these ropes and sticks until none of them remained, except that it was devoured and swallowed by this beast. At the same time, the magicians and all of the people were watching with their own eyes, seeing this amazing event in broad daylight. Thus, the miracle was performed and the evidence was clear. The truth prevailed and the magic was proven to be falsehood. This is why Allah said,  ﴾إِنَّمَا صَنَعُواْ كَيْدُ سَاحِرٍ وَلاَ يُفْلِحُ السَّـحِرُ حَيْثُ أَتَى﴿ (That which they have made is only a magician's trick, and the magician will never be successful, to whatever amount (of skill) he may attain.) So when the magicians saw the event and witnessed it with their own eyes, while they were knowledgeable of the various tricks and methods in the sciences of magic, they knew with conviction that what Musa had done was not magic or illusionary tricks. They recognized that it was the truth without any doubt. They knew that no one had any power to do this except for One Who says for a thing \"Be,\" and it is. Therefore, when this happened, they fell down into prostration to Allah. They said, \"We believe in the Lord of all that exists, the Lord of Musa and Harun!\" This is why Ibn `Abbas and `Ubayd bin `Umayr both said, \"At the beginning of the day they were magicians and at the end of the day they were outstanding witnesses of faith.\" l  <h2>The Number of Magicians</h2> Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Ibn `Abbas said, \"The magicians were seventy men who were magicians in the morning, but witnesses of faith by the time evening came.\" Ibn Abi Hatim also reported that Al-Awza'i said, \"When the magicians fell down in prostration, Paradise was raised up before them until they were looking at it.\" It is reported from Sa`id bin Jubayr that he said concerning Allah's statement,  ﴾فَأُلْقِىَ السَّحَرَةُ سُجَّداً﴿ (So the magicians fell down prostrate.) \"They saw their places (in Paradise) made clear before them while they were in their prostration.\" `Ikrimah and Al-Qasim bin Abi Bizzah both said the same.

  20,73,"<h2>Fir`awn's turning against the Magicians, His threatening Them and Their Reply</h2> Allah, the Exalted, informs of Fir`awn's disbelief, obstinance, transgression and haughtiness against the truth in favor of falsehood. When he saw what he saw of the magnificent miracle and the great sign, and he saw those whose help he sought accept faith in the presence of all of the people, and he was absolutely defeated, he began to behave arrogantly and cast accusations. He resorted to using his esteemed honor and might against the magicians. He warned them and threatened them saying,  ﴾ءَامَنتُمْ لَهُ﴿ (Believe you in him (Musa)) This means, \"Do you have faith in him\"  ﴾قَبْلَ أَنْ ءَاذَنَ لَكُمْ﴿ (before I give you permission) meaning, \"I have not commanded you to do so, by which you have rebelled against me.\" Then he said a statement that he, the magicians and all creatures knew was a forgery and an utter lie.  ﴾إِنَّهُ لَكَبِيرُكُمُ الَّذِى عَلَّمَكُمُ السِّحْرَ﴿ (Verily, he is your chief who has taught you magic.) meaning \"You all only took your magic from Musa and you have made an agreement with him against me and my subjects, that you would help him be victorious.\" Allah says in another Ayah,  ﴾إِنَّ هَـذَا لَمَكْرٌ مَّكَرْتُمُوهُ فِى الْمَدِينَةِ لِتُخْرِجُواْ مِنْهَآ أَهْلَهَا فَسَوْفَ تَعْلَمُونَ﴿ (Surely, this is a plot which you have plotted in the city to drive out its people, but you shall come to know.) 7:123 Then he began threatening them. He said to them,  ﴾فَلأُقَطِّعَنَّ أَيْدِيَكُمْ وَأَرْجُلَكُمْ مِّنْ خِلاَفٍ وَلأُصَلِّبَنَّكُمْ فِى جُذُوعِ النَّخْلِ﴿ (So I will surely cut off your hands and feet on opposite sides, and I will surely crucify you on the trunks of date palms,) meaning, \"I will certainly make an example of you, I will kill you in a public execution.\" Ibn `Abbas said, \"Thus, he was the first person to ever do this (public execution, crucifixion).\" This was reported by Ibn Abi Hatim. Concerning Allah's statement,  ﴾وَلَتَعْلَمُنَّ أَيُّنَآ أَشَدُّ عَذَاباً وَأَبْقَى﴿ (And you shall surely know which of us can give the severe and more lasting torment.) This means, \"You say that my people and I are astray and that you (magicians), Musa and his people are following correct guidance, but you will come to know who will be punished and remain punished.\" So when he attacked with this and threatened them, their souls eased them because of their belief in Allah, the Mighty and Sublime. They exclaimed,  ﴾قَالُواْ لَن نُّؤْثِرَكَ عَلَى مَا جَآءَنَا مِنَ الْبَيِّنَـتِ﴿ (They said: \"We prefer you not over what have come to us of the clear signs...\") meaning, \"We do not chose you over the guidance and conviction that we have received. \"  ﴾وَالَّذِى فَطَرَنَا﴿ (and to Him (Allah) Who created us.) It could be that they were swearing, \"By He Who has created us.\" It also could be connected in meaning to the clear signs mentioned before it. In this case it would mean, \"We do not prefer you over our Originator and Creator, Who produced us from a beginning that was nothing. He created us from clay (or mud). Therefore, He alone deserves worship and humility and you do not (Fir`awn)!\"  ﴾فَاقْضِ مَآ أَنتَ قَاضٍ﴿ (So decree whatever you desire to decree,) \"Do whatever you wish and whatever your hands are able to achieve.\"  ﴾إِنَّمَا تَقْضِى هَـذِهِ الْحَيَوةَ الدُّنْيَآ﴿ (for you can only decree (regarding) this life of the world.) meaning, \"You only have power in this world and it is a world that will come to an end. Verily, we are hoping in the eternal abode.\"  ﴾إِنَّآ آمَنَّا بِرَبِّنَا لِيَغْفِرَ لَنَا خَطَـيَـنَا﴿ (Verily, we have believed in our Lord, that He may forgive us our faults,) \"Whatever evils that we did.\" It specifically means, `which we were forced to do of magic, in order to oppose the sign of Allah and the miracle of His Prophet.' Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Ibn `Abbas said concerning Allah's statement,  ﴾وَمَآ أَكْرَهْتَنَا عَلَيْهِ مِنَ السِّحْرِ﴿ (and the magic to which you compelled us.) \"Fir`awn took forty boys from the Children of Israel and commanded that they be taught magic at Al-Farama. He said, `Teach them knowledge that no one in the land knows.\"' Ibn `Abbas then said, \"They were of those who believed in Musa and they were of those who said,  ﴾آمَنَّا بِرَبِّنَا لِيَغْفِرَ لَنَا خَطَـيَـنَا وَمَآ أَكْرَهْتَنَا عَلَيْهِ مِنَ السِّحْرِ﴿ (We have believed in our Lord, that He may forgive us our faults, and the magic to which you did compel us.)\" `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam said the same. Allah's statement,  ﴾وَاللَّهُ خَيْرٌ وَأَبْقَى﴿ (And Allah is better as regards reward in comparison to your reward, and more lasting.) means, \"He is better for us than you.\"  ﴾وَأَبْقَى﴿ (and more lasting.) More lasting in reward than what you pro- mised us and made us aspire to. It is apparent that Fir`awn (may Allah curse him) was bent upon their punishment, and that what he did to them was a mercy from Allah for them. This is why Ibn `Abbas and others of the Salaf said, \"They woke up in that morning as magicians, but they became witnesses of faith by the evening. \"  "

  20,76,"<h2>The Magicians admonish Fir`awn</h2> The clear intent of this is to be a completion of what the magicians admonished Fir`awn with. They warned him of the vengeance of Allah and His eternal and everlasting punishment. They also encouraged him to seek Allah's eternal and endless reward. They said,  إِنَّهُ مَن يَأْتِ رَبَّهُ مُجْرِماً  (Verily, whoever comes to his Lord as a criminal,) This means, whoever meets Allah on the Day of Judgment while being a criminal.  فَإِنَّ لَهُ جَهَنَّمَ لاَ يَمُوتُ فِيهَا وَلاَ يَحْيَى  (then surely, for him is Hell, wherein he will neither die nor live.) This is similar to Allah's statement,  لاَ يُقْضَى عَلَيْهِمْ فَيَمُوتُواْ وَلاَ يُخَفَّفُ عَنْهُمْ مِّنْ عَذَابِهَا كَذَلِكَ نَجْزِى كُلَّ كَفُورٍ  (Neither will it have a complete killing effect on them so that they die, nor shall its torment be lightened for them. Thus do We requite every disbeliever!) 35:36 Allah also said,  وَيَتَجَنَّبُهَا الاٌّشْقَى - الَّذِى يَصْلَى النَّارَ الْكُبْرَى - ثُمَّ لاَ يَمُوتُ فِيهَا وَلاَ يَحْيَا  (But it will be avoided by the wretched, who will enter the great Fire. There he will neither die nor live.) 87:11-13  وَنَادَوْاْ يمَـلِكُ لِيَقْضِ عَلَيْنَا رَبُّكَ قَالَ إِنَّكُمْ مَّـكِثُونَ  (And they will cry: \"O Malik (Keeper of Hell)! Let your Lord made an end of us.\" He will say: \"Verily, you shall abide forever.\") 43:77 Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal recorded that Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,  «أَمَّا أَهْلُ النَّارِ الَّذِينَ هُمْ أَهْلُهَا، فَإِنَّهُمْ لَا يَمُوتُونَ فِيهَا وَلَا يَحْيَوْنَ، وَلكِنْ أُنَاسٌ تُصِيبُهُمُ النَّارُ بِذُنُوبِهِمْ فَتُمِيتُهُمْ إِمَاتَةً حَتَّى إِذَا صَارُوا فَحْمًا أُذِنَ فِي الشَّفَاعَةِ فَجِيءَ بِهِمْ ضَبَائِرَ ضَبَائِرَ، فَبُثُّوا عَلَى أَنْهَارِ الْجَنَّةِ، فَيُقَالُ: يَا أَهْلَ الْجَنَّةِ أَفِيضُوا عَلَيْهِمْ، فَيَنْبُتُونَ نَبَاتَ الْحِبَّةِ تَكُونُ فِي حَمِيلِ السَّيْل»  (The dwellers of Hellfire, who are those who deserve it, they will not die in it, nor will they be living. Rather, they will be a people who will be punished by the Fire due to their sins. It will be gradually killing them and devouring them until they become burnt coals. Then, intercession will be allowed and they will be brought (out of Hell) group by group and they will be spread on the rivers of Paradise. It will then be said, \"O people of Paradise, pour (water) over them.\" Then, they will start to grow like the growing of a seed on the muddy banks of a flowing river.) A man among the people said, \"It is as if the Messenger of Allah ﷺ lived in the desert.\" This is how Muslim recorded this narration in his Sahih. Concerning Allah's statement,  وَمَن يَأْتِهِ مُؤْمِناً قَدْ عَمِلَ الصَّـلِحَـتِ  (But whoever comes to Him (Allah) as a believer, and has done righteous good deeds,) whoever meets his Lord on the Day of Judgment as a believer in his heart, then verily, his intentions in his heart will be affirmed to be true by his statements and deeds.  فَأُوْلَـئِكَ لَهُمُ الدَّرَجَـتُ الْعُلَى  (for such are the high ranks,) Paradise, which has the highest levels, the most tranquil rooms and the nicest homes. Imam Ahmad reported from `Ubadah bin As-Samit that the Prophet said,  «الْجَنَّةُ مِائَةُ دَرَجَةٍ مَا بَيْنَ كُلِّ دَرَجَتَيْنِ كَمَا بَيْنَ السَّمَاءِ وَالْأَرْضِ، وَالْفِرْدَوْسُ أَعْلَاهَا دَرَجَةً، وَمِنْهَا تَخْرُجُ الْأَنْهَارُ الْأَرْبَعَةُ، وَالْعَرْشُ فَوْقَهَا، فَإِذَا سَأَلْتُمُ اللهَ فَاسْأَلُوهُ الْفِرْدَوْس»  (Paradise has one hundred levels and between each level is a distance like the distance between the sky and the earth. Al-Firdaws is the name of the highest of its levels. From it springs the four rivers and the Throne is above it. Therefore, when you ask Allah, then ask Him for Al-Firdaws.) This narration was also recorded by At-Tirmidhi. In the Two Sahihs it is recorded that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,  «إِنَّ أَهْلَ عِلِّيِّينَ لَيَرَوْنَ مَنْ فَوْقَهُمْ كَمَا تَرَوْنَ الْكَوْكَبَ الْغَابِرَ فِي أُفُقِ السَّمَاءِ لِتَفَاضُلِ مَا بَيْنَهُمْ قَالُوا: يَا رَسُولَ اللهِ تِلْكَ مَنَازِلُ الْأَنْبِيَاءِ قَالَ: بَلى، وَالَّذِي نَفْسِي بِيَدِهِ رِجَالٌ آمَنُوا بِاللهِ وَصَدَّقُوا الْمُرْسَلِين»  (Verily, the people of the `Illiyyin will see those who are above them just as you see the fading star in the horizon of the sky, due to the different status of virtue between them. ) The people said, \"O Messenger of Allah ﷺ, these are the dwellings of the Prophets.\" He replied, (Of course. And I swear by the One Whom my soul is in His Hand, (it is for) men who had faith in Allah and they believed the Messengers.) In the Sunan collections this narration is mentioned with the additional wording,  «وَإِنَّ أَبَا بَكْرٍ وَعُمَرَ لَمِنْهُمْ وَأَنْعَمَا»  (And verily Abu Bakr and `Umar are of them and they will be most favored.) His saying,  جَنَّـتِ عَدْنٍ  (Adn Gardens,) meaning established as a residence. It is merely used here in reference to the high ranks mentioned previously.  تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهَا الاٌّنْهَارُ خَـالِدِينَ فِيهَا  (under which rivers flow, wherein they will abide forever,) meaning that they will abide in it for eternity.  وَذلِكَ جَزَآءُ مَن تَزَكَّى  (and such is the reward of those who purify themselves.) One who purifies himself from dirt, filth and associating partners with Allah. This is the person who worships Allah alone, without ascribing partners to Him, and he follows the Messengers in the good they came with all that they claim. "
