  3,184,"<h2>Allah Warns the Idolators</h2> Sa`id bin Jubayr said that Ibn `Abbas said, \"When Allah's statement,  ﴾مَّن ذَا الَّذِى  يُقْرِضُ اللَّهَ قَرْضًا حَسَنًا فَيُضَاعِفَهُ لَهُ أَضْعَافًا كَثِيرَةً﴿ (Who is he that will lend to Allah a goodly loan so that He may multiply it  to him many times) 2:245 was revealed, the Jews said, `O Muhammad! Has your  Lord become poor so that He asks His servants to give Him a loan' Allah sent  down,  ﴾لَّقَدْ سَمِعَ  اللَّهُ قَوْلَ الَّذِينَ قَالُواْ إِنَّ اللَّهَ فَقِيرٌ وَنَحْنُ  أَغْنِيَآءُ﴿ (Indeed, Allah has heard the statement of those (Jews) who say: \"Truly, Allah  is poor and we are rich!\") 3:181.\"   This Hadith was collected by Ibn Marduwyah and Ibn Abi Hatim.   Allah's statement,  ﴾سَنَكْتُبُ مَا  قَالُواْ﴿ (We shall record what they have said) contains a threat and a warning that  Allah followed with His statement,  ﴾وَقَتْلِهِمُ  الاٌّنْبِيَآءَ بِغَيْرِ حَقٍّ﴿ (and their killing of the Prophets unjustly,)   This is what they say about Allah and this is how they treat His Messengers.  Allah will punish them for these deeds in the worst manner,  ﴾لَّقَدْ سَمِعَ  اللَّهُ قَوْلَ الَّذِينَ قَالُواْ إِنَّ اللَّهَ فَقِيرٌ وَنَحْنُ أَغْنِيَآءُ  سَنَكْتُبُ مَا قَالُواْ وَقَتْلَهُمُ الاٌّنبِيَاءَ بِغَيْرِ حَقٍّ وَنَقُولُ  ذُوقُواْ عَذَابَ الْحَرِيقِ - ذلِكَ بِمَا قَدَّمَتْ أَيْدِيكُمْ وَأَنَّ اللَّهَ  لَيْسَ بِظَلَّـمٍ لِّلْعَبِيدِ ﴿ (and We shall say: \"Taste you the torment of the burning (Fire).\" This is  because of that which your hands have sent before you. And certainly, Allah is  never unjust to (His) servants.)   They will be addressed like this as a way of chastising, criticism, disgrace  and humiliation.   Allah said,  ﴾الَّذِينَ قَالُواْ  إِنَّ اللَّهَ عَهِدَ إِلَيْنَا أَلاَّ نُؤْمِنَ لِرَسُولٍ حَتَّى يَأْتِيَنَا  بِقُرْبَانٍ تَأْكُلُهُ النَّارُ﴿ (Those (Jews) who said: \"Verily, Allah has taken our promise not to believe  in any Messenger unless he brings to us an offering which the fire (from heaven)  shall devour.\")   Allah refuted their claim that in their Books, Allah took a covenant from  them to only believe in the Messenger whose miracles include fire coming down  from the sky that consumes the charity offered by a member of the Messenger's  nation, as Ibn `Abbas and Al-Hasan stated. Allah replied,  ﴾قُلْ قَدْ جَآءَكُمْ  رُسُلٌ مِّن قَبْلِى بِالْبَيِّنَـتِ﴿ (Say: \"Verily, there came to you Messengers before me, with Al-Bayinat...\")  with proofs and evidence,  ﴾وَبِالَّذِى  قُلْتُمْ﴿ (and even with what you speak of) a fire that consumes the accepted charity,  as you asked,  ﴾فَلِمَ  قَتَلْتُمُوهُمْ﴿ (why then did you kill them) Why did you meet these Prophets with denial,  defiance, stubbornness and even murder,  ﴾إِن كُنتُمْ  صَـدِقِينَ﴿ (if you are truthful), if you follow the truth and obey the Messengers.   Allah then comforts His Prophet Muhammad ,  ﴾فَإِن كَذَّبُوكَ  فَقَدْ كُذِّبَ رُسُلٌ مِّن قَبْلِكَ جَآءُوا بِالْبَيِّنَـتِ وَالزُّبُرِ  وَالْكِتَـبِ الْمُنِيرِ ﴿ (Then if they reject you, so were Messengers rejected before you, who came  with Al-Baiyyinat and the Scripture, and the Book of Enlightenment.) meaning, do  not be sad because they deny you, for you have an example in the Messengers who  came before you. These Messengers were rejected although they brought clear  proofs, plain evidence and unequivocal signs,  ﴾وَالزُّبُرِ﴿ (and the Zubur), the divinely revealed Books that were sent down to the  Messengers,  ﴾وَالْكِتَـبِ  الْمُنِيرِ﴿ (and the Book of Enlightenment) meaning the clarification and best  explanation.

  3,186,"<h2>Every Soul Shall Taste Death</h2> Allah issues a general and encompassing statement that every living soul shall taste death. In another statement, Allah said,  كُلُّ مَنْ عَلَيْهَا فَانٍ - وَيَبْقَى وَجْهُ رَبِّكَ ذُو الْجَلْـلِ وَالإِكْرَامِ  (Whatsoever is on it (the earth) will perish. And the Face of your Lord full of majesty and honor will remain forever) 55:26,27.  Therefore, Allah Alone is the Ever-Living Who never dies, while the Jinn, mankind and angels, including those who carry Allah's Throne, shall die. The Irresistible One and Only, will alone remain for ever and ever, remaining Last, as He was the First. This Ayah comforts all creation, since every soul that exists on the earth shall die. When the term of this life comes to an end and the sons of Adam no longer have any new generations, and thus this world ends, Allah will command that the Day of Resurrection commence. Allah will then recompense the creation for their deeds, whether minor or major, many or few, big or small. Surely, Allah will not deal unjustly with anyone, even the weight of an atom, and this is why He said,  وَإِنَّمَا تُوَفَّوْنَ أُجُورَكُمْ يَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ  (185. And only on the Day of Resurrection shall you be paid your wages in full) <h2>Who Shall Gain Ultimate Victory</h2> Allah said,  فَمَن زُحْزِحَ عَنِ النَّارِ وَأُدْخِلَ الْجَنَّةَ فَقَدْ فَازَ  (And whoever is moved away from the Fire and admitted to Paradise, he indeed is successful.) meaning, whoever is kept away from the Fire, saved from it and entered into Paradise, will have achieved the ultimate success.  Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,  «مَوْضِعُ سَوْطٍ فِي الْجَنَّةِ خَيْرٌ مِنَ الدُّنْيَا وَمَا فِيهَا، اقْرَأُوا إِنْ شِئْتُمْ »  (A place in Paradise as small as that which is occupied by a whip is better than the world and whatever is on its surface. Read if you will),  فَمَن زُحْزِحَ عَنِ النَّارِ وَأُدْخِلَ الْجَنَّةَ فَقَدْ فَازَ  (And whoever is removed away from the Fire and admitted to Paradise, he indeed is successful). This was collected in the Two Sahihs, but using another chain of narration and without the addition (the Ayah.) Abu Hatim Ibn Hibban recorded it in his Sahih without the addition as did Al-Hakim in his Mustadrak.  Allah said,  وَما الْحَيَوةُ الدُّنْيَا إِلاَّ مَتَـعُ الْغُرُورِ  (The life of this world is only the enjoyment of deception. ) belittling the value of this life and degrading its importance. This life is short, little and finite, just as Allah said,  بَلْ تُؤْثِرُونَ الْحَيَوةَ الدُّنْيَا - وَالاٌّخِرَةُ خَيْرٌ وَأَبْقَى  (Nay, you prefer the life of this world. Although the Hereafter is better and more lasting.) 87:16,17, and,  وَمَآ أُوتِيتُم مِّن شَىْءٍ فَمَتَـعُ الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا وَزِينَتُهَا وَمَا عِندَ اللَّهِ خَيْرٌ وَأَبْقَى  (And whatever you have been given is an enjoyment of the life of (this) world and its adornment, and that (Hereafter) which is with Allah is better and will remain forever) 28:60. A Hadith states,  «وَاللهِ مَا الدُّنْيَا فِي الْآخِرَةِ إِلَّا كَمَا يَغْمِسُ أَحَدُكُمْ أُصْبُعَهُ فِي الْيَمِّ، فَلْيَنْظُرْ بِمَ تَرْجِعُ إِلَيْه»  (By Allah! This life, compared to the Hereafter, is just as insignificant as when one of you dips his finger in the sea; let him contemplate what his finger will come back with.)  Qatadah commented on Allah's statement,  وَما الْحَيَوةُ الدُّنْيَا إِلاَّ مَتَـعُ الْغُرُورِ  (The life of this world is only the enjoyment of deception.) \"Life is a delight. By Allah, other than Whom there is no deity, it will soon fade away from its people. Therefore, take obedience to Allah from this delight, if you can. Verily, there is no power except from Allah.\" <h2>The Believer is Tested and Hears Grieving Statements from the Enemy</h2> Allah said,  لَتُبْلَوُنَّ فِى أَمْوَلِكُمْ وَأَنفُسِكُمْ  (You shall certainly be tried and tested in your wealth and properties and in yourselves), just as He said in another Ayah,  وَلَنَبْلُوَنَّكُم بِشَيْءٍ مِّنَ الْخَوفْ وَالْجُوعِ وَنَقْصٍ مِّنَ الاٌّمَوَالِ وَالاٌّنفُسِ وَالثَّمَرَتِ  (And certainly, We shall test you with something of fear, hunger, loss of wealth, lives and fruits) 2:155.  Therefore, the believer shall be tested, in his wealth, himself, his offspring and family. The believer shall be tested according to the degree of his faith, and when his faith is stronger, the test is larger.  Allah said to the believers upon their arrival at Al-Madinah, before Badr, while comforting them against the harm they suffered from the People of the Scriptures and the polytheists;  وَإِن تَصْبِرُواْ وَتَتَّقُواْ فَإِنَّ ذلِكَ مِنْ عَزْمِ الاٍّمُورِ  (but if you persevere patiently, and have Taqwa, then verily, that will be a determining factor in all affairs.)  Therefore, Allah commanded the believers to be forgiving, patient and forbearing until He brought His awaited aid.  Al-Bukhari recorded that Usamah bin Zayd said that Allah's Messenger ﷺ rode a donkey with a saddle covered by a velvet sheet and let Usamah ride behind him (on the donkey). The Prophet wanted to visit Sa`d bin `Ubadah in Bani Al-Harith bin Al-Khazraj, and this occurred before the battle of Badr. The Prophet passed by a gathering in which `Abdullah bin Ubayy bin Salul was sitting, before `Abdullah bin Ubayy became Muslim. That gathering was made up of various Muslims as well as Mushriks, who worshipped the idols, and some Jews. `Abdullah bin Rawahah was sitting in that gathering. When the Prophet reached `Abdullah bin Ubayy, the donkey caused some sand to fall on the group. Then, `Abdullah bin Ubayy covered his nose with his robe and said, `Do not fill us with sand.' The Messenger of Allah ﷺ greeted the gathering with Salam, called them to Allah and recited some of the Qur'an to them. `Abdullah bin Ubayy said, `O fellow! No other speech is better than what you said, if it was true! However, do not bother us in our gatherings. Go back to your place and whoever came to you, narrate your stories to him.' `Abdullah bin Rawahah said, `Rather, O Messenger of Allah! Attend our gatherings for we like that.' The Muslims, Mushriks and Jews then cursed each other, and they almost fought with each other. The Prophet tried to calm them down, until they finally settled. The Prophet rode his donkey and went to Sa`d bin `Ubadah, saying, `O Sa`d! Have you heard what Abu Hubbab said (meaning `Abdullah bin Ubayy) He said such and such things. ' Sa`d said, `O Messenger of Allah! Forgive and pardon him. By Allah, Who sent down the Book to you, Allah brought us the truth that you came with at a time when the people of this city almost appointed him king. When Allah changed all that with the truth that He gave you, he choked on it, and this is the reason behind the behavior you saw from him.' The Messenger of Allah ﷺ forgave him. Indeed, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and his Companions used to forgive the Mushriks and the People of the Scriptures, just as Allah commanded them, and they used to tolerate the harm that they suffered. Allah said,  وَلَتَسْمَعُنَّ مِنَ الَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ الْكِتَـبَ مِن قَبْلِكُمْ وَمِنَ الَّذِينَ أَشْرَكُواْ أَذًى كَثِيراً  (and you shall certainly hear much that will grieve you from those who received the Scripture before you (Jews and Christians) and from those who ascribe partners to Allah;) 3:186, and,  وَدَّ كَثِيرٌ مِّنْ أَهْلِ الْكِتَـبِ لَوْ يَرُدُّونَكُم مِن بَعْدِ إِيمَـنِكُمْ كُفَّارًا حَسَدًا مِّنْ عِنْدِ أَنْفُسِهِمْ مِّن بَعْدِ مَا تَبَيَّنَ لَهُمُ الْحَقُّ فَاعْفُواْ وَاصْفَحُواْ حَتَّى يَأْتِىَ اللَّهُ بِأَمْرِهِ  (Many of the People of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) wish that they could turn you away as disbelievers after you have believed, out of envy from their own selves, even after the truth has become manifest unto them. But forgive and overlook, till Allah brings His command) 2:109.  The Prophet used to implement the pardon that Allah commanded him until He gave His command (to fight the disbelievers). When the Messenger fought at Badr, and Allah killed, by his hand, the leaders of the disbelievers from Quraysh, `Abdullah bin Ubayy bin Salul and the Mushriks and idol worshippers who were with him said, `This matter has prevailed,' and they gave their pledge to the Prophet and became Muslims.\"  Therefore, every person who stands for truth, enjoins righteousness and forbids evil, will be harmed in some manner. In such cases, there is no cure better than being patient in Allah's cause, trusting in Him and returning to Him.  وَإِذْ أَخَذَ اللَّهُ مِيثَـقَ الَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ الْكِتَـبَ لَتُبَيِّنُنَّهُ لِلنَّاسِ وَلاَ تَكْتُمُونَهُ فَنَبَذُوهُ وَرَآءَ ظُهُورِهِمْ وَاشْتَرَوْاْ بِهِ ثَمَناً قَلِيلاً فَبِئْسَ مَا يَشْتَرُونَ "
