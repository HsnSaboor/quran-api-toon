tafsir[13]{c,v,t}:
  27,64,"﴾إِنَّ بَطْشَ رَبِّكَ لَشَدِيدٌ - إِنَّهُ هُوَ يُبْدِىءُ وَيُعِيدُ ﴿ (Verily, the punishment of your Lord is severe and painful. Verily, He it is Who begins and repeats.) (85:12-13) ﴾وَهُوَ الَّذِى يَبْدَأُ الْخَلْقَ ثُمَّ يُعِيدُهُ وَهُوَ أَهْوَنُ عَلَيْهِ﴿ (And He it is Who originates the creation, then He will repeat it; and this is easier for Him.) (30:27) ﴾وَمَن يَرْزُقُكُم مِّنَ السَّمَآءِ والاٌّرْضِ﴿ (and Who provides for you from heaven and earth) with the rain He sends down from the sky causing the blessings of the earth to grow, as He says elsewhere: ﴾وَالسَّمَآءِ ذَاتِ الرَّجْعِ - وَالاّرْضِ ذَاتِ الصَّدْعِ ﴿ (By the sky which gives rain, again and again. And the earth which splits.) (86:11-12) ﴾يَعْلَمُ مَا يَلْجُ فِى الاٌّرْضِ وَمَا يَخْرُجُ مِنْهَا وَمَا يَنزِلُ مِنَ السَّمَآءِ وَمَا يَعْرُجُ فِيهَا﴿ (He knows that which goes into the earth and that which comes forth from it, and that which descends from the heaven and that which ascends to it) (34:2). Allah, may He be blessed and exalted, sends down water from the sky as a blessing, and causes it to penetrate the earth, and then come forth as springs. After that, by means of the water He brings forth all kinds of crops, fruits and flowers, in all their different forms and colors. ﴾كُلُواْ وَارْعَوْا أَنْعَـمَكُمْ إِنَّ فِى ذلِكَ لأيَـتٍ لاٌّوْلِى النُّهَى ﴿ (Eat and pasture your cattle; verily, in this are signs for men of understanding) (20:54). Allah says: ﴾أَإِلَـهٌ مَّعَ اللَّهِ﴿ (Is there any god with Allah) meaning, who did this Or, according to another interpretation: after this (who could be worth worship) ﴾قُلْ هَاتُواْ بُرْهَـنَكُمْ إِن كُنتُمْ صَـدِقِينَ﴿ (Say: \"Bring forth your proofs, if you are truthful.\") Produce the evidence of that. But it is known that they have no proof or evidence, as Allah says: ﴾وَمَن يَدْعُ مَعَ اللَّهِ إِلَـهَا ءَاخَرَ لاَ بُرْهَانَ لَهُ بِهِ فَإِنَّمَا حِسَابُهُ عِندَ رَبِّهِ إِنَّهُ لاَ يُفْلِحُ الْكَـفِرُونَ ﴿ (And whoever invokes besides Allah, any other god, of whom he has no proof; then his reckoning is only with his Lord. Surely, the disbelievers will not be successful.) (23:117) "

  27,66,"<h2>The One Who knows the Unseen is Allah</h2> Allah commands His Messenger to inform all of creation that no one among the dwellers of heaven and earth knows the Unseen, except Allah.  إِلاَّ اللَّهُ  (except Allah) This is an absolute exception, meaning that no one knows this besides Allah, He is alone in that regard, having no partner in that knowledge. This is like the Ayat:  وَعِندَهُ مَفَاتِحُ الْغَيْبِ لاَ يَعْلَمُهَآ إِلاَّ هُوَ  (And with Him are the keys of the Unseen, none knows them but He) (6:59).  إِنَّ اللَّهَ عِندَهُ عِلْمُ السَّاعَةِ وَيُنَزِّلُ الْغَيْثَ  (Verily, Allah, with Him is the knowledge of the Hour, He sends down the rain) (31:34). until the end of the Surah. And there are many Ayat which mention similar things.  وَمَا يَشْعُرُونَ أَيَّانَ يُبْعَثُونَ  (nor can they perceive when they shall be resurrected.) That is, the created beings who dwell in the heavens and on earth do not know when the Hour will occur, as Allah says:  ثَقُلَتْ فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ لاَ تَأْتِيكُمْ إِلاَّ بَغْتَةً  (Heavy is its burden through the heavens and the earth. It shall not come upon you except all of a sudden) (7: 187). meaning, it is a grave matter for the dwellers of heaven and earth.  بَلِ ادَرَكَ عِلْمُهُمْ فِى الاٌّخِرَةِ بَلْ هُمْ فِى شَكٍّ مِّنْهَا  (Nay, their knowledge will perceive that in the Hereafter. Nay, they are in doubt about it.) means their knowledge and amazement stops short of knowing its time. Other scholars read this with the meaning \"their knowledge is all the same with regard to that,\" which reflects the meaning of the Hadith in Sahih Muslim which states that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to Jibril, when the latter asked him when the Hour would come: s  «مَا الْمَسْؤُولُ عَنْهَا بِأَعْلَمَ مِنَ السَّائِل»  (The one who is being asked about it does not know any more than the one who is asking.) In other words, they were both equal in the fact that their knowledge did not extend that far.  بَلْ هُمْ فِى شَكٍّ مِّنْهَا  (Nay, they are in doubt about it.) This refers to the disbelievers in general as Allah says elsewhere:  وَعُرِضُواْ عَلَى رَبِّكَ صَفَا لَّقَدْ جِئْتُمُونَا كَمَا خَلَقْنَـكُمْ أَوَّلَ مَرَّةٍ بَلْ زَعَمْتُمْ أَلَّن نَّجْعَلَ لَكُمْ مَّوْعِدًا  (And they will be set before your Lord in rows, (and Allah will say:) \"Now indeed, you have come to Us as We created you the first time. Nay, but you thought that We had appointed no meeting for you (with Us). \") (18:48) i.e., the disbelievers among you. By the same token, Allah says here:  بَلْ هُمْ فِى شَكٍّ مِّنْهَا  (Nay, they are in doubt about it.) meaning, they doubt that it will come to pass.  بَلْ هُم مِّنْهَا عَمُونَ  (Nay, they are in complete blindness about it.) They are blind and completely ignorant about it.  وَقَالَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ أَءِذَا كُنَّا تُرَاباً وَءَابَآؤُنَآ أَءِنَّا لَمُخْرَجُونَ - لَقَدْ وُعِدْنَا هَـذَا نَحْنُ وَءَابَآؤُنَا مِن قَبْلُ إِنْ هَـذَآ إِلاَّ أَسَـطِيرُ الاٌّوَّلِينَ "

  27,70,"<h2>Scepticism about the Resurrection and Its Refutation</h2> Allah tells us about the idolators who deny the Resurrection, considering it extremely unlikely that bodies will be re-created after they have become bones and dust. Then He says: ﴾لَقَدْ وُعِدْنَا هَـذَا نَحْنُ وَءَابَآؤُنَا مِن قَبْلُ﴿ (Indeed we were promised this -- we and our forefathers before,) meaning, `we and our forefathers have been hearing this for a long time, but in reality, we have never seen it happen.' ﴾إِنْ هَـذَآ إِلاَّ أَسَـطِيرُ الاٌّوَّلِينَ﴿ (verily, these are nothing but tales of ancients.) the promises that bodies will be restored are ﴾إِلاَّ أَسَـطِيرُ الاٌّوَّلِينَ﴿ (nothing but tales of ancients.) meaning that they were taken by the people who came before us from books which were handed down from one to the other, but they have no basis in reality. Responding to their thoughts of disbelief and their belief that there would be no Resurrection, Allah said, ﴾قُلْ﴿ (Say) `O Muhammad, to these people,' ﴾سِيرُواْ فِى الاٌّرْضِ فَاْنظُرُواْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَـقِبَةُ الْمُجْرِمِينَ﴿ (Travel in the land and see how has been the end of the criminals. ) meaning, those who denied the Messengers and their message of the Resurrection and other matters. See how the punishment and vengeance of Allah struck them and how Allah saved from among them the noble Messengers and the believers who followed them. This will be an indication of the truth of the Message brought by the Messengers. Then, to comfort the Prophet , Allah says: ﴾وَلاَ تَحْزَنْ عَلَيْهِمْ﴿ (And grieve you not over them,) meaning, `but do not feel sorry for them or kill yourself with regret for them,' ﴾وَلاَ تَكُن فِى ضَيْقٍ مِّمَّا يَمْكُرُونَ﴿ (nor be straitened because of what they plot.) means, `because they plot against you and reject what you have brought, for Allah will help and support you, and cause your religion to prevail over those who oppose you and stubbornly resist you in the east and in the west.'

  27,75,"﴾وَيَقُولُونَ مَتَى هَـذَا الْوَعْدُ إِن كُنتُمْ صَـدِقِينَ ﴿ (And they say: \"When (will) this promise (be fulfilled), if you are truthful\")  Allah said, responding to them: ﴾قُلْ﴿ (Say) `O Muhammad,' ﴾عَسَى أَن يَكُونَ رَدِفَ لَكُم بَعْضُ الَّذِى تَسْتَعْجِلُونَ﴿ (Perhaps that which you wish to hasten on, may be close behind you.) Ibn `Abbas said, \"That which you wish to hasten on has come close to you, or some of it has come close.\" This was also the view of Mujahid, Ad-Dahhak, `Ata Al-Khurasani, Qatadah and As-Suddi. This is also what is meant in the Ayat: ﴾وَيَقُولُونَ مَتَى هُوَ قُلْ عَسَى أَن يَكُونَ قَرِيبًا﴿ (And they say: \"When will that be\" Say: \"Perhaps it is near!\") (17:51) ﴾يَسْتَعْجِلُونَكَ بِالْعَذَابِ وَإِنَّ جَهَنَّمَ لَمُحِيطَةٌ بِالْكَـفِرِينَ ﴿ (They ask you to hasten on the torment. And verily, Hell, of a surety, will encompass the disbelievers) (29:54). ﴾عَسَى أَن يَكُونَ رَدِفَ لَكُم﴿ (may be close behind you.) means, it is being hastened for you. This was reported from Mujahid. Then Allah says: ﴾وَإِنَّ رَبَّكَ لَذُو فَضْلٍ عَلَى النَّاسِ﴿ (Verily, your Lord is full of grace for mankind,) meaning, He abundantly bestows His blessings on them even though they wrong themselves, yet despite that they do not give thanks for those blessings, except for a few of them. ﴾وَإِنَّ رَبَّكَ لَيَعْلَمُ مَا تُكِنُّ صُدُورُهُمْ وَمَا يُعْلِنُونَ ﴿ (And verily, your Lord knows what their breasts conceal and what they reveal.) means, He knows what is hidden in their hearts just as He knows what is easily visible. ﴾سَوَآءٌ مِّنْكُمْ مَّنْ أَسَرَّ الْقَوْلَ وَمَنْ جَهَرَ بِهِ﴿ (It is the same (to Him) whether any of you conceals his speech or declares it openly) (13:10), ﴾يَعْلَمُ السِّرَّ وَأَخْفَى﴿ (He knows the secret and that which is yet more hidden) (20: 7), ﴾أَلا حِينَ يَسْتَغْشُونَ ثِيَابَهُمْ يَعْلَمُ مَا يُسِرُّونَ وَمَا يُعْلِنُونَ﴿ (Surely, even when they cover themselves with their garments, He knows what they conceal and what they reveal) (11:5). Then Allah tells us that He is the Knower of the unseen in the heavens and on earth, and that He is the Knower of the unseen and the seen, i.e., that which is unseen by His servants and that which they can see. And Allah says: ﴾وَمَا مِنْ غَآئِبَةٍ﴿ (and there is nothing hidden) Ibn `Abbas said, \"This means, there is nothing ﴾فِى السَّمَآءِ وَالاٌّرْضِ إِلاَّ فِى كِتَـبٍ مُّبِينٍ﴿ (in the heaven and the earth but it is in a Clear Book.) This is like the Ayah, ﴾أَلَمْ تَعْلَمْ أَنَّ اللَّهَ يَعْلَمُ مَا فِى السَّمَآءِ وَالاٌّرْضِ إِنَّ ذلِكَ فِى كِتَـبٍ إِنَّ ذلِكَ عَلَى اللَّهِ يَسِيرٌ ﴿ (Know you not that Allah knows all that is in the heaven and on the earth Verily, it is (all) in the Book. Verily, that is easy for Allah.) (22:70) "
