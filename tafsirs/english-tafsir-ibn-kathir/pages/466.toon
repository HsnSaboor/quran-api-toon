  39,70,"<h2>The Blast of the Trumpet, the Judgement and the Recompense</h2> Allah tells us about the terrors of the Day of Judgement, with its mighty signs and terrifying upheaval.  وَنُفِخَ فِى الصُّورِ فَصَعِقَ مَن فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَمَن فِى الاٌّرْضِ إِلاَّ مَن شَآءَ اللَّهُ  (And the Trumpet will be blown and all who are in the heavens and all who are on the earth will swoon away, except him whom Allah wills.) This will be the second trumpet-blast, which will cause people to die. By this trumpet-blast, everyone who is alive in the heavens and on earth will be caused to die, except for him whom Allah wills. Then the souls of the remaining creatures will be taken, until the last one to die will be the Angel of Death, and there will be left only the Ever Living, Eternal One, Who was there in the beginning and will be at the end, forever. He will say three times,  لِّمَنِ الْمُلْكُ الْيَوْمَ  (\"Whose is the kingdom this day\"), then He will answer Himself:  لِلَّهِ الْوَحِدِ الْقَهَّارِ  (\"It is Allah's, the One, the Irresistible!\") (40:16). `I am the One existing Alone, I subjugated all things and I decreed that all things must come to an end.' Then the first one to be brought back to life will be Israfil, and Allah will command him to sound the Trumpet again. This will be the third trumpet-blast, the trumpet-blast of Resurrection. Allah says:  ثُمَّ نُفِخَ فِيهِ أُخْرَى فَإِذَا هُمْ قِيَامٌ يَنظُرُونَ  (Then it will be blown another time, and behold they will be standing, looking on) means, after they have been bones and dust, they will come alive, looking at the terrors of the Day of Resurrection. This is like the Ayat:  فَإِنَّمَا هِىَ زَجْرَةٌ وَحِدَةٌ فَإِذَا هُمْبِالسَّاهِرَةِ  (But it will be only a single Zajrah, when behold, they find themselves alive.) (79:13-14)  يَوْمَ يَدْعُوكُمْ فَتَسْتَجِيبُونَ بِحَمْدِهِ وَتَظُنُّونَ إِن لَّبِثْتُمْ إِلاَّ قَلِيلاً  (On the Day when He will call you, and you will respond with His praise, and you will think that you have stayed (in this world) but a little while!) (17:52), and  وَمِنْ ءَايَـتِهِ أَن تَقُومَ السَّمَآءُ وَالاٌّرْضُ بِأَمْرِهِ ثُمَّ إِذَا دَعَاكُمْ دَعْوَةً مِّنَ الاٌّرْضِ إِذَآ أَنتُمْ تَخْرُجُونَ  (And among His signs is that the heaven and the earth stand by His command. Then afterwards when He will call you by a single call, behold, you will come out from the earth.) (30:25) Imam Ahmad recorded that a man said to `Abdullah bin `Amr, may Allah be pleased with him, \"You say that the Hour will come at such and such time.\" He said, \"I thought that I would not narrate to you anymore. All that I said was that after a little while you would see something of great importance.\" `Abdullah bin `Amr, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:  «يَخْرُجُ الدَّجَّالُ فِي أُمَّتِي فَيَمْكُثُ فِيهِمْ أَرْبَعِينَ  (The Dajjal will emerge in my Ummah and he will stay among them for forty. ) I do not know whether he said forty days or forty months or forty years or forty nights.  «فَيَبْعَثُ اللهُ تَعَالَى عِيسَى ابْنَ مَرْيَمَ عَلَيْهِ الصَّلَاةُ وَالسَّلَامُ، كَأَنَّهُ عُرْوَةُ بْنُ مَسْعُودٍ الثَّقَفِيُّ، فَيَظْهَرُ فَيُهْلِكُهُ اللهُ تَعَالَى، ثُمَّ يَلْبَثُ النَّاسُ بَعْدَهُ سِنِينَ سَبْعًا، لَيْسَ بَيْنَ اثْنَيْنِ عَدَاوَةٌ، ثُمَّ يُرْسِلُ اللهُ تَعَالَى رِيحًا بَارِدَةً مِنْ قِبَلِ الشَّامِ، فَلَا يَبْقَى أَحَدٌ فِي قَلْبِهِ مِثْقَالُ ذَرَّةٍ مِنْ إِيمَانٍ إِلَّا قَبَضَتْهُ، حَتْى لَوْ أَنَّ أَحَدَهُمْ كَانَ فِي كَبِدِ جَبَلٍ لَدَخَلَتْ عَلَيْه»  (Then Allah will send `Isa bin Maryam, peace be upon him, who resembles `Urwah bin Mas`ud Ath-Thaqafi, and he will prevail. Allah will destroy him (the Dajjal), then after that mankind will live for seven years with no enmity between any two people. Then Allah will send a cool wind from the direction of Ash-Sham, which will take the soul of every person who has even a speck of faith in his heart; even if one of them were to be inside the heart of a mountain, it would enter upon him.)\" He said, \"I heard it from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ:  «وَيَبْقَى شِرَارُ النَّاسِ فِي خِفَّةِ الطَّيْرِ وَأَحْلَامِ السِّبَاع، لَا يَعْرِفُونَ مَعْرُوفًا، وَلَا يُنْكِرُونَ مُنْكَرًا، قال: فَيَتَمَثَّلُ لَهُمُ الشَّيْطَانُ فَيَقُولُ: أَلَا تَسْتَجِيبُونَ؟ فَيَأْمُرُهُمْ بِعِبَادَةِ الْأَوْثَانِ فَيَعْبُدُونَهَا، وَهُمْ فِي ذَلِكَ دَارَّةٌ أَرْزَاقُهُمْ، حَسَنٌ عَيْشُهُمْ، ثُمَّ يُنْفَخُ فِي الصُّورِ، فَلَا يَسْمَعُهُ أَحَدٌ إِلَّا أَصْغَى لَهُ، وَأَوَّلُ مَنْ يَسْمَعُهُ، رَجُلٌ يَلُوطُ حَوْضَهُ فَيَصْعَقُ، ثُمَّ لَا يَبْقَى أَحَدٌ إِلَّا صَعِقَ، ثُمَّ يُرْسِلُ اللهُ تَعَالَى أَوْ يُنْزِلُ اللهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ مَطَرًا كَأَنَّهُ الطَّلُّ أَوِ الظِّلُّ شك نعمان فَتَنْبُتُ مِنْهُ أَجْسَادُ النَّاسِ، ثُمَّ يُنْفَخُ فِيهِ أُخْرَى فَإِذَا هُمْ قِيَامٌ يَنْظُرُونَ، ثُمَّ يُقَالُ: أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ هَلُمُّوا إِلى رَبِّكُمْ  وَقِفُوهُمْ إِنَّهُمْ مَّسْئُولُونَ  (There will be left the most evil of people, as light as birds and with the hard hearts of wild predators. They will not recognize any good or denounce any evil. Then Shaytan will appear to them and say, \"Will you not obey me\" Then he will command them to worship idols and they will worship them. At that time they will have ample provision and a good standard of living. Then the Trumpet will be blown, and no one will hear it but he will tilt his head to listen. The first one to hear it will be a man who is filling his water trough, and he will die when he hears it. Then there will be no one left who has not died. Then Allah will send) -- or -- send down (rain like drizzle) -- or -- shade -- An-Nu`man one of the narrators was not sure of its wording (from which the bodies of the people will grow. Then the Trumpet will be blown once more, and they will be standing, looking on. Then it will be said, \"O mankind, come to your Lord, (But stop them, verily, they are to be questioned) (37:24). Then it will be said,  «أَخْرِجُوا بَعْثَ النَّارِ، قال: فيُقَالُ: كَمْ؟ فَيُقَالُ: مِنْ كُلِّ أَلْفٍ تِسْعَمِائَةٍ وَتِسْعَةً وَتِسْعِينَ، فَيَوْمَئِذٍ يُبْعَثُ الْوِلْدَانُ شِيبًا، وَيَوْمَئِذٍ يُكْشَفُ عَنْ سَاق»  (\"Send forth the people of Hell.\" It will be said, \"How many\" It will said, \"From every thousand, nine hundred and ninety- nine.\" On that Day, children will be resurrected gray-haired, and on that Day the Shin will be laid bare.)\" This was recorded by Muslim in his Sahih. Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, said that the Prophet said:  «مَا بَيْنَ النَّفْخَتَيْنِ أَرْبَعُون»  (Between the two blasts, there will be only forty. ) They said, \"O Abu Hurayrah, forty days\" He, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"I do not know.\" They said, \"Forty years\" He said, \"I do not know.\" They said, \"Forty months\" He said, \"I do not know.\"  «وَيَبْلَى كُلُّ شَيْءٍ مِنَ الْإِنْسَانِ إِلَّا عَجْبَ ذَنَبِهِ فِيهِ يُرَكَّبُ الْخَلْق»  (Every part of a man will disinegrate apart from the root of his backbone, and out of that he will be created anew.)  وَأَشْرَقَتِ الاٌّرْضُ بِنُورِ رَبِّهَا  (And the earth will shine with the light of its Lord,) means, it will shine brightly on the Day of Resurrection when the Truth (Allah), may He be glorified and exalted, manifests Himself to His creation, to pass judgement.  وَوُضِعَ الْكِتَـبُ  (and the Book will be presented). Qatadah said, \"The Book of deeds.\"  وَجِـىءَ بِالنَّبِيِّيْنَ  (and the Prophets will be brought forward,) Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"They will bear witness against the nations, testifying that they conveyed the Message of Allah to them.\"  وَالشُّهَدَآءُ  (and the witnesses) means, witnesses from among the angels who record the deeds of all, good and evil alike.  وَقُضِىَ بَيْنَهُمْ بِالْحَقِّ  (and it will be judged between them with truth, ) means, with justice.  وَهُمْ لاَ يُظْلَمُونَ  (and they will not be wronged.) Allah says:  وَنَضَعُ الْمَوَزِينَ الْقِسْطَ لِيَوْمِ الْقِيَـمَةِ فَلاَ تُظْلَمُ نَفْسٌ شَيْئاً وَإِن كَانَ مِثْقَالَ حَبَّةٍ مِّنْ خَرْدَلٍ أَتَيْنَا بِهَا وَكَفَى بِنَا حَـسِبِينَ  (And We shall setup Balances of justice on the Day of Resurrection, then none will be dealt with unjustly in anything. And if there be the weight of a mustard seed, We will bring it. And Sufficient are We to take account.) (21:47)  إِنَّ اللَّهَ لاَ يَظْلِمُ مِثْقَالَ ذَرَّةٍ وَإِن تَكُ حَسَنَةً يُضَـعِفْهَا وَيُؤْتِ مِن لَّدُنْهُ أَجْراً عَظِيماً  (Surely, Allah wrongs not even of the weight of a speck of dust, but if there is any good (done), He doubles it, and gives from Him a great reward.) (4:40) Allah says:  وَوُفِّيَتْ كُلُّ نَفْسٍ مَّا عَمِلَتْ  (And each person will be paid in full of what he did;) meaning, of good and evil.  وَهُوَ أَعْلَمُ بِمَا يَفْعَلُونَ  (and He is Best Aware of what they do).

  39,72,"<h2>How the Disbelievers will be driven to Hell</h2> Allah tells us how the doomed disbeliever will be driven to Hell by force, with threats and warnings. This is like the Ayah:  ﴾يَوْمَ يُدَعُّونَ إِلَى نَارِ جَهَنَّمَ دَعًّا ﴿ (The Day when they will be pushed down by force to the fire of Hell, with a horrible, forceful pushing.) (52:13) swhich means, they will be pushed and forced towards it, and they will be extremely thirsty, as Allah says:  ﴾يَوْمَ نَحْشُرُ الْمُتَّقِينَ إِلَى الرَّحْمَـنِ وَفْداً - وَنَسُوقُ الْمُجْرِمِينَ إِلَى جَهَنَّمَ وِرْداً ﴿ (The Day We shall gather those who have Taqwa unto the Most Gracious, like a delegation. And We shall drive the criminals to Hell, in a thirsty state.) (19:85-86) When they are in that state, they will be blind, dumb and deaf, and some of them will be walking on their faces:  ﴾وَنَحْشُرُهُمْ يَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ عَلَى وُجُوهِهِمْ عُمْيًا وَبُكْمًا وَصُمًّا مَّأْوَاهُمْ جَهَنَّمُ كُلَّمَا خَبَتْ زِدْنَاهُمْ سَعِيرًا﴿ (and We shall gather them together on the Day of Resurrection on their faces, blind, dumb and deaf; their abode will be Hell; whenever it abates, We shall increase for them the fierceness of the Fire) (17:97).  ﴾حَتَّى إِذَا جَآءُوهَا فُتِحَتْ أَبْوَبُهَا﴿ (till when they reach it, the gates thereof will be opened.) means, as soon as they arrive, the gates will be opened quickly, in order to hasten on their punishment. Then the keepers of Hell, who are stern angels, severe and strong, will say to them by way of rebuking and reprimanding:  ﴾أَلَمْ يَأْتِكُمْ رُسُلٌ مِّنكُمْ﴿ (Did not the Messengers come to you from yourselves,) meaning, `of your own kind, so that you could have spoken to them and learned from them,'  ﴾يَتْلُونَ عَلَيْكُمْ ءَايَـتِ رَبِّكُمْ﴿ (reciting to you the Ayat of your Lord,) means, `establishing proof against you that what they brought to you was true,'  ﴾وَيُنذِرُونَكُمْ لِقَآءَ يَوْمِكُمْ هَـذَا﴿ (and warning you of the meeting of this Day of yours) means, `warning you of the evil of this Day.' The disbeliever will say to them:  ﴾بَلَى﴿ (Yes,) meaning, `they did come to us and warn us and establish proof and evidence against us,'  ﴾وَلَـكِنْ حَقَّتْ كَلِمَةُ الْعَذَابِ عَلَى الْكَـفِرِينَ﴿ (but the Word of torment has been justified against the disbelievers!) means, `but we rejected them and went against them, because we were already doomed, as it was decreed that we would be, because we had turned away from the truth towards falsehood.' This is like the Ayat:  ﴾كُلَّمَا أُلْقِىَ فِيهَا فَوْجٌ سَأَلَهُمْ خَزَنَتُهَآ أَلَمْ يَأْتِكُمْ نَذِيرٌ﴿ (Every time a group is cast therein, its keeper will ask: \"Did no warner come to you\" They will say: \"Yes, indeed a warner came to us, but we denied him and said: `Allah never revealed anything; you are only in great error.\"' And they will say: \"Had we but listened or used our intelligence, we would not have been among the dwellers of the blazing Fire!\") (67:9-10) which means, they will feel regret and will blame themselves.  ﴾فَاعْتَرَفُواْ بِذَنبِهِمْ فَسُحْقًا لاًّصْحَـبِ السَّعِيرِ ﴿ (Then they will confess their sin. So, away with the dwellers of the blazing Fire!) (67:11) means, they are lost and doomed.  ﴾قِيلَ ادْخُلُواْ أَبْوَبَ جَهَنَّمَ خَـلِدِينَ فِيهَا﴿ (It will be said (to them): \"Enter you the gates of Hell, to abide therein...\") means everyone who sees them and the situation they are in, will testify that they deserve the punishment. These words are not attributed to any specific person, but they are said as an indication that the entire universe will bear witness that they deserve what they are suffering, in accordance with the judgement of the Most Just, the All-Knowing. Allah says:  ﴾قِيلَ ادْخُلُواْ أَبْوَبَ جَهَنَّمَ خَـلِدِينَ فِيهَا﴿ (It will be said (to them): \"Enter you the gates of Hell, to abide therein...\") meaning, `to stay there forever; you will never leave or depart.'  ﴾فَبِئْسَ مَثْوَى الْمُتَكَـبِّرِينَ﴿ (And (indeed) what an evil abode of the arrogant!) means, `what an evil destiny and what an evil place to stay, because of your arrogance in this world and your refusal to follow the truth; this is what has led you to this, what an evil state and what an evil final destination!'  "

  39,74,"<h2>The Believers will be taken to Paradise Here</h2> Allah tells us about the blessed believers, who will be taken to Paradise in groups, one group after another, starting with the best of them: those who are closest to Allah, then the most righteous, then the next best and the next best. Each group will be with others like them, Prophets with Prophets, the true believers with their peers, the martyrs with their counterparts, the scholars with their colleagues, every group composed of people of the same kind.  حَتَّى إِذَا جَآءُوهَا  (till when they reach it,) means, when they arrive at the gates of Paradise, after passing over the Sirat, where they will be detained on a bridge between Paradise and Hell, and any injustices that existed between them in this world will be settled until they have all been purified from sin through this trial. Then permission will be granted for them to enter Paradise. It was recorded in the Hadith about the Trumpet that when the believers reach the gates of Paradise, they will consult one another as to who should ask permission for them to enter. They will ask Adam, then Nuh, then Ibrahim, then Musa, then `Isa, then Muhammad (may blessings and peace be upon them all). This is akin to what will happen in the arena of judgement, when they will ask for someone to intercede for them with Allah when He comes to pass judgement. This is to show the noble position of Muhammad ﷺ above the rest of mankind in all situations. In Sahih Muslim, it is reported that Anas, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:  «أَنَا أَوَّلُ شَفِيعٍ فِي الْجَنَّة»  (I will be the first intercessor in Paradise.) According to the wording of Muslim:  «وَأَنَا أَوَّلُ مَنْ يَقْرَعُ بَابَ الْجَنَّة»  (I will be the first one to knock at the gates of Paradise.) Imam Ahmad recorded that Anas bin Malik, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:  «آتِي بَابَ الْجَنَّةِ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ فَأَسْتَفْتِحُ فَيَقُولُ الْخَازِنُ: مَنْ أَنْتَ؟ فَأَقُولُ: مُحَمَّدٌ قَالَ: فَيَقُولُ: بِكَ أُمِرْتُ أَنْ لَا أَفْتَحَ لِأَحَدٍ قَبْلَك»  (I will come to the gate of Paradise on the Day of Resurrection and will ask for it to be opened. The gatekeeper will say, \"Who are you\" I will say \"Muhammad.\" He will say, \"I was told about you and that I was not to open the gate for anyone before you.\")\" It was also recorded by Muslim. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:  «أَوَّلُ زُمْرَةٍ تَلِجُ الْجَنَّـةَ، صُوَرُهُمْ عَلَى صُورَةِ الْقَمَرِ لَيْلَةَ الْبَدْرِ، لَا يَبْصُقُونَ فِيهَا، وَلَا يَمْتَخِطُونَ فِيهَا، وَلَا يَتَغَوَّطُونَ فِيهَا، آنِيَتُهُمْ وَأَمْشَاطُهُمُ الذَّهَبُ وَالْفِضَّةُ، وَمَجَامِرُهُمُ الْأَلُوَّةُ وَرَشْحُهُمُ الْمِسْكُ، وَلِكُلِّ وَاحِدٍ مِنْهُمْ زَوْجَتَانِ، يُرَى مُخُّ سَاقِهِمَا مِنْ وَرَاءِ اللَّحْمِ مِنَ الْحُسْنِ، لَا اخْتِلَافَ بَيْنَهُمْ وَلَا تَبَاغُضَ، قُلُوبُهُمْ عَلى قَلْبٍ وَاحِدٍ، يُسَبِّحُونَ اللهَ تَعَالَى بُكْرَةً وَعَشِيًّا»  (The first group to enter Paradise will enter looking like the moon on the night when it is full. They will not spit there, or blow their noses, or defecate. Their vessels and combs will be of gold and silver, their censers will be of aloeswood and their sweat will be musk. Each of them will have two wives, the marrow of whose shin bones will be visible from beneath the skin because of their beauty. There will be no disputes between them and there will be no hatred; their hearts will be as if one heart. They will glorify Allah morning and evening.)\" This was also recorded by Al-Bukhari and Muslim. Al-Hafiz Abu Ya`la recorded that Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:  «أَوَّلُ زُمْرَةٍ يَدْخُلُونَ الْجَنَّةَ عَلى صُورَةِ الْقَمَرِ لَيْلَةَ الْبَدْرِ، وَالَّذِينَ يَلُونَهُمْ عَلى ضَوْءِ أَشَدِّ كَوْكَبٍ دُرِّيَ فِي السَّمَاءِ إِضَاءَةً، لَا يَبُولُونَ، وَلَا يَتَغَوَّطُونَ، وَلَا يَتْفِلُونَ، وَلَا يَمْتَخِطُونَ، أَمْشَاطُهُمُ الذَّهَبُ، وَرَشْحُهُمُ الْمِسْكُ، وَمَجَامِرُهُمُ الْأَلُوَّةُ، وَأَزْوَاجُهُمُ الْحُورُ الْعِينُ، أَخْلَاقُهُمْ عَلى خُلُقِ رَجُلٍ وَاحِدٍ، عَلى صُورَةِ أَبِيهِمْ آدَمَ، سِتُّونَ ذِرَاعًا فِي السَّمَاء»  (The first group to enter Paradise will look like the moon on the night when it is full. They will be followed by a group which looks like the brightest star shining in the sky. They will not urinate or defecate or spit or blow their noses. Their combs will be of gold, their sweat will be musk and their censers will be of aloeswood. Their wives will be Al-Hur Al-`Iyn, and they will all look the same, as if they are one person in the image of their father Adam, sixty cubits tall.)\" They Al-Bukhari and Muslim also produced this from the Hadith of Jabir. It was reported that Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:  «يَدْخُلُ الْجَنَّةَ مِنْ أُمَّتِي زُمْرَةٌ، هُمْ سَبْعُونَ أَلْفًا،تُضِيءُ وُجُوهُهُمْ إِضَاءَةَ الْقَمَرِ لَيْلَةَ الْبَدْر»  (A group of my Ummah, seventy thousand, will enter Paradise with their faces shining like the moon on the night when it is full.) `Ukkashah bin Mihsan stood up and said, `O Messenger of Allah, pray to Allah to make me one of them.' He said,  «اللْهُمَّ اجْعَلْهُ مِنْهُم»  (O Allah, make him one of them.) Then one of the Ansar stood up and said, `O Messenger of Allah, pray to Allah to make me one of them.' He said,  «سَبَقَكَ بِهَا عُكَّاشَة»  (Ukkashah has beaten you to it.)\" This was recorded by (Al-Bukhari and Muslim). This Hadith -- about the seventy thousand who will enter Paradise without being brought to account -- was also recorded by Al-Bukhari and Muslim from Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Jabir bin `Abdullah, `Imran bin Husayn, Ibn Mas`ud, Rifa`ah bin `Arabah Al-Juhani and Umm Qays bint Mihsan -- may Allah be pleased with them all -- and also from Abu Hazim from Sahl bin Sa`d, may Allah be pleased with them, who said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:  «لَيَدْخُلَنَّ الْجَنَّةَ مِنْ أُمَّتِي سَبْعُونَ أَلْفًا أَوْ سَبْعُمِائَةِ أَلْفٍ آخِذٌ بَعْضُهُمْ بِبَعْضٍ، حَتْى يَدْخُلَ أَوَّلُهُمْ وَآخِرُهُمُ الْجَنَّةَ، وُجُوهُهُمْ عَلى صُورَةِ الْقَمَرِ لَيْلَةَ الْبَدْر»  (Seventy thousand or seven hundred thousand of my Ummah will surely enter Paradise, holding on to one another, such that the first and last of them will enter Paradise together, with their faces looking like the moon on the night when it is full.)\"  حَتَّى إِذَا جَآءُوهَا وَفُتِحَتْ أَبْوَبُهَا وَقَالَ لَهُمْ خَزَنَتُهَا سَلَـمٌ عَلَيْكُـمْ طِبْتُمْ فَادْخُلُوهَا خَـلِدِينَ  (till when they reach it, and its gates will be opened and its keepers will say: \"Salam `Alaykum (peace be upon you)! You have done well, so enter here to abide therein forever.\") This is a conditional sentence that is not complete. What it implies is that when they come to the gates of Paradise the gates will be opened for them as a sign of honor, and the angelic gatekeepers will meet them with glad tidings, greetings of peace and praise. Unlike the gatekeepers of Hell who will meet the disbelievers with rebuke and reprimand, the believers will be filled with happiness and joy, each according to his degree of luxury and delights. What happens after this is not mentioned; it is left for the imagination to think of its dearest wishes and be filled with hope. It is known from the Sahih Hadiths that Paradise has eight gates. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:  «مَنْ أَنْفَقَ زَوْجَيْنِ مِنْ مَالِهِ فِي سَبِيلِ اللهِ تَعَالَى دُعِيَ مِنْ أَبْوَابِ الْجَنَّةِ، وَلِلْجَنَّةِ أَبْوَابٌ، فَمَنْ كَانَ مِنْ أَهْلِ الصَّلَاةِ دُعِيَ مِنْ بَابِ الصَّلَاةِ، وَمَنْ كَانَ مِنْ أَهْلِ الصَّدَقَةِ دُعِيَ مِنْ بَابِ الصَّدَقَةِ، وَمَنْ كَانَ مِنْ أَهْلِ الْجِهَادِ دُعِيَ مِنْ بَابِ الْجِهَادِ، وَمَنْ كَانَ مِنْ أَهْلِ الصِّيَامِ دُعِيَ مِنْ بَابِ الرَّيَّان»  (Whoever spends a pair of something from his wealth for the sake of Allah, will be called from the gates of Paradise. Paradise has (several) gates. Whoever is among the people of prayer, will be called from the gate of Prayer; whoever is among the people of charity, will be called from the gate of Charity; whoever is among the people of Jihad, will be called from the gate of Jihad; whoever is among the people of fasting, will be called from the Gate of Ar-Rayyan.)\" Abu Bakr said, `O Messenger of Allah, it does not matter from which gate one is called, but will anyone be called from all of them' He said,  «نَعَمْ، وَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونَ مِنْهُم»  (Yes, and I hope that you will be one of them.)\" Something similar was also recorded by Al-Bukhari and Muslim. It was reported from Sahl bin Sa`d, may Allah be pleased with him, that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:  «إِنَّ فِي الْجَنَّةِ ثَمَانِيَةَ أَبْوَابٍ، بَابٌ مِنْهَا يُسَمَّى الرَّيَّانَ، لَا يَدْخُلُهُ إِلَّا الصَّائِمُون»  (In Paradise there are eight gates; one of them is called Ar-Rayyan, and no one will enter it except those who fast.)\" In Sahih Muslim, it is recorded that `Umar bin Al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:  «مَا مِنْكُمْ مِنْ أَحَدٍ يَتَوَضَّأُ فَيُبْلِغُ أَوْ فَيُسْبِغُ الْوُضُوءَ، ثُمَّ يَقُولُ: أَشْهَدُ أَنْ لَا إِلهَ إِلَّا اللهُ وَأَنَّ مُحَمَّدًا عَبْدُهُ وَرَسُولُهُ، إِلَّا فُتِحَتْ لَهُ أَبْوَابُ الْجَنَّةِ الثَّمَانِيَةُ، يَدْخُلُ مِنْ أَيِّهَا شَاء»  (There is no one among you who performs Wudu' and does it well, or -- amply --, then he says: \"I testify that there is none worthy of worship except Allah and that Muhammad is His servant and Messenger, \" but the eight gates of Paradise will be opened for him and he will enter through whichever one he wishes.)\" <h2>The Width of the Gates of Paradise</h2> We ask Allah to make us among its people. In the Two Sahihs, it is reported from Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, in the lengthy Hadith about intercession (that the Prophet said):  «فَيَقُولُ اللهُ تَعَالَى: يَا مُحَمَّدُ، أَدْخِلْ مَنْ لَا حِسَابَ عَلَيْهِ مِنْ أُمَّتِكَ مِنَ الْبَابِ الْأَيْمَنِ، وَهُمْ شُرَكَاءُ النَّاسِ فِي الْأَبْوَابِ الأُخَرِ، وَالَّذِي نَفْسُ مُحَمَّدٍ بِيَدِهِ إِنَّ مَا بَيْنَ الْمِصْرَاعَيْنِ مِنْ مَصَارِيعِ الْجَنَّةِ مَا بَيْنَ عِضَادَتَيِ الْبَابِ لَكَمَا بَيْنَ مَكَّةَ وَهَجَرٍ أَوْ هَجَرٍ وَمَكَّةَ وفي رواية مَكَّةَ وَبُصْرَى»  (Allah will say: \"O Muhammad, admit those of your Ummah who are not to be brought to account, through the right-hand gate, and they will be counted among those who will enter from other gates as well.\" By the One in Whose Hand is the soul of Muhammad, the distance between the two gateposts of the gates of Paradise is like the distance between Makkah and Hajar -- or Hajar and Makkah.)\" According to another report: (between Makkah and Busra.) It was recorded in Sahih Muslim from `Utbah bin Ghazwan that (the Prophet ) gave them a speech in which he told them that the distance between the two gateposts of Paradise was the distance of a forty-year journey, but there would come a day when they would be packed with crowds of people. Allah says,  وَقَالَ لَهُمْ خَزَنَتُهَا سَلَـمٌ عَلَيْكُـمْ طِبْتُمْ  (and its keepers will say: \"Salam `Alaykum (peace be upon you)! You have done well,\") meaning, `your deeds and words were good, and your efforts were good, and your reward is good.' The Messenger of Allah ﷺ issued commands during some of his military campaigns that it should be shouted out to the Muslims:  «إِنَّ الْجَنَّةَ لَا يَدْخُلُهَا إِلَّا نَفْسٌ مُسْلِمَةٌ وفي رواية مُؤْمِنَة»  (No one enters Paradise except a Muslim soul) or, according to one report, (A believing soul.)\" Allah says,  فَادْخُلُوهَا خَـلِدِينَ  (so enter here to abide therein forever.) means, to dwell therein, never seeking any change.  وَقَـالُواْ الْحَـمْدُ للَّهِ الَّذِى صَدَقَنَا وَعْدَهُ  (And they will say: \"All the praises and thanks be to Allah Who has fulfilled His promise to us...\") means, when the believers see the great reward and splendors, blessing and grand generosity, they will say,  الْحَـمْدُ للَّهِ الَّذِى صَدَقَنَا وَعْدَهُ  (All the praises and thanks be to Allah Who has fulfilled His promise to us) meaning, `the promise which He made to us through His Messengers who called us to this in the world.'  رَبَّنَا وَءَاتِنَا مَا وَعَدتَّنَا عَلَى رُسُلِكَ وَلاَ تُخْزِنَا يَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ إِنَّكَ لاَ تُخْلِفُ الْمِيعَادَ  (Our Lord! Grant us what You promised unto us through Your Messengers and disgrace us not on the Day of Resurrection, for You never break (Your) promise)(3:194),  وَقَالُواْ الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ الَّذِى هَدَانَا لِهَـذَا وَمَا كُنَّا لِنَهْتَدِىَ لَوْلا أَنْ هَدَانَا اللَّهُ لَقَدْ جَآءَتْ رُسُلُ رَبِّنَا بِالْحَقِّ  (and they will say: \"All the praises and thanks be to Allah, Who has guided us to this, and never could we have found guidance, were it not that Allah had guided us! Indeed, the Messengers of our Lord came with the truth.\") (7:43), and  وَقَالُواْ الْحَمْدُ للَّهِ الَّذِى أَذْهَبَ عَنَّا الْحَزَنَ إِنَّ رَبَّنَا لَغَفُورٌ شَكُورٌ - الَّذِى أَحَلَّنَا دَارَ الْمُقَامَةِ مِن فَضْلِهِ لاَ يَمَسُّنَا فِيهَا نَصَبٌ وَلاَ يَمَسُّنَا فِيهَا لُغُوبٌ  (And they will say: \"All the praises and thanks be to Allah Who has removed from us (all) grief. Verily, our Lord is indeed Oft-Forgiving, Most Ready to appreciate (good deeds). Who, out of His grace, has lodged us in a home that will last forever, where toil will touch us not nor weariness will touch us.\") (35:34-35)  وَأَوْرَثَنَا الاٌّرْضَ نَتَبَوَّأُ مِنَ الْجَنَّةِ حَيْثُ نَشَآءُ فَنِعْمَ أَجْرُ الْعَـمِلِينَ  (and has made us inherit (this) land. We can dwell in Paradise where we will; how excellent a reward for the (pious) workers!) Abu Al-Aliyah, Abu Salih, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ibn Zayd said, \"This means the land of Paradise.\" This is like the Ayah:  وَلَقَدْ كَتَبْنَا فِى الزَّبُورِ مِن بَعْدِ الذِّكْرِ أَنَّ الاٌّرْضَ يَرِثُهَا عِبَادِىَ الصَّـلِحُونَ  (And indeed We have written in Az-Zabur after Adh-Dhikr that My righteous servants shall inherit the land. ) (21:105) they will say:  نَتَبَوَّأُ مِنَ الْجَنَّةِ حَيْثُ نَشَآءُ  (We can dwell in Paradise where we will) meaning, `wherever we want, we can settle; how excellent a reward for our efforts.' In the Two Sahihs, it was reported in the story of the Mi`raj which was narrated by Anas bin Malik, may Allah be pleased with him, that the Prophet said:  «أُدْخِلْتُ الْجَنَّةَ، فَإِذَا فِيهَا جَنَابِذُ اللُّؤْلُؤِ، وَإِذَا تُرَابُهَا الْمِسْك»  (I was admitted into Paradise where I saw that its domes were pearls and its soil was musk.)\" "
