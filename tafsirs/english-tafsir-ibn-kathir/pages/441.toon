  36,17,"<h2>The Story of the Dwellers of the Town and Their Messengers, a Lesson that Those Who belied Their Messengers were Destroyed </h2> Allah says, `O Muhammad, tell your people who disbelieve in you,' ﴾مَّثَلاً أَصْحَـبَ القَرْيَةِ إِذْ جَآءَهَا الْمُرْسَلُونَ﴿ (a similitude; the Dwellers of the Town, when there came Messengers to them.) In the reports that he transmitted from Ibn `Abbas, Ka`b Al-Ahbar and Wahb bin Munabbih - Ibn Ishaq reported that it was the city of Antioch, in which there was a king called Antiochus the son of Antiochus the son of Antiochus, who used to worship idols. Allah sent to him three Messengers, whose names were Sadiq, Saduq and Shalum, and he disbelieved in them. It was also narrated from Buraydah bin Al-Husayb, `Ikrimah, Qatadah and Az-Zuhri that it was Antioch. Some of the Imams were not sure that it was Antioch, as we shall see below after telling the rest of the story, if Allah wills. ﴾إِذْ أَرْسَلْنَآ إِلَيْهِمُ اثْنَيْنِ فَكَذَّبُوهُمَا﴿ (When We sent to them two Messengers, they denied them both;) means, they hastened to disbelieve in them. ﴾فَعَزَّزْنَا بِثَالِثٍ﴿ (so We reinforced them with a third,) means, `We supported and strengthened them with a third Messenger. ' Ibn Jurayj narrated from Wahb bin Sulayman, from Shu`ayb Al-Jaba'i, \"The names of the first two Messengers were Sham`un and Yuhanna, and the name of the third was Bulus, and the city was Antioch (Antakiyah). ﴾فَقَالُواْ﴿ (and they said) means, to the people of that city, ﴾إِنَّآ إِلَيْكُمْ مُّرْسَلُونَ﴿ (Verily, we have been sent to you as Messengers.) meaning, `from your Lord Who created you and Who commands you to worship Him Alone with no partners or associates.' This was the view of Abu Al-`Aliyah. Qatadah bin Di`amah claimed that they were messengers of the Messiah, peace be upon him, sent to the people of Antioch. ﴾قَالُواْ مَآ أَنتُمْ إِلاَّ بَشَرٌ مِّثْلُنَا﴿ (They said: \"You are only human beings like ourselves...\") means, `so how could you receive revelation when you are human beings and we are human beings, so why do we not receive revelation like you If you are Messengers, you should be angels.' This is like what many of the nations said who disbelieved, as Allah has told us in the Ayah: c ﴾ذَلِكَ بِأَنَّهُ كَانَت تَّأْتِيهِمْ رُسُلُهُم بِالْبَيِّنَـتِ فَقَالُواْ أَبَشَرٌ يَهْدُونَنَا﴿ (That was because there came to them their Messengers with clear proofs, but they said: \"Shall mere men guide us\") (64: 6) meaning that they were amazed by that and they denied it. And Allah says: ﴾قَالُواْ إِنْ أَنتُمْ إِلاَّ بَشَرٌ مِّثْلُنَا تُرِيدُونَ أَن تَصُدُّونَا عَمَّا كَانَ يَعْبُدُ ءَابَآؤُنَا فَأْتُونَا بِسُلْطَـنٍ مُّبِينٍ﴿ (They said: \"You are no more than human beings like us! You wish to turn us away from what our fathers used to worship. Then bring us a clear authority.\") (14:10). And Allah tells us that they said: ﴾وَلَئِنْ أَطَعْتُمْ بَشَراً مِّثْلَكُمْ إِنَّكُمْ إِذاً لَّخَـسِرُونَ ﴿ (\"If you were to obey a human being like yourselves, then verily, you indeed would be losers.\") (23:34). And Allah says: ﴾وَمَا مَنَعَ النَّاسَ أَن يُؤْمِنُواْ إِذْ جَآءَهُمُ الْهُدَى إِلاَّ أَن قَالُواْ أَبَعَثَ اللَّهُ بَشَرًا رَّسُولاً ﴿ (And nothing prevented men from believing when the guidance came to them, except that they said: \"Has Allah sent a man as (His) Messenger\") (17:94). These people said: ﴾قَالُواْ مَآ أَنتُمْ إِلاَّ بَشَرٌ مِّثْلُنَا وَمَآ أَنَزلَ الرَّحْمَـنُ مِن شَىْءٍ إِنْ أَنتُمْ إِلاَّ تَكْذِبُونَ - قَالُواْ رَبُّنَا يَعْلَمُ إِنَّآ إِلَيْكُمْ لَمُرْسَلُونَ ﴿ (You are only human beings like ourselves, and the Most Gracious has revealed nothing. You are only telling lies.\" The Messengers said: \"Our Lord knows that we have been sent as Messengers to you.\") This means that the three Messengers answered them saying: \"Allah knows that we are His Messengers to you. If we were lying, He would have taken the utmost vengeance against us, but He will cause us to prevail and will make us victorious against you, and you will come to know whose will be the happy end in the Hereafter.\" This is like the Ayah: ﴾قُلْ كَفَى بِاللَّهِ بَيْنِى وَبَيْنَكُمْ شَهِيداً يَعْلَمُ مَا فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ وَالَّذِينَ ءامَنُواْ بِالْبَـطِلِ وَكَفَرُواْ بِاللَّهِ أُوْلَـئِكَ هُمُ الْخَـسِرُونَ ﴿ (Say: \"Sufficient is Allah for a witness between me and you. He knows what is in the heavens and on earth.\" And those who believe in falsehood, and disbelieve in Allah, it is they who are the losers.) (29:52) ﴾وَمَا عَلَيْنَآ إِلاَّ الْبَلَـغُ الْمُبِينُ ﴿ (And our duty is only to convey plainly.) means, `all we have to do is to convey to you the Message with which we have been sent; if you obey, then happiness will be yours in this world and the Hereafter, and if you do not respond, you will soon know the consequences of that.' And Allah knows best. ﴾قَالُواْ إِنَّا تَطَيَّرْنَا بِكُمْ لَئِن لَّمْ تَنتَهُواْ لَنَرْجُمَنَّكُمْ وَلَيَمَسَّنَّكُمْ مِّنَّا عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ ﴿"
  36,18,"3724"
  36,19,"﴾إِنَّا تَطَيَّرْنَا بِكُمْ﴿ (For us, we see an evil omen from you;) meaning, `we do not see in your faces any sign of good for our lives.' Qatadah said, \"They were saying, `if something bad befalls us, it will be because of you.\"' Mujahid said, \"They were saying: People like you never enter a town, but its people are punished.\" ﴾لَئِن لَّمْ تَنتَهُواْ لَنَرْجُمَنَّكُمْ﴿ (if you cease not, we will surely stone you,) Qatadah said, \"By throwing stones at you.\" ﴾وَلَيَمَسَّنَّكُمْ مِّنَّا عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ﴿ (and a painful torment will touch you from us.) means, a severe punishment. Their Messengers said to them: ﴾طَـئِرُكُم مَّعَكُمْ﴿ (Your evil omens be with you!) meaning, `they are thrown back at you.' This is like the Ayah where Allah describes the people of Fir`awn: ﴾فَإِذَا جَآءَتْهُمُ الْحَسَنَةُ قَالُواْ لَنَا هَـذِهِ وَإِن تُصِبْهُمْ سَيِّئَةٌ يَطَّيَّرُواْ بِمُوسَى وَمَن مَّعَهُ أَلاَ إِنَّمَا طَائِرُهُمْ عِندَ اللَّهِ﴿ (But whenever good came to them, they said: \"Ours is this.\" And if evil afflicted them, they ascribed it to evil omens connected with Musa and those with him. Be informed! Verily, their evil omens are with Allah) (7:131). And the people of Salih said: ﴾اطَّيَّرْنَا بِكَ وَبِمَن مَّعَكَ قَالَ طَائِرُكُمْ عِندَ اللَّهِ﴿ (\"We augur ill omen from you and those with you.\" He said: \"Your ill omen is with Allah.\") (27:47) And Allah said: ﴾وَإِن تُصِبْهُمْ حَسَنَةٌ يَقُولُواْ هَـذِهِ مِنْ عِندِ اللَّهِ وَإِن تُصِبْهُمْ سَيِّئَةٌ يَقُولُواْ هَـذِهِ مِنْ عِندِكَ قُلْ كُلٌّ مِّنْ عِندِ اللَّهِ فَمَا لِهَـؤُلاءِ الْقَوْمِ لاَ يَكَادُونَ يَفْقَهُونَ حَدِيثاً﴿ (And if some good reaches them, they say, \"This is from Allah,\" but if some evil befalls them, they say, \"This is from you.\" Say: \"All things are from Allah,\" so what is wrong with these people that they fail to understand any word) (4:78) ﴾أَءِن ذُكِّرْتُم بَلْ أَنتُمْ قَوْمٌ مُّسْرِفُونَ﴿ ((Do you call it \"evil omen\") because you are admonished Nay, but you are a people mischievous.) means, `because of us, because we admonished you and told you to worship Allah Alone and with all sincerity, and in return you said what you said and threatened us. Nay, but you are a mischievous people.' Qatadah said, \"This means, `Because we reminded you about Allah, you saw an evil omen in us. Nay, but you are a mischievous people'. \" "

  36,25,"﴾قَالَ يقَوْمِ اتَّبِعُواْ الْمُرْسَلِينَ﴿ (He said: \"O my people! Obey the Messengers.\") -- he urged his people to follow the Messengers who had come to them. ﴾اتَّبِعُواْ مَن لاَّ يَسْـَلُكُمْ أَجْراً﴿ (Obey those who ask no wages of you,) means, `for the Message which they convey to you, and they are rightly-guided in what they are calling you to, the worship of Allah Alone with no partner or associate.' ﴾وَمَا لِىَ لاَ أَعْبُدُ الَّذِى فَطَرَنِى﴿ (And why should I not worship Him Who has created me) means, `and what is there to stop me from sincerely worshipping the One Who has created me, and worshipping Him Alone, with no partner or associate' ﴾وَإِلَيْهِ تُرْجَعُونَ﴿ (and to Whom you shall be returned.) means, `on the Day of Resurrection, when He will requite you for your deeds: if they are good then you will be rewarded and if they are evil then you will be punished.' ﴾أَءَتَّخِذُ مِن دُونِهِ ءَالِهَةً﴿ (Shall I take besides Him gods) This is a rhetorical question intended to rebuke and chastise. ﴾إِن يُرِدْنِ الرَّحْمَـنُ بِضُرٍّ لاَّ تُغْنِ عَنِّى شَفَـعَتُهُمْ شَيْئاً وَلاَ يُنقِذُونَ﴿ (If the Most Gracious intends me any harm, their intercession will be of no use for me whatsoever, nor can they save me.) means, `these gods whom you worship instead of Him possess no power whatsoever, if Allah wills me some harm,' ﴾فَلاَ كَـشِفَ لَهُ إِلاَّ هُوَ﴿ (none can remove it but He) (6:17). `These idols can neither cause any harm nor bring any benefit, and they cannot save me from the predicament I am in.' ﴾إِنِّى إِذاً لَّفِى ضَلَـلٍ مُّبِينٍ ﴿ (Then verily, I should be in plain error.) means, `if I were to take them as gods instead of Allah.' ﴾إِنِّى ءَامَنتُ بِرَبِّكُمْ فَاسْمَعُونِ ﴿ (Verily, I have believed in your Lord, so listen to me!) Ibn Ishaq said, quoting from what had reached him from Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Ka`b and Wahb, \"He said to his people: ﴾إِنِّى ءَامَنتُ بِرَبِّكُمْ﴿ (`Verily, I have believed in your Lord) in Whom you have disbelieved, ﴾فَاسْمَعُونِ﴿ (so listen to me!)' means, listen to what I say.\" Or it may be that he was addressing the Messengers when he said: ﴾إِنِّى ءَامَنتُ بِرَبِّكُمْ﴿ (Verily, I have believed in your Lord,) meaning, `Who has sent you,' ﴾فَاسْمَعُونِ﴿ (so listen to me!) meaning, `bear witness to that before Him.' This was narrated by Ibn Jarir, who said, \"And others said that this was addressed to the Messengers, and he said to them: `Listen to what I say and bear witness to what I say before my Lord, that I have believed in your Lord and have followed you.' This interpretation is more apparent, and Allah knows best. Ibn Ishaq said, quoting from what had reached him from Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Ka`b and Wahb, `When he said that, they turned on him as one, and killed him at once, and he had no one to protect him from that.\"' Qatadah said, \"They started to stone him while he was saying, `O Allah, guide my people for they do not know, and they kept stoning him until he died a violent death, and he was still praying for them.' May Allah have mercy on him.\" "
