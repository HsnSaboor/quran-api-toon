  7,89,"<h2>Allah describes the way the disbelievers answered His ProphetShu` ayb and those who believed in him, by threatening them withexpulsion from their village, or with forceful reversion to thedisbeliever's religion.</h2> The chiefs spoke the words mentioned here to the Messenger Shu`ayb, but intended it for those who followed his religion too. The statement,  ﴾أَوَلَوْ كُنَّا كَـرِهِينَ﴿ (\"Even though we hate it\"), means, would you force us to do that, even though we hate what you are calling us to Certainly if we revert to your religion and accept your ways, we will have uttered a tremendous lie against Allah by calling partners as rivals to Him,  ﴾وَمَا يَكُونُ لَنَآ أَن نَّعُودَ فِيهَآ إِلاَ أَن يَشَآءَ اللَّهُ رَبُّنَا﴿ (And it is not for us to return to it unless Allah, our Lord, should will.) This part of the Ayah refers all matters to Allah's will, and certainly, He has perfect knowledge of all matters and His observation encompasses all things,  ﴾عَلَى اللَّهِ تَوَكَّلْنَا﴿ (In Allah (Alone) we put our trust. ), concerning all our affairs, what we practice of them and what we ignore,  ﴾رَبَّنَا افْتَحْ بَيْنَنَا وَبَيْنَ قَوْمِنَا بِالْحَقِّ﴿ (Our Lord! Judge between us and our people in truth) judge between us and our people and give us victory over them,  ﴾وَأَنتَ خَيْرُ الْفَـتِحِينَ﴿ (for You are the best of those who give judgment) and You are the Most Just Who never wrongs any in His judgment.

  7,92,"﴾لَئِنِ اتَّبَعْتُمْ شُعَيْبًا إِنَّكُمْ إِذاً لَّخَـسِرُونَ﴿ (\"If you follow Shu`ayb, be sure then you will be the losers!\") Allah answered them,  ﴾فَأَخَذَتْهُمُ الرَّجْفَةُ فَأَصْبَحُواْ فِي دَارِهِمْ جَـثِمِينَ ﴿ (So the earthquake seized them and they lay (dead), prostrate in their homes) Allah said that the earthquake shook them, as punishment for threatening to expel Shu`ayb and his followers. Allah mentioned their end again in Suah Hud,  ﴾وَلَمَّا جَآءَ أَمْرُنَا نَجَّيْنَا شُعَيْبًا وَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ مَعَهُ بِرَحْمَةٍ مِّنَّا وَأَخَذَتِ الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ الصَّيْحَةُ فَأَصْبَحُواْ فِى دِيَـرِهِمْ جَـثِمِينَ ﴿ (And when Our commandment came, We saved Shu`ayb and those who believed with him by a mercy from Us. And the Sayhah (loud cry) seized the wrongdoers, and they lay (dead) prostrate in their homes.) 11:94 This Ayah mentions the Sayhah (cry) that struck them after they mocked Shu`ayb, saying,  ﴾أَصَلَوَتُكَ تَأْمُرُكَ﴿ (Does your Salah (prayer) command you...) so it was befitting to mention here the cry that made them silence. In Surat Ash-Shu`ara', Allah said,  ﴾فَكَذَّبُوهُ فَأَخَذَهُمْ عَذَابُ يَوْمِ الظُّلَّةِ إِنَّهُ كَانَ عَذَابَ يَوْمٍ عَظِيمٍ ﴿ (But they belied him, so the torment of the Day of Shadow (a gloomy cloud) seized them. Indeed that was the torment of a Great Day) 26:189 because they challenged Shu`ayb,  ﴾فَأَسْقِطْ عَلَيْنَا كِسَفاً مِّنَ السَّمَآءِ﴿ (\"So cause a piece of the heaven to fall on us, if you are of the truthful!\") 26:187. Therefore, Allah stated that each of these forms of punishment struck them on the Day of the Shadow. First,  ﴾فَأَخَذَهُمْ عَذَابُ يَوْمِ الظُّلَّةِ﴿ (So the torment of the Day of Shadow (a gloomy cloud) seized them) 26:189 when a gloomy cloud came over them (containing) fire, flames and a tremendous light. Next, a cry from the sky descended on them and a tremor shook them from beneath. Consequently, their souls were captured, their lives were taken and their bodies became idle,  ﴾فَأَصْبَحُواْ فِي دَارِهِمْ جَـثِمِينَ﴿ (and they lay (dead), prostrate in their homes). Allah said next,  ﴾كَأَن لَّمْ يَغْنَوْاْ فِيهَآ﴿ (They became as if they had never dwelt there) meaning, after the torment seized them, it looked as if they never dwelled in the land from which they wanted to expel their Messenger Shu`ayb and his followers. Here, Allah refuted their earlier statement,  ﴾الَّذِينَ كَذَّبُواْ شُعَيْبًا كَانُواْ هُمُ الْخَـسِرِينَ﴿ (Those who belied Shu`ayb, they were the losers.)  "
  7,93,"﴾يَقَوْمِ لَقَدْ أَبْلَغْتُكُمْ رِسَـلَـتِ رَبِّى وَنَصَحْتُ لَكُمْ﴿ (\"O my people! I have indeed conveyed my Lord's Messages unto you and I have given you good advice.\") Shu`ayb said, I have conveyed to you what I was sent with, so I will not feel any sorrow for you since you disbelieved in what I brought you,  ﴾فَكَيْفَ ءَاسَى عَلَى قَوْمٍ كَـفِرِينَ﴿ (\"Then how can I grieve over pepple who are disbelievers\")  "

  7,95,"<h2>Afflictions that struck Earlier Nations</h2> Allah mentions the Ba'sa' and Darra' that struck the earlier nations to whom He sent Prophets. Ba'sa', refers to the physical sicknesses and ailments that they suffered, while Darra', refers to the poverty and humiliation that they experienced,  ﴾لَعَلَّهُمْ يَضَّرَّعُونَ﴿ (so that they might humble themselves) supplicate, humble themselves and invoke Allah, that He might remove the afflictions that they suffered from. This Ayah indicates that Allah sent down severe afflictions to them so that they might invoke Him, but they did not do what He ordered them. Therefore, He changed the affliction into prosperity to test them,  ﴾ثُمَّ بَدَّلْنَا مَكَانَ السَّيِّئَةِ الْحَسَنَةَ﴿ (Then We changed the evil for the good,) Therefore, Allah changed the hardship into prosperity, disease and sickness into health and well-being, and poverty into richness in provision, so that they might be thankful to Allah for this, but they did none of that. Allah's statement,  ﴾حَتَّى عَفَواْ﴿ (until they `Afaw) refers to increase in numbers, wealth and offspring. Allah said next,  ﴾وَّقَالُواْ قَدْ مَسَّ ءَابَاءَنَا الضَّرَّآءُ وَالسَّرَّآءُ فَأَخَذْنَـهُمْ بَغْتَةً وَهُمْ لاَ يَشْعُرُونَ﴿ (. . and they said: \"Our fathers were touched with evil and with good.\" So We seized them all of a sudden while they were unaware.) He tested them with this (afflictions) and that (ease and abundance) so that they may humble themselves and repent to Him. However, they failed both tests, for neither this nor that compelled them to change their ways. They said, \"We suffered Ba'sa' and Darra', but prosperity came afterwards, just as like our forefathers in earlier times.\" \"Therefore,\" they said, \"it is a cycle where we sometimes suffer a hardship and at other times, we enjoy a bounty.\" However, they did not comprehend Allah's wisdom, nor the fact that He is testing them in both cases. To the contrary, the believers are grateful to Allah in good times and practice patience in hard times. In the Sahih, there is a Hadith that says;  ﴾«عَجَبًا لِلْمُؤْمِنِ لَا يَقْضِي اللهُ لَهُ قَضَاءً إِلَّا كَانَ خَيْرًا لَهُ، وَإِنْ أَصَابَتْهُ ضَرَّاءُ صَبَرَ فَكَانَ خَيْرًا لَهُ، وَإِنْ أَصَابَتْهُ سَرَّاءُ شَكَرَ فَكَانَ خَيْرًا لَه»﴿ (The matter of the believer is amazing, for nothing that Allah decrees for him, but it is better for him. If a Darra' (harm) strikes him, he is patient, and this is better for him, if he is given Sarra' (prosperity), he thanks (Allah) for it and this is better for him.) The believer, therefore, is aware of the test behind the afflictions whether it may be prosperity or adversity that Allah sends to him, as well as the blessings. Similarly, in another Hadith,  ﴾«لَايَزَالُ الْبَلَاءُ بِالْمُؤْمِنِ حَتَّى يَخْرُجَ نَقِيًّا مِنْ ذُنُوبِهِ،وَالْمُنَافِق مِثْله كَمَثَلِ الْحِمَارِ لَا يَدْرِي فِيمَ رَبَطَهُ أَهْلُهُ وَلَا فِيمَ أَرْسَلُوه»﴿ (The believer will continue to be tested by afflictions until he ends up pure from sin. And the parable of the hypocrite is that of a donkey, it does not know why its owners tied it or released it.) Allah said next,  ﴾فَأَخَذْنَـهُمْ بَغْتَةً وَهُمْ لاَ يَشْعُرُونَ﴿ (So We seized them all of a sudden while they were unaware.) meaning, We struck them with punishment all of a sudden, while they were unaware. A Hadith describes sudden death,  ﴾«مَوْتُ الْفَجْأَةِ رَحْمَةٌ لِلْمُؤْمِنِ وَأَخْذَةُ أَسَفٍ لِلْكَافِر»﴿ (Sudden death is a mercy for the believer, but a sorrowful punishment for the disbeliever.)
