tafsir[7]{c,v,t}:
  8,46,"<h2>Manners of War</h2> Allah instructs His faithful servants in the manners of fighting and methods of courage when meeting the enemy in battle,  يَـأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ إِذَا لَقِيتُمْ فِئَةً فَاثْبُتُواْ  (O you who believe! When you meet (an enemy) force, take a firm stand against them) In the Two Sahihs, it is recorded that `Abdullah bin Abi Awfa said that during one battle, Allah's Messenger ﷺ waited until the sun declined, then stood among the people and said,  «يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ لَا تَتَمَنَّوْا لِقَاءَ الْعَدُوِّ، واسْأَلُوا اللهَ الْعَافِيَةَ فَإِذَا لَقِيتُمُوهُمْ فَاصْبِرُوا وَاعْلَمُوا أَنَّ الْجَنَّةَ تَحْتَ ظِلَالِ السُّيُوف»  (O people! Do not wish to face the enemy (in a battle) and ask Allah to save you (from calamities). But if you should face the enemy, then be patient and let it be known to you that Paradise is under the shadows of the swords.)  He then stood and said,  «اللَّهُمَّ مُنْزِلَ الْكِتَابِ، وَمُجْرِي السَّحَابِ، وَهَازِمَ الْأَحْزَابِ، اهْزِمْهُمْ وَانْصُرْنَا عَلَيْهِم»  (O Allah! Revealer of the (Holy) Book, Mover of the clouds, and Defeater of the Confederates, defeat them and grant us victory over them.) <h2>The Command for Endurance when the Enemy Engaging</h2> Allah commands endurance upon meeting the enemy in battle and ordains patience while fighting them. Muslims are not allowed to run or shy away, or show cowardice in battle. They are commanded to remember Allah while in that condition and never neglect His remembrance. They should rather invoke Him for support, trust in Him and seek victory over their enemies from Him. They are required to obey Allah and His Messenger in such circumstances adhering to what He commanded them, and abstaining from what He forbade them. They are required to avoid disputing with each other, for this might lead to their defeat and failure,  وَتَذْهَبَ رِيحُكُمْ  (lest your strength departs), so that your strength, endurance and courage do not depart from you,  وَاصْبِرُواْ إِنَّ اللَّهَ مَعَ الصَّـبِرِينَ  (and be patient. Surely, Allah is with the patients.)  In their courage, and obedience to Allah and His Messenger, the Companions reached a level never seen before by any nation or generation before them, or any nation that will ever come. Through the blessing of the Messenger ﷺ and their obedience to what he commanded, the Companions were able to open the hearts, as well as, the various eastern and western parts of the world in a rather short time. This occurred even though they were few, compared to the armies of the various nations at that time. For example, the Romans, Persians, Turks, Slavs, Berbers, Ethiopians, Sudanese tribes, the Copts and the rest of the Children of Adam. They defeated all of these nations, until Allah's Word became the highest and His religion became dominant above all religions. The Islamic state spread over the eastern and western parts of the world in less than thirty years. May Allah grant them His pleasure, as well as, be pleased with them all, and may He gather us among them, for He is the Most Generous, and Giving. "

  8,49,"<h2>The Idolators leave Makkah, heading for Badr</h2> After Allah commanded the believers to fight in His cause sincerely and to be mindful of Him, He commanded not to imitate the idolators, who went out of their homes  بَطَراً  (boastfully) to suppress the truth,  وَرِئَآءَ النَّاسِ  (and to be seen of men), boasting arrogantly with people. When Abu Jahl was told that the caravan escaped safely, so they should return to Makkah, he commented, \"No, by Allah! We will not go back until we proceed to the well of Badr, slaughter camels, drink alcohol and female singers sing to us. This way, the Arabs will always talk about our stance and what we did on that day.\" However, all of this came back to haunt Abu Jahl, because when they proceeded to the well of Badr, they brought themselves to death; and in the aftermath of Badr, they were thrown in the well of Badr, dead, disgraced, humiliated, despised and miserable in an everlasting, eternal torment. This is why Allah said here,  وَاللَّهُ بِمَا يَعْمَلُونَ مُحِيطٌ  (and Allah is Muhit (encompassing and thoroughly comprehending) all that they do.) He knows how and what they came for, and this is why He made them taste the worst punishment. Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and As-Suddi commented on Allah's statement,  وَلاَ تَكُونُواْ كَالَّذِينَ خَرَجُواْ مِن دِيَـرِهِم بَطَراً وَرِئَآءَ النَّاسِ  (And be not like those who come out of their homes boastfully and to be seen of men,) \"They were the idolators who fought against the Messenger of Allah ﷺ at Badr.\" Muhammad bin Ka`b said, \"When the Quraysh left Makkah towards Badr, they brought female singers and drums along. Allah revealed this verse,  وَلاَ تَكُونُواْ كَالَّذِينَ خَرَجُواْ مِن دِيَـرِهِم بَطَراً وَرِئَآءَ النَّاسِ وَيَصُدُّونَ عَن سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ وَاللَّهُ بِمَا يَعْمَلُونَ مُحِيطٌ  (And be not like those who come out of their homes boastfully and to be seen of men, and hinder (men) from the path of Allah; and Allah is Muhit (encompassing and thoroughly comprehending) all that they do.) <h2>Shaytan makes Evil seem fair and deceives the Idolators</h2> Allah said next,  وَإِذْ زَيَّنَ لَهُمُ الشَّيْطَـنُ أَعْمَـلَهُمْ وَقَالَ لاَ غَالِبَ لَكُمُ الْيَوْمَ مِنَ النَّاسِ وَإِنِّي جَارٌ لَّكُمْ  (And (remember) when Shaytan made their (evil) deeds seem fair to them and said, \"No one of mankind can overcome you today and verily, I am your neighbor.\")  Shaytan, may Allah curse him, made the idolators' purpose for marching seem fair to them. He made them think that no other people could defeat them that day. He also ruled out the possibility that their enemies, the tribe of Bani Bakr, would attack Makkah, saying, \"I am your neighbor.\" Shaytan appeared to them in the shape of Suraqah bin Malik bin Ju`shum, the chief of Bani Mudlij, so that, as Allah described them,  يَعِدُهُمْ وَيُمَنِّيهِمْ وَمَا يَعِدُهُمْ الشَّيْطَـنُ إِلاَّ غُرُوراً  (He Shaytan makes promises to them, and arouses in them false desires; and Shaytan's promises are nothing but deceptions)4:120.  Ibn Jurayj said that Ibn `Abbas commented on this Ayah, (8:48) \"On the day of Badr, Shaytan, as well as, his flag holder and soldiers, accompanied the idolators. He whispered to the hearts of the idolators, `None can defeat you today! I am your neighbor.' When they met the Muslims and Shaytan witnessed the angels coming to their aid,  نَكَصَ عَلَى عَقِبَيْهِ  (he ran away), he went away in flight while proclaiming,  إِنِّي أَرَى مَا لاَ تَرَوْنَ  (Verily, I see what you see not.)\"  `Ali bin Abi Talhah said, that Ibn `Abbas said about this Ayah,  لاَ غَالِبَ لَكُمُ الْيَوْمَ مِنَ النَّاسِ وَإِنِّي جَارٌ لَّكُمْ  (\"No one of mankind can overcome you today and verily, I am your neighbor')  \"Shaytan, as well as, his devil army and flag holders, came on the day of Badr in the shape of a Suraqah bin Malik bin Ju`shum, man from Bani Mudlij, Shaytan said to idolators, `None will defeat you this day, and I will help you.' When the two armies stood face to face, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ took a handful of sand and threw it at the faces of the idolators, causing them to retreat. Jibril, peace be upon him, came towards Shaytan, but when Shaytan, while holding the hand of a Mushrik man, saw him, he withdrew his hand and ran away with his soldiers. That man asked him, `O Suraqah! You claimed that you are our neighbor' He said,  إِنِّي أَرَى مَا لاَ تَرَوْنَ إِنِّي أَخَافُ اللَّهَ وَاللَّهُ شَدِيدُ الْعِقَابِ  (Verily, I see what you see not. Verily, I fear Allah for Allah is severe in punishment)  Shaytan said this when he saw the angels.\" <h2>The Position of the Hypocrites in Badr</h2> Allah said next,  إِذْ يَقُولُ الْمُنَـفِقُونَ وَالَّذِينَ فِي قُلُوبِهِم مَّرَضٌ غَرَّ هَـؤُلاءِ دِينُهُمْ  (When the hypocrites and those in whose hearts was a disease (of disbelief) said: \"These people (Muslims) are deceived by their religion.\")  `Ali bin Abi Talhah said that Ibn `Abbas commented, \"When the two armies drew closer to each other, Allah made the Muslims look few in the eyes of the idolators and the idolators look few in the eyes of the Muslims. The idolators said,  غَرَّ هَـؤُلاءِ دِينُهُمْ  (These people (Muslims) are deceived by their religion.) because they thought that Muslims were so few. They believed, without doubt, that they would defeat the Muslims. Allah said,  وَمَن يَتَوَكَّلْ عَلَى اللَّهِ فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ عَزِيزٌ حَكِيمٌ  (But whoever puts his trust in Allah, then surely, Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise.) Qatadah commented, \"They saw a group of believers who came in defense of Allah's religion. We were informed that when he saw Muhammad and his Companions, Abu Jahl said, `By Allah! After this day, they will never worship Allah!' He said this in viciousness and transgression.\" `Amir Ash-Sha`bi said, \"Some people from Makkah were considering embracing Islam, but when they went with the idolators to Badr and saw how few the Muslims were, they said,  غَرَّ هَـؤُلاءِ دِينُهُمْ  (These people (Muslims) are deceived by their religion.)  Allah said next,  وَمَن يَتَوَكَّلْ عَلَى اللَّهِ  (But whoever puts his trust in Allah), and relies on His grace,  فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ عَزِيزٌ  (then surely, Allah is All-Mighty), and verily, those who take His side in the dispute are never overwhelmed, for His side is mighty, powerful and His authority is All-Great,  حَكِيمٌ  (All-Wise) in all His actions, for He places everything in its rightful place, giving victory to those who deserve it and defeat to those who deserve it. "

  8,51,"<h2>The Angels smite the Disbelievers upon capturing Their Souls</h2> Allah says, if you witnessed the angels capturing the souls of the disbelievers, you would witness a tremendous, terrible, momentous and awful matter,  يَضْرِبُونَ وُجُوهَهُمْ وَأَدْبَـرَهُمْ  (they smite their faces and their backs), saying to them,  وَذُوقُواْ عَذَابَ الْحَرِيقِ  (\"Taste the punishment of the blazing Fire.\")  Ibn Jurayj said that Mujahid said that,  وَأَدْبَـرَهُمْ  (and their backs), refers to their back sides, as happened on the day of Badr. Ibn Jurayj also reported from Ibn `Abbas, \"When the idolators faced the Muslims in Badr, the Muslims smote their faces with swords. When they gave flight, the angels smote their rear ends.\"  Although these Ayat are describing Badr, they are general in the case of every disbeliever. This is why Allah did not make His statement here restrictive to the disbelievers at Badr,  وَلَوْ تَرَى إِذْ يَتَوَفَّى الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ الْمَلَـئِكَةُ يَضْرِبُونَ وُجُوهَهُمْ وَأَدْبَـرَهُمْ  (And if you could see when the angels take away the souls of those who disbelieve (at death); they smite their faces and their backs,)  In Surat Al-Qital (or Muhammad chapter 47) there is a similar Ayah, as well as in Surat Al-An`am,  وَلَوْ تَرَى إِذِ الظَّـلِمُونَ فِى غَمَرَاتِ الْمَوْتِ وَالْمَلَـئِكَةُ بَاسِطُواْ أَيْدِيهِمْ أَخْرِجُواْ أَنفُسَكُمُ  (And if you could but see when the wrongdoers are in the agonies of death, while the angels are stretching forth their hands (saying): \"Deliver your souls!\") 6:93  The angels stretch their hands and smite the disbelievers by Allah's command, since their souls refuse to leave their bodies, so they are taken out by force. This occurs when the angels give them the news of torment and Allah's anger. There is a Hadith narrated from Al-Bara' that when the angel of death attends the disbeliever at the time of death, he comes to him in a terrifying and disgusting shape, saying, \"Get out, O wicked soul, to fierce hot wind, boiling water and a shadow of black smoke.\" The disbeliever's soul then scatters throughout his body, but the angels retrieve it, just as a needle is retrieved from wet wool. In this case, veins and nerve cells will be still attached to the soul. Allah states here that angels bring news of the torment of the Fire to the disbelievers. Allah said next,  ذلِكَ بِمَا قَدَّمَتْ أَيْدِيكُمْ  (This is because of that which your hands forwarded.) meaning, this punishment is the recompense of the evil deeds that you have committed in the life of the world. This is your reckoning from Allah for your deeds,  وَأَنَّ اللَّهَ لَيْسَ بِظَلَّـمٍ لِّلْعَبِيدِ  a(And verily, Allah is not unjust to His servants.)  Certainly, Allah does not wrong any of His creatures, for He is the Just, who never puts anything in an inappropriate place. Honored, Glorified, Exalted and Praised be He, the All-Rich, Worthy of all praise. Muslim recorded that Abu Dharr said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said;  «إنَّ اللهَ تَعَالَى يَقُولُ: يَا عِبَادِي إِنِّي حَرَّمْتُ الظُّلْمَ عَلَى نَفْسِي وَجَعَلْتُهُ بَيْنَكُمْ مُحَرَّمًا فَلَا تَظَالَمُوا، يَا عِبَادِي إِنَّمَا هِيَ أَعْمَالُكُمْ أُحْصِيهَا لَكُمْ فَمَنْ وَجَدَ خَيْرًا فَلْيَحْمَدِ اللهَ وَمَنْ وَجَدَ غَيْرَ ذَلِكَ فَلَا يَلُومَنَّ إِلَّا نَفْسَه»  (Allah, the Exalted, said, `O My servants! I have prohibited injustice for Myself, and made it prohibited to you between each other. Therefore, do not commit injustice against each other. O My servants! It is your deeds that I am keeping count of, so whoever found something good, let him praise Allah for it. Whoever found other than that, has only himself to blame.)  This is why Allah said, "
  8,52," Allah says, `The behavior of these rebellious disbelievers against what I sent you with, O Muhammad, is similar to the behavior of earlier disbelieving nations. So We behaved with them according to Our Da'b, that is, Our behavior or custom and way, as We did with them with what We often do and decide concerning their likes, the denying people of Fir`awn and the earlier nations who rejected the Messengers and disbelieved in Our Ayat,'  ﴾فَأَخَذَهُمُ اللَّهُ بِذُنُوبِهِمْ﴿ (so Allah punished them for their sins.)   Because of their sins, Allah destroyed them  ﴾إِنَّ اللَّهَ قَوِىٌّ شَدِيدُ الْعِقَابِ﴿ (Verily, Allah is All-Strong, severe in punishment.)   none can resist Him or escape His grasp.  "
