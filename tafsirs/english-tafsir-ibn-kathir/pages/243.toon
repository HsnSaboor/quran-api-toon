tafsir[6]{c,v,t}:
  12,64,"<h2>Yusuf's Brothers ask Ya`qub's Permission to send Their Brother Binyamin with Them to Egypt</h2> Allah says that when they went back to their father,  ﴾قَالُواْ يأَبَانَا مُنِعَ مِنَّا الْكَيْلُ﴿ (they said: \"O our father! No more measure of grain shall we get...\") `after this time, unless you send our brother Binyamin with us. So send him with us, and we shall get our measure and we shall certainly guard him.' Some scholars read this Ayah in a way that means, `and he shall get his ration.' They said,  ﴾وَإِنَّا لَهُ لَحَـفِظُونَ﴿ (and truly, we will guard him.), `do not fear for his safety, for he will be returned back to you.' This is what they said to Ya`qub about their brother Yusuf,  ﴾أَرْسِلْهُ مَعَنَا غَداً يَرْتَعْ وَيَلْعَبْ وَإِنَّا لَهُ لَحَـفِظُونَ ﴿ (\"Send him with us tomorrow to enjoy himself and play, and verily, we will take care of him.\") 12:12 This is why Prophet Ya`qub said to them,  ﴾هَلْ آمَنُكُمْ عَلَيْهِ إِلاَّ كَمَآ أَمِنتُكُمْ عَلَى أَخِيهِ مِن قَبْلُ﴿ (Can I entrust him to you except as I entrusted his brother Yusuf to you aforetime) He asked them, `Will you do to him except what you did to his brother Yusuf before, when you took him away from me and separated me from him'  ﴾فَاللَّهُ خَيْرٌ حَـفِظًا﴿﴾وَهُوَ أَرْحَمُ الرَحِمِينَ﴿ (But Allah is the Best to guard, and He is the Most Merciful of those who show mercy.) Ya`qub said, `Allah has the most mercy with me among all those who show mercy, He is compassionate with me for my old age, feebleness and eagerness for my son. I invoke Allah to return him to me, and to allow him and I to be together; for surely, He is the Most Merciful of those who show mercy.'  "

  12,66,"<h2>They find Their Money returned to Their Bags</h2> Allah says, when Yusuf's brothers opened their bags, they found their merchandise inside them, for Yusuf had ordered his servants to return it to their bags. When they found their merchandise in their bags,  ﴾قَالُواْ يأَبَانَا مَا نَبْغِى﴿ (They said: \"O our father! What (more) can we desire...\"), what more can we ask for,  ﴾هَـذِهِ بِضَـعَتُنَا رُدَّتْ إِلَيْنَا﴿ (This, our money has been returned to us;) Qatadah commented (that they said), \"What more can we ask for, our merchandise was returned to us and the `Aziz has given us the sufficient load we wanted\" They said next,  ﴾وَنَمِيرُ أَهْلَنَا﴿ (so we shall get (more) food for our family,), `if you send our brother with us the next time we go to buy food for our family,'  ﴾وَنَحْفَظُ أَخَانَا وَنَزْدَادُ كَيْلَ بَعِيرٍ﴿ (and we shall guard our brother and add one more measure of a camel's load.) since Yusuf, peace be upon him, gave each man a camel's load of corn.  ﴾ذلِكَ كَيْلٌ يَسِيرٌ﴿ (This quantity is easy (for the king to give).) They said these words to make their case more appealing, saying that taking their brother with them is worth this gain,  ﴾قَالَ لَنْ أُرْسِلَهُ مَعَكُمْ حَتَّى تُؤْتُونِ مَوْثِقًا مِّنَ اللَّهِ﴿ (He Ya`qub (Jacob) said: \"I will not send him with you until you swear a solemn oath to me in Allah's Name...\"), until you swear by Allah with the strongest oath,  ﴾لَتَأْتُنَّنِى بِهِ إِلاَّ أَن يُحَاطَ بِكُمْ﴿ (that you will bring him back to me unless you are yourselves surrounded (by enemies)), unless you were all overwhelmed and were unable to rescue him,  ﴾فَلَمَّآ ءَاتَوْهُ مَوْثِقَهُمْ﴿ (And when they had sworn their solemn oath), he affirmed it further, saying,  ﴾اللَّهُ عَلَى مَا نَقُولُ وَكِيلٌ﴿ (Allah is the Witness to what we have said.) Ibn Ishaq commented, \"Ya`qub did that because he had no choice but to send them to bring necessary food supplies for their survival. So he sent Binyamin with them.\"  "

  12,68,"<h2>Ya`qub orders His Children to enter Egypt from Different Gates</h2> Allah says that Ya`qub, peace be upon him, ordered his children, when he sent Binyamin with them to Egypt, to enter from different gates rather than all of them entering from one gate. Ibn `Abbas, Muhammad bin Ka`b, Mujahid, Ad-Dahhak Qatadah, As-Suddi and several others said that he feared the evil eye for them, because they were handsome and looked beautiful and graceful. He feared that people might direct the evil eye at them, because the evil eye truly harms, by Allah's decree, and brings down the mighty warrior-rider from his horse. He next said, l  ﴾وَمَآ أُغْنِى عَنكُمْ مِّنَ اللَّهِ مِن شَىْءٍ﴿ (and I cannot avail you against Allah at all.) this precaution will not resist Allah's decision and appointed decree. Verily, whatever Allah wills, cannot be resisted or stopped,  ﴾إِنِ الْحُكْمُ إِلاَّ للَّهِ عَلَيْهِ تَوَكَّلْتُ وَعَلَيْهِ فَلْيَتَوَكَّلِ الْمُتَوَكِّلُونَوَلَمَّا دَخَلُواْ مِنْ حَيْثُ أَمَرَهُمْ أَبُوهُم مَّا كَانَ يُغْنِى عَنْهُمْ مِّنَ اللَّهِ مِن شَىْءٍ إِلاَّ حَاجَةً فِى نَفْسِ يَعْقُوبَ قَضَاهَا﴿ (\"Verily, the decision rests only with Allah. In Him, I put my trust and let all those that trust, put their trust in Him.\" And when they entered according to their father's advice, it did not avail them in the least against (the will of) Allah; it was but a need of Ya`qub's inner self which he discharged. ), as a precaution against the evil eye,  ﴾وَإِنَّهُ لَذُو عِلْمٍ لِّمَا عَلَّمْنَاهُ﴿ (And verily, he was endowed with knowledge because We had taught him,) he had knowledge that he implemented, according to Qatadah and Ath-Thawri. Ibn Jarir said that this part of the Ayah means, he has knowledge that We taught him,  ﴾وَلَـكِنَّ أَكْثَرَ النَّاسِ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ﴿ (but most men know not.)  "
  12,69,"<h2>Yusuf comforts Binyamin</h2> Allah states that when Yusuf's brothers went in before him along with his full brother Binyamin, he invited them to a place of honor as privileged guests. He granted them gifts and generous hospitality and kindness. He met his brother in confidence and told him the story of what happened to him and that he was in fact his brother. He said to him,  ﴾لاتَبْتَئِسْ﴿ `(grieve not) nor feel sad for what they did to me.' He ordered Binyamin to hide the news from them and to refrain from telling them that the `Aziz is his brother Yusuf. He plotted with him to keep him in Egypt enjoying honor and great hospitality.  "
