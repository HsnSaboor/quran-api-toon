  75,25,"<h2>How the Prophet received the Revelation</h2> This is Allah teaching His Messenger how to receive the revelation from the angel. For verily, he (the Prophet ) was rushing in his attempts to grasp the revelation and he would be reciting the revelation with the angel while he was reciting it. Therefore, Allah commanded him that when the angel brings some revelation to him he should just listen. Allah would make sure to collect it in his chest, and He would make it easy for him to recite it in the same way that it was revealed to him. Allah would explain it, interpret it and clarify it for him. So the first phase was gathering it in his chest, the second phase was recitation and the third phase was its explanation and clarification of its meaning. Thus, Allah says,  لاَ تُحَرِّكْ بِهِ لِسَانَكَ لِتَعْجَلَ بِهِ  (Move not your tongue concerning to make haste therewith.) meaning, with the Qur'an. This is as Allah says,  وَلاَ تَعْجَلْ بِالْقُرْءانِ مِن قَبْلِ إَن يُقْضَى إِلَيْكَ وَحْيُهُ وَقُل رَّبِّ زِدْنِى عِلْماً  (And be not in haste with the Qur'an before its revelation is completed to you, and say: \"My Lord! Increase me in knowledge.\") (20:114) Then Allah says,  إِنَّ عَلَيْنَا جَمْعَهُ  (It is for Us to collect it) meaning, `in your chest.'  وَقُرْءَانَهُ  (and that it be recited.) meaning, `that you recite it.'  فَإِذَا قَرَأْنَـهُ  (And when We have recited it to you,) meaning, `when the angel has recited it to you from Allah,'  فَاتَّبِعْ قُرْءَانَهُ  (then follow its recitation.) meaning, `listen to it then recite it as he taught you to recite it.'  ثُمَّ إِنَّ عَلَيْنَا بَيَانَهُ  (Then it is for Us to make it clear.) meaning, `after memorizing it and reciting it, We will explain it to you, clarify it and inspire you with its meaning according to what We intended and legislated.' Imam Ahmad recorded from Ibn `Abbas that he said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ used to struggle very hard to grasp the revelation and he used to move his lips (rapidly with the recitation). The narrator, Sa`id, then said, \"Ibn `Abbas said to me, `I will move my lips like the Messenger of Allah ﷺ used to move his lips (in order to show you).\"' Then, the subnarrator said, \"And Sa`id said to me, `I will move my lips like I saw Ibn `Abbas moving his lips (in order to show you).\"' Then Allah revealed,  لاَ تُحَرِّكْ بِهِ لِسَانَكَ لِتَعْجَلَ بِهِ - إِنَّ عَلَيْنَا جَمْعَهُ وَقُرْءَانَهُ  (Move not your tongue concerning to make haste therewith. It is for Us to collect it and that it be recited.) Ibn `Abbas said, \"This means He will collect it in his chest to recite it.  فَإِذَا قَرَأْنَـهُ فَاتَّبِعْ قُرْءَانَهُ  (And when We have recited it to you, then follow its recitation.) meaning, listen to it and pay attention.  ثُمَّ إِنَّ عَلَيْنَا بَيَانَهُ  (Then it is for Us to make it clear (to you).) So after this, when Jibril would leave, he would recite it as Jibril had taught him to recite it.\" This has also been recorded by Al-Bukhari and Muslim. Al-Bukhari's wording says, \"So whenever Jibril would come to him he would be silent, and when Jibril had left he would recite it just as Allah, the Mighty and Sublime had promised him.\" <h2>The Cause of rejecting the Day of Judgement is Love of the World and Heedlessness of the Hereafter</h2> Concerning Allah's statement,  كَلاَّ بَلْ تُحِبُّونَ الْعَاجِلَةَ - وَتَذَرُونَ الاٌّخِرَةَ  (But no! Rather you love the present life of this world. And neglect the Hereafter.) meaning, the only thing that has caused them to reject the Day of Judgement and oppose the true revelation and the Mighty Qur'an Allah revealed to His Messenger is that their only concern is the present worldly life. They are preoccupied and distracted from the Hereafter. nt, and when Jibril had left he would recite it just as Allah, the Mighty and Sublime had promised him.\" sed to move his lips (rapidly with the recitation). The narrator, Sa`id, then said, \"Ibn `Abbas said to me, `I will move my lips like the Messenger of Allah ﷺ used to move his lips (in order to show you).\"' Then, the subnarrator said, \"And Sa`id said to me, `I will move my lips like I saw Ibn `Abbas moving his lips (in order to show you).\"' Then Allah revealed,  لاَ تُحَرِّكْ بِهِ لِسَانَكَ لِتَعْجَلَ بِهِ - إِنَّ عَلَيْنَا جَمْعَهُ وَقُرْءَانَهُ  (Move not your tongue concerning to make haste therewith. It is for Us to collect it and that it be recited. rec?kA ? The Cause of rejecting the Day of Judgement is Love of the World and Heedlessness of the Hereafter Concerning Allah's statement,  كَلاَّ بَلْ تُحِبُّونَ الْعَاجِلَةَ - وَتَذَرُونَ الاٌّخِرَةَ  (But no! Rather you love the present life of this world. And neglect the Hereafter.) meaning, the only thing that has caused them to reject the Day of Judgement and oppose the true revelation and the Mighty Qur'an Allah revealed to His Messenger is that their only concern is the present worldly life. They are preoccupied and distracted from the Hereafter. <h2>Seeing Allah in the Hereafter</h2> Then Allah says,  وُجُوهٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ نَّاضِرَةٌ  (Some faces that Day shall be Nadirah.) which comes from the word Nadarah, which means splendid, radiant, glowing, delighted with goodness.  إِلَى رَبِّهَا نَاظِرَةٌ  (Looking at their Lord.) meaning, they will see Him with their very eyes. This is just as was recorded by Al-Bukhari in his Sahih,  «إِنَّكُمْ سَتَرَوْنَ رَبَّكُمْ عِيَانًا»  (Verily, you all will see your Lord with your own eyes.) The believers seeing Allah in the abode of the Hereafter has been confirmed in the authentic Hadiths from numerous routes of transmission with the scholars of Hadith. It is not possible to deny this or refuse it. Examples would be the Hadiths of Abu Sa`id and Abu Hurayrah, and they are both recorded in the Two Sahihs. They both mentioned that some people said, \"O Messenger of Allah! Will we see our Lord on the Day of Judgement\" The Prophet said,  «هَلْ تُضَارُّونَ فِي رُؤْيَةِ الشَّمْسِ وَالْقَمَرِ لَيْسَ دُونَهُمَا سَحَابٌ؟»  (Are you harmed by seeing the sun and the moon when there are no clouds beneath them) They replied, \"No.\" The Prophet then said,  «فَإِنَّكُمْ تَرَوْنَ رَبَّكُمْ كَذَلِك»  (Then you will surely see your Lord like that.) In the Two Sahihs it is recorded from Jabir that he said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ looked at the moon on a night when it was full, and he said,  «إِنَّكُمْ تَرَوْنَ رَبَّكُمْ كَمَا تَرَوْنَ هَذَا الْقَمَرَ، فَإِنِ اسْتَطَعْتُمْ أَنْ لَا تُغْلَبُوا عَلَى صَلَاةٍ قَبْلَ طُلُوعِ الشَّمْسِ وَلَا قَبْلَ غُرُوبِهَا، فَافْعَلُوا»  (Verily, you will see your Lord just as you see this moon! So if you are able to avoid missing a prayer before the rising of the sun (Fajr prayer) or before its setting (`Asr prayer) then do so.)\" Among the Hadiths, which Muslim was alone in recording, is a narration from Suhayb that the Prophet said,  «إِذَا دَخَلَ أَهْلُ الْجَنَّةِ الْجَنَّةَ قَالَ يَقُولُ اللهُ تَعَالى: تُرِيدُونَ شَيْئًا أَزِيدُكُمْ؟ فَيَقُولُونَ: أَلَمْ تُبَيِّضْ وُجُوهَنَا؟ أَلَمْ تُدْخِلْنَا الْجَنَّةَ وَتُنَجِّنَا مِنَ النَّارِ؟ قَالَ: فَيَكْشِفُ الْحِجَابَ، فَمَا أُعْطُوا شَيْئًا أَحَبَّ إِلَيْهِمْ مِنَ النَّظَرِ إِلَى رَبِّهِمْ، وَهِيَ الزِّيَادَة»  (When the people of Paradise enter the Paradise, Allah will say, `Do you want me to give you anything extra' They will say, `Haven't you whitened our faces Haven't you entered us into Paradise and saved us from the Fire' Then He will remove the veil and they will not be given anything more beloved to them than looking at their Lord, and that will be the extra (Ziyadah).) Then he recited this Ayah,  لِّلَّذِينَ أَحْسَنُواْ الْحُسْنَى وَزِيَادَةٌ  (For those who have done good is the best and extra (Ziyadah).) (10:26) Also among the Hadiths, which Muslim was alone in recording, is the Hadith of Jabir in which the Prophet said,  «إِنَّ اللهَ يَتَجَلَّى لِلْمُؤْمِنِينَ يَضْحَك»  (Verily, Allah will appear before the believers while He is laughing.) This will take place on the open plains of the Resurrection place. In some of these Hadiths, it mentions that the believers will be looking at their Lord on the open plains and some mention that this will occur in the Gardens of Paradise. If it were not due to fear of taking up a lot of space, we would present all of these Hadiths with their routes of transmission and wordings from those that are in the Sahih collections, the collections of good narrations, the Musnad collections and the Sunan collections. However, we have mentioned this in separate places in this Tafsir, and Allah is the Giver of success. This issue is something that the Companions, the Successors and the Salaf of this nation have agreed upon, and all praise is due to Allah. It is something that is agreed upon between the Imams of Islam and the guides of all mankind. <h2>Blackening of the Faces of the Disobedient People on the Day of Judgement</h2> Allah says,  وَوُجُوهٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ بَاسِرَةٌ - تَظُنُّ أَن يُفْعَلَ بِهَا فَاقِرَةٌ  (And some faces that Day will be Basirah. Thinking that some calamity is about to fall on them.) These are the faces of the sinners that will be Basirah on the Day of Judgement. Qatadah said, \"This means gloomy.\" As-Suddi said, \"Their (the faces) color will change.\"  تَظُنُّ  (Thinking) meaning, they will be certain.  أَن يُفْعَلَ بِهَا فَاقِرَةٌ  (that some calamity is about to fall on them.) Mujahid said, \"A disaster.\" Qatadah said, \"An evil.\" As-Suddi said, \"They will be certain that they are going to be destroyed.\" Ibn Zayd said, \"They will think that they are going to enter into the Hellfire.\" This situation is similar to Allah's statement,  يَوْمَ تَبْيَضُّ وُجُوهٌ وَتَسْوَدُّ وُجُوهٌ  (On the Day when some faces will become white and some faces will become black.) (3:106) Similarly Allah says,  وُجُوهٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ مُّسْفِرَةٌ - ضَـحِكَةٌ مُّسْتَبْشِرَةٌ - وَوُجُوهٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ عَلَيْهَا غَبَرَةٌ - تَرْهَقُهَا قَتَرَةٌ - أُوْلَـئِكَ هُمُ الْكَفَرَةُ الْفَجَرَةُ  (Some faces that Day will be bright. Laughing, rejoicing at the good news. And other faces, that Day will be dust-stained; darkness will cover them, such will be the disbelieving, wicked.) (80:38-42) Allah also says,  وُجُوهٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ خَـشِعَةٌ - عَامِلَةٌ نَّاصِبَةٌ - تَصْلَى نَاراً حَامِيَةً  (Some faces, that Day will be humiliated. Laboring, weary. They will enter in the hot blazing Fire.) (88:2-4) until Allah says,  وُجُوهٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ نَّاعِمَةٌ - لِّسَعْيِهَا رَاضِيَةٌ فِى جَنَّةٍ عَالِيَةٍ  ((Other) faces that Day will be joyful. Happy with their endeavor. In a lofty Paradise.) (88:8-10) And there are other similar Ayat and discussions (in the Qur'an). "

  75,40,"<h2>Certainty will Occur at the Time of Death. Allah Informs of the Condition at the Time of Death and What Terrors it Contains.</h2> May Allah make us firm at that time with the Firm Statement. Allah says,  كَلاَّ إِذَا بَلَغَتِ التَّرَاقِىَ  (Nay, when it reaches to the collarbones.) If we make the word \"Kalla\" negative, then this Ayah means, `O son of Adam! You are not able to deny that which I informed you of at that time (death). This will become something witnessed by you with your own eyes.' If we consider the word \"Kalla\" to be a word of affirmation, then this would be the most obvious meaning. In this case it would mean that it is certainly true when the soul reaches the collarbones - meaning, `your soul will be pulled out of your body and it will reach your collarbones.' This is similar to Allah's statement,  فَلَوْلاَ إِذَا بَلَغَتِ الْحُلْقُومَ - وَأَنتُمْ حِينَئِذٍ تَنظُرُونَ - وَنَحْنُ أَقْرَبُ إِلَيْهِ مِنكُمْ وَلَـكِن لاَّ تُبْصِرُونَ - فَلَوْلاَ إِن كُنتُمْ غَيْرَ مَدِينِينَ - تَرْجِعُونَهَآ إِن كُنتُمْ صَـدِقِينَ  (Then why do you not (intervene) when (the soul of the dying person) reaches the throat And you at the moment are looking on, but We are nearer to him than you, but you see not, then why do you not if you are exempt from the reckoning and recompense, bring back the soul, if your are truthful) (56:83-87) Thus, Allah similarly says here,  كَلاَّ إِذَا بَلَغَتِ التَّرَاقِىَ - وَقِيلَ مَنْ رَاقٍ  (Nay, when it reaches to the collarbones. And it will be said: \"Who can cure him) `Ikrimah reported from Ibn `Abbas that he said, \"Meaning, who is the person who recites divine prayers of healing so that he may come and cure him\" Abu Qilabah made a similar statement when he said,  وَقِيلَ مَنْ رَاقٍ  (And it will be said: \"Who can cure him) \"This means who is the doctor that can cure him\" Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and Ibn Zayd all have similar statements. `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas that he said concerning the Ayah,  وَالْتَفَّتِ السَّاقُ بِالسَّاقِ  (And one shank will be joined with another shank.) \"This is the last day of the days of this world and the first day of the days of the Hereafter. So there will be hardships that will meet (more) hardships, except for he whom Allah has mercy upon.\" `Ikrimah said,  وَالْتَفَّتِ السَّاقُ بِالسَّاقِ  (And one shank will be joined with another shank.) \"The great matter (will be joined) with the great matter.\" Mujahid said, \"A test (will be joined) with a test.\" Al-Hasan Al-Basri said concerning Allah's statement,  وَالْتَفَّتِ السَّاقُ بِالسَّاقِ  (And one shank will be joined with another shank. ) \"These are your two shins when they are bound together.\" In another narration from him (Al-Hasan) he said, \"His two legs have died and they will not carry him while he used to walk around on them.\" Concerning Allah's statement,  إِلَى رَبِّكَ يَوْمَئِذٍ الْمَسَاقُ  (The drive will be on that Day to your Lord!) meaning, the place of return and the destination. This is that the soul ascends into the heavens and Allah says, \"Return my servant to the earth, for verily, I have created them from it, I return them into it, and from it I will bring them out at another time.\" This has been reported in the lengthy Hadith of Al-Bara'. Verily, Allah says,  وَهُوَ الْقَاهِرُ فَوْقَ عِبَادِهِ وَيُرْسِلُ عَلَيْكُم حَفَظَةً حَتَّى إِذَا جَآءَ أَحَدَكُمُ الْمَوْتُ تَوَفَّتْهُ رُسُلُنَا وَهُمْ لاَ يُفَرِّطُونَ - ثُمَّ رُدُّواْ إِلَى اللَّهِ مَوْلَـهُمُ الْحَقِّ أَلاَ لَهُ الْحُكْمُ وَهُوَ أَسْرَعُ الْحَـسِبِينَ  (He is the Irresistible (Supreme), over His servants, and He sends guardians over you, until when death approaches one of you, Our messengers take his soul, and they never neglect their duty. Then they are returned to Allah, their True Master. Surely, for Him is the judgement and He is the <h2>Mentioning the Case of the Denier</h2> Allah says,  فَلاَ صَدَّقَ وَلاَ صَلَّى - وَلَـكِن كَذَّبَ وَتَوَلَّى  (So, he neither believed nor prayed! But on the contrary, he denied and turned away!) This is to inform about the disbeliever who used to deny the truth in his heart in the abode of this worldly life, and he used to turn away from acting according to its way. Thus, there is no good in him, internally or externally. Therefore, Allah says,  فَلاَ صَدَّقَ وَلاَ صَلَّى - وَلَـكِن كَذَّبَ وَتَوَلَّى - ثُمَّ ذَهَبَ إِلَى أَهْلِهِ يَتَمَطَّى  (So he neither believed nor prayed! But on the contrary, he denied and turned away! Then he walked in conceit (full pride) to his family admiring himself!)(75:31-33) meaning, stubborn, cruel, obstinate, wanton, lazy, having no concern and doing no deeds. This is similar to Allah's statement,  وَإِذَا انقَلَبُواْ إِلَى أَهْلِهِمْ انقَلَبُواْ فَكِهِينَ  (And when they returned to their own people, they would return jesting.) (83:31) Allah also says,  إِنَّهُ كَانَ فِى أَهْلِهِ مَسْرُوراً - إِنَّهُ ظَنَّ أَن لَّن يَحُورَ  (Verily, he was among his people in joy! Verily, he thought that he would never come back (to Us)!) (84:13,14) meaning, return.  بَلَى إِنَّ رَبَّهُ كَانَ بِهِ بَصِيراً  (Yes! Verily, his Lord has been ever beholding him!) (84:15) Ad-Dahhak reported from Ibn `Abbas that he said,  ثُمَّ ذَهَبَ إِلَى أَهْلِهِ يَتَمَطَّى  (Then he walked in conceit to his family admiring himself!) \"This means arrogantly.\" Qatadah and Zayd bin Aslam both said, \"Strutting.\" Allah then says,  أَوْلَى لَكَ فَأَوْلَى - ثُمَّ أَوْلَى لَكَ فَأَوْلَى  (Woe to you! And then woe to you! Again, woe to you! And then woe to you!) This is a definite warning and threat from Allah to those who disbelieve in Him and strut about when walking. This means, `you deserve to strut like this while you have disbelieved in your Creator and Maker.' This is what is commonly said in this type of situation in order to mock and intimidate (someone). This is as Allah says,  ذُقْ إِنَّكَ أَنتَ الْعَزِيزُ الْكَرِيمُ  (Taste you (this)! Verily you were (pretending to be) the mighty, the generous!) (44:49) Similarly, Allah says,  كُلُواْ وَتَمَتَّعُواْ قَلِيلاً إِنَّكُمْ مُّجْرِمُونَ  (Eat and enjoy yourselves for a little. Verily, you are criminals.) (77:46) Allah also says,  فَاعْبُدُواْ مَا شِئْتُمْ مِّن دُونِهِ  (So worship what you like besides Him.) (39:15) And like Allah's statement,  اعْمَلُواْ مَا شِئْتُمْ  (Do what you will.) (41:40) There are other examples of this as well. Abu `Abdur-Rahman An-Nasa'i recorded from Sa`id bin Jubayr that he said, \"I mentioned to Ibn `Abbas,  أَوْلَى لَكَ فَأَوْلَى - ثُمَّ أَوْلَى لَكَ فَأَوْلَى  (Woe to you! And then woe to you! Again, woe to you! And then woe to you!) He (Ibn `Abbas) replied, `The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said this to Abu Jahl, then Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, revealed this Ayah.\"' Ibn Abi Hatim recorded from Qatadah that he said concerning Allah's statement,  أَوْلَى لَكَ فَأَوْلَى - ثُمَّ أَوْلَى لَكَ فَأَوْلَى  (Woe to you! And then woe to you! Again, woe to you! And then woe to you!) \"It is a threat followed by a threat, just as you hear it. They claim that the Prophet of Allah grabbed the clothes of the enemy of Allah, Abu Jahl. The Prophet then said to him, `Woe to you! And then (again) woe to you! Again woe to you! And then (again) woe to you!' At this the enemy of Allah, Abu Jahl, said, `Are you threatening me, O Muhammad By Allah! Neither you nor your Lord are able to do anything, and verily, I am the mightiest person walking between its (Makkah's) two mountains.\"' <h2>Man will not be left neglected</h2> Allah says,  أَيَحْسَبُ الإِنسَـنُ أَن يُتْرَكَ سُدًى  (Does man think that he will be left neglected) As-Suddi said, \"Meaning not resurrected.\" Mujahid, Ash-Shafi`i and `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam, all said, \"Meaning, he will not be commanded and prohibited.\" Apparently the Ayah includes both meanings. This means that he will not be left neglected in this worldly life, without being commanded and prohibited. He also will not be left neglected in his grave unattended to without being resurrected. Rather he will be commanded and prohibited in this life, and gathered back to Allah in the abode of the Hereafter. The intent here is to affirm the existence of the abode of the final return and to refute whoever rejects it from the people of deviance, ignorance and stubbornness. Thus, Allah uses the beginning of creation as a proof for the repetition of the creation in His saying,  أَلَمْ يَكُ نُطْفَةً مِّن مَّنِىٍّ يُمْنَى  (Was he not a Nutfah of semen emitted) meaning, was not man a weak drop of sperm from a despised fluid known as semen, that is emitted from the loins into the wombs  ثُمَّ كَانَ عَلَقَةً فَخَلَقَ فَسَوَّى  (Then he became an `Alaqah; then shaped and fashioned in due proportion.) meaning, he became a clot, then a lump of flesh, then he was formed and the soul was blown into him. Then he became a perfect creation with healthy limbs, as either a male or a female by the permission and decree of Allah. Thus, Allah says,  فَجَعَلَ مِنْهُ الزَّوْجَيْنِ الذَّكَرَ وَالاٍّنثَى  (And made of him two sexes, male and female.) Then Allah says,  أَلَيْسَ ذَلِكَ بِقَـدِرٍ عَلَى أَن يُحْيِىَ الْمَوْتَى  (Is it not so then, that He would be able to give life to the dead) meaning, is not He Who made this perfect creation from this weak drop of sperm able to repeat that as He did originally And \"the ability to repeat that\" either refers to the origination only, or to both that and the process of perfecting it, according to two different views, as in Allah's saying;  وَهُوَ الَّذِى يَبْدَأُ الْخَلْقَ ثُمَّ يُعِيدُهُ وَهُوَ أَهْوَنُ عَلَيْهِ  (And He it is Who originates the creation, then He will repeat it; this is easier for Him.) (30:27) The first view is more popular, and Allah knows best. <h2>Supplication upon completing this Surah</h2> Abu Dawud recorded from Musa bin Abi `A'ishah that he said, \"A man used to pray on top of his house and whenever he recited,  أَلَيْسَ ذَلِكَ بِقَـدِرٍ عَلَى أَن يُحْيِىَ الْمَوْتَى  (Is it not so then, that He would be able to give life to the dead) he would say, `Glory to You, of course.' So the people asked him about that and he said, `I heard it from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ.\"' Abu Dawud was alone in transmitting this Hadith and he did not mention who this Companion was, but there is no harm in that. This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat Al-Qiyamah, all praise and thanks are due to Allah. "

  76,3,"<h2>Which was revealed in Makkah</h2><h2>The Recitation of Surat As-Sajdah and Al-Insan in the Morning Prayer on Friday</h2> It has been mentioned previously that it is recorded in Sahih Muslim from Ibn `Abbas that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ used to recite in the Morning prayer on Friday:  الم تَنزِيلَ  (Alif Lam Mim. The revelation...)(32) and;  هَلْ أَتَى عَلَى الإِنسَـنِ  (Has there not been over man...) (76)  بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ  In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. <h2>Allah created Man after He did not exist</h2> Allah informs that He brought man into existence after he was not even a thing worth mentioning, due to his lowliness and weakness. Allah says,  هَلْ أَتَى عَلَى الإِنسَـنِ حِينٌ مِّنَ الدَّهْرِ لَمْ يَكُن شَيْئاً مَّذْكُوراً  (Has there not been over man a period of time, when he was not a thing worth mentioning) Then Allah explains this by saying,  إِنَّا خَلَقْنَا الإِنسَـنَ مِن نُّطْفَةٍ أَمْشَاجٍ  (Verily, We have created man from Nutfah Amshaj,) meaning, mixed. The words Mashaj and Mashij mean something that is mixed together. Ibn `Abbas said concerning Allah's statement,  مِن نُّطْفَةٍ أَمْشَاجٍ  (from Nutfah Amshaj,) \"This means the fluid of the man and the fluid of the woman when they meet and mix.\" Then man changes after this from stage to stage, condition to condition and color to color. `Ikrimah, Mujahid, Al-Hasan and Ar-Rabi` bin Anas all made statements similar to this. They said, \"Amshaj is the mixing of the man's fluid with the woman's fluid.\" Concerning Allah's statement,  نَّبْتَلِيهِ  (in order to try him,) means, `We test him.' It is similar to Allah's statement,  لِيَبْلُوَكُمْ أَيُّكُمْ أَحْسَنُ عَمَلاً  (That He may test you which of you is best in deed.) (67:2) Then Allah says,  فَجَعَلْنَـهُ سَمِيعاً بَصِيراً  (so, We made him hearer and seer.) meaning, `We gave him the faculties of hearing and sight so that he would be able to use them for obedience and disobedience.' <h2>Allah guided Him to the Path, so Man is either Grateful or Ungrateful</h2> Allah says,  إِنَّا هَدَيْنَـهُ السَّبِيلَ  (Verily, We guided to him the way,) meaning, `We explained it to him, made it clear to him and showed it to him.' This is as Allah says,  وَأَمَّا ثَمُودُ فَهَدَيْنَـهُمْ فَاسْتَحَبُّواْ الْعَمَى عَلَى الْهُدَى  (And as for Thamud, We guided them but they preferred blindness to guidance.) (41:17) Allah also said,  وَهَدَيْنَـهُ النَّجْدَينِ  (And We guided him to the two ways.) (90:10) meaning, `We explained to him the path of good and the path of evil.' This is the statement of `Ikrimah, `Atiyah, Ibn Zayd and Mujahid from what is well-known from him and the majority. Allah then says,  إِمَّا شَاكِراً وَإِمَّا كَفُوراً  (Whether he be grateful or ungrateful.) This is his decree. Thus, with this he is either wretched or happy. This is like what has been recorded by Muslim in a Hadith from Abu Malik Al-Ash`ari. He said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,  «كُلُّ النَّاسِ يَغْدُو فَبَائِعٌ نَفْسَهُ، فَمُوبِقُهَا أَوْ مُعْتِقُهَا»  (All of mankind wakes up in the morning the merchant of his own soul. So he either imprisons it or sets it free. ) "
