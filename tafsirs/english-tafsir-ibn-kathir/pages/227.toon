  11,47,"<h2>A Return to the Story of the Son of Nuh and mentioning what transpired between Nuh and Allah concerning Him</h2> This was a request for information and an inquiry from Nuh concerning the cirumstances of his son's drowning.  ﴾فَقَالَ رَبِّ إِنَّ ابُنِى مِنْ أَهْلِى﴿ (and said, \"O my Lord! Verily, my son is of my family!\") This means, \"Verily, You promised to save my family and Your promise is the truth that does not fail. Therefore, how can he (my son) be drowned and You are the Most Just of the judges\"  ﴾قَالَ ينُوحُ إِنَّهُ لَيْسَ مِنْ أَهْلِكَ﴿ (He (Allah) said: \"O Nuh! Surely, he is not of your family...\") This means, \"He (your son) is not of those whom I promised to save. I only promised you that I would save those of your family who believe.\" For this reason Allah said,  ﴾وَأَهْلَكَ إِلاَّ مَن سَبَقَ عَلَيْهِ الْقَوْلُ مِنْهُمْ﴿ l(and your family except him against whom the Word has already gone forth.) 11:40 Thus, for his son, it had already been decreed that he would be drowned due to his disbelief and his opposition to his father, the Prophet of Allah, Nuh peace be upon him. Concerning Allah's statement,  ﴾إِنَّهُ لَيْسَ مِنْ أَهْلِكَ﴿ (Surely, he is not of your family;) meaning that he (Nuh's son) was not among those whom Allah promised to save. `Abdur-Razzaq recorded that Ibn `Abbas said, \"He was the son of Nuh, but he opposed him in deeds and intention.\" `Ikrimah said in some of the modes of recitation it said here, (إِنَّهُ عَمِلَ عَمَلًا غَيْرَ صَالِحٍ) \"Verily, he (Nuh's son) worked deeds that were not righteous.\"  "
  11,48,"<h2>The Command to descend from the Ship with Peace and Blessings</h2> Allah, the Exalted, informs of what was said to Nuh when the ship anchored on Mount Judi, peace be upon him, peace were sent upon him and the believers with him. This salutation was also for every believer from his progeny until the Day of Resurrection. Muhammad bin Ka`b said, \"Every male and female believer until the Day of Resurrection is included in this salutation of peace. Likewise, every male and female disbeliever until the Day of Resurrection is included in this promise of torment and pleasure. Muhammad bin Ishaq said, \"When Allah wanted to stop the flood, He sent a wind upon the face of the earth that caused the water to be still. Then the springs of the earth were closed off from the great flooding and the pouring (rain) from the sky halted. Allah, the Exalted, says,  ﴾وَقِيلَ يَأَرْضُ ابْلَعِى مَآءَكِ﴿ (And it was said: \"O earth! Swallow up your water...\") 11:44 Thus, the water began decreasing and subsiding until the ship settled on Mount Judi. The People of the Tawrah (the Jews) claim that this occurred during the seventh month (of the year) and it lasted for seventeen nights. Then, on the first day of the tenth month, he (Nuh) saw the mountain tops. Then after forty more days, Nuh opened the small window in the roof of the ship and he sent a raven out to see what the water had done. However, the raven did not return to him. Then, he sent a pigeon out but it returned to him without finding any place (land) to put its two feet down. He extended his hand out of the ship and the pigeon grabbed his hand so that Nuh could pull it back into the ship. Then, after seven more days passed, he sent the pigeon out again to investigate for him. The pigeon returned in the evening with a leaf from an olive tree in its mouth. From this, Nuh knew that the water had decreased from the face of the earth. He remained in the ship for seven more days before he sent the pigeon out again. This time the pigeon did not return to him, so he knew that the earth had appeared. Thus, a year was completed from the time that Allah sent the flood, until the time of Nuh sending the pigeon. The first day of the first month of the second year began when the face of the earth appeared and land became visible. This is when Nuh uncovered the opening of the ship. During the second month of the second year, after twenty six nights,  ﴾قِيلَ ينُوحُ اهْبِطْ بِسَلَـمٍ مِّنَّا﴿ (It was said: \"O Nuh! Come down (from the ship) with peace from Us)  "
  11,49,"<h2>The Explanation of These Stories is a Proof of the Revelation of Allah to His Messenger</h2> Allah, the Exalted, says to His Prophet concerning these stories and their like,  ﴾مِنْ أَنبَآءِ الْغَيْبِ﴿ (of the news of the Unseen) from the information of the unseen of the past. Allah revealed it to you (the Prophet ) in the way that it occurred, as if he witnessed it himself.  ﴾نُوحِيهَآ إِلَيْكَ﴿ (which We reveal unto you;) This means, \"We teach it to you (Muhammad) as revelation from Us to you.\"  ﴾مَا كُنتَ تَعْلَمُهَآ أَنتَ وَلاَ قَوْمُكَ مِن قَبْلِ هَـذَا﴿ (neither you nor your people knew it before this.) This means that neither you (Muhammad ) nor anyone of your people, have any knowledge of this. This is so that no one who rejects you can say that you learned it from him. Rather, it was Allah Who informed you of it in conformity with the true situation (of the story), just as the Books of the Prophets who were before you testify to. Therefore, you should be patient with the rejection of your people and their harming you. For verily, We shall help you and surround you with Our aid. Then, We will make the (good) end for you and those who follow you in this life and the Hereafter. This is what We did with the Messengers when We helped them against their enemies.  ﴾إِنَّا لَنَنصُرُ رُسُلَنَا وَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ﴿ (Verily, We will indeed make victorious Our Messengers and those who believe.) Allah also said,  ﴾وَلَقَدْ سَبَقَتْ كَلِمَتُنَا لِعِبَادِنَا الْمُرْسَلِينَ - إِنَّهُمْ لَهُمُ الْمَنصُورُونَ ﴿ (And, verily, Our Word has gone forth of old for Our servants, the Messengers, that they verily, would be made triumphant.) 37:171-172 Then, Allah says,  ﴾فَاصْبِرْ إِنَّ الْعَـقِبَةَ لِلْمُتَّقِينَ﴿ (So be patient. Surely, the (good) end is for those who have Taqwa.)  "

  11,52,"<h2>The Story of Prophet Hud and the People of `Ad</h2> Allah, the Exalted, says,  ﴾و﴿ (And) This is an introductory to what is implied: \"Verily, We sent.\"  ﴾إِلَى عَادٍ أَخَاهُمْ هُودًا﴿ (to the `Ad (people) their brother Hud.) Hud came to them commanding them to worship Allah alone, without any associates. He forbade them from worshipping the idols which they made up, inventing names as gods. He informed them that he did not want any reward from them for his sincere advising and conveying of Allah's Message. He only sought his reward from Allah, the One Who created him.  ﴾أَفَلاَ تَعْقِلُونَ﴿ (Will you not then understand) Someone has come calling you to what will benefit your situation in this life and the Hereafter without asking for any wage (from them). Then he commanded them to seek the forgiveness of the One Who is capable of expiating previous sins. He also commanded them to repent for that which they may do in the future. Whoever has these characteristics, Allah will make his sustenance easy for him, grant him ease in his affairs and guard over his situation. For this reason Allah says,  ﴾يُرْسِلِ السَّمَآءَ عَلَيْكُمْ مِدْرَاراً ﴿ (He will send you (from the sky) abundant rain,)  "
