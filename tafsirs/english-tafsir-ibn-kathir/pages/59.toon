  3,74,"<h2>The Envy the Jews Feel Towards Muslims; Their Wicked Plots Against Muslims</h2> Allah states that the Jews envy the faithful and wish they could misguide them. Allah states that the punishment of this behavior will fall back upon them, while they are unaware. Allah criticizes them,  يأَهْلَ الْكِتَـبِ لِمَ تَكْفُرُونَ بِأَيَـتِ اللَّهِ وَأَنتُمْ تَشْهَدُونَ  (O People of the Scripture!: Why do you disbelieve in the Ayat of Allah, while you bear witness.)  You know for certain that Allah's Ayat are true and authentic,  يأَهْلَ الْكِتَـبِ لِمَ تَلْبِسُونَ الْحَقَّ بِالْبَـطِلِ وَتَكْتُمُونَ الْحَقَّ وَأَنتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ  (O People of the Scripture: Why do you mix truth with falsehood and conceal the truth while you know) by hiding what is in your Books about the description of Muhammad , while you know what you do.  وَقَالَت طَّآئِفَةٌ مِّنْ أَهْلِ الْكِتَـبِ ءَامِنُواْ بِالَّذِي أُنزِلَ عَلَى الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَجْهَ النَّهَارِ وَاكْفُرُواْ ءَاخِرَهُ  (And a party of the People of the Scripture say: \"Believe in the morning in that which is revealed to the believers, and reject it at the end of the day,)  This is a wicked plan from the People of the Book to deceive Muslims who are weak in the religion. They decided that they would pretend to be believers in the beginning of the day, by attending the dawn prayer with the Muslims. However, when the day ended, they would revert to their old religion so that the ignorant people would say, \"They reverted to their old religion because they uncovered some shortcomings in the Islamic religion.\" This is why they said next.  لَعَلَّهُمْ يَرْجِعُونَ  (so that they may turn back.) Ibn Abi Najih said that Mujahid commented about this Ayah, which refers to the Jews, \"They attended the dawn prayer with the Prophet and disbelieved in the end of the day in order to misguide the people. This way, people would think that they have uncovered shortcomings in the religion that they briefly followed.\"  وَلاَ تُؤْمِنُواْ إِلاَّ لِمَن تَبِعَ دِينَكُمْ  (\"And believe no one except the one who follows your religion.\")  They said, do not trust anyone with your secret knowledge, except those who follow your religion. Therefore, they say, do not expose your knowledge to Muslims in order to prevent them from believing in it and, thus, use it as proof against you. Allah replied,  قُلْ إِنَّ الْهُدَى هُدَى اللَّهِ  (Say: (O Prophet) \"Verily, right guidance is the guidance of Allah.\")  Allah guides the hearts of the faithful to the perfect faith through the clear Ayat, plain proofs and unequivocal evidence that He has sent down to His servant and Messenger Muhammad ﷺ. This occurs, O you Jews, even though you hide the description of Muhammad . the unlettered Prophet whom you find in your Books that you received from the earlier Prophets. Allah's statement;  أَن يُؤْتَى أَحَدٌ مِّثْلَ مَآ أُوتِيتُمْ أَوْ يُحَآجُّوكُمْ عِندَ رَبِّكُمْ  ((And they say: ) \"Do not believe that anyone can receive like that which you have received, otherwise they would engage you in argument before your Lord.\")  They say, \"Do not disclose the knowledge that you have to the Muslims, to prevent them from learning it and thus becoming your equals. They will be even better because they will believe in it or will use it against you as evidence with your Lord, and thus establish Allah's proof against you in this life and the Hereafter.\" Allah said,  قُلْ إِنَّ الْفَضْلَ بِيَدِ اللَّهِ يُؤْتِيهِ مَن يَشَآءُ  (Say: \"All the bounty is in the Hand of Allah; He grants to whom He wills.) meaning, all affairs are under His control, and He gives and takes. Verily, Allah gives faith, knowledge and sound comprehension to whomever He wills. He also misguides whomever He wills by blinding his sight, mind, sealing his heart, hearing and stamping his eyes closed. Allah has the perfect wisdom and the unequivocal proofs.  وَاللَّهُ وَسِعٌ عَلِيمٌيَخْتَصُّ بِرَحْمَتِهِ مَن يَشَآءُ وَاللَّهُ ذُو الْفَضْلِ الْعَظِيمِ  (And Allah is All-Sufficient for His creatures' needs, All-Knower.\" He selects for His mercy whom He wills and Allah is the Owner of great bounty.) meaning, He has endowed you, O believers, with tremendous virtue, in that He honored your Prophet Muhammad ﷺ over all other prophets, and by directing you to the best Shari`ah there is.

  3,76,"<h2>How Trustworthy Are the Jews</h2> Allah states that there are deceitful people among the Jews. He also warns the faithful against being deceived by them, because some of them,  مَنْ إِن تَأْمَنْهُ بِقِنْطَارٍ  (if entrusted with a Qintar (a great amount)) of money,  يُؤَدِّهِ إِلَيْكَ  (will readily pay it back;) This Ayah indicates that this type would likewise give what is less than a Qintar, as is obvious. However,  وَمِنْهُمْ مَّنْ إِن تَأْمَنْهُ بِدِينَارٍ لاَّ يُؤَدِّهِ إِلَيْكَ إِلاَّ مَا دُمْتَ عَلَيْهِ قَآئِمًا  (and among them there is he who, if entrusted with a single silver coin, will not repay it unless you constantly stand demanding,) and insisting on acquiring your rightful property. If this is what he would do with one Dinar, then what about what is more than a Dinar We mentioned the meaning of Qintar in the beginning of this Surah, while the value of Dinar is well known. Allah's statement,  ذَلِكَ بِأَنَّهُمْ قَالُواْ لَيْسَ عَلَيْنَا فِى الأُمِّيِّينَ سَبِيلٌ  (because they say: \"There is no blame on us to betray and take the properties of the illiterates (Arabs).\") means, what made them reject the truth (or what they owed) is that they said, \"There is no harm in our religion if we eat up the property of the unlettered ones, the Arabs, for Allah has allowed it for us.\" Allah replied,  وَيَقُولُونَ عَلَى اللَّهِ الْكَذِبَ وَهُمْ يَعْلَمُونَ  (But they tell a lie against Allah while they know it.) for they invented this lie and word of misguidance. Rather, Allah would not allow this money for them unless they had a right to it.  `Abdur-Razzaq recorded that Sa`sa`ah bin Yazid said that a man asked Ibn `Abbas, \"During battle, we capture some property belonging to Ahl Adh-Dhimmah, such as chickens and sheep.\" Ibn `Abbas said, \"What do you do in this case\" The man said, \"We say that there is no sin (if we confiscate them) in this case.\" He said, \"That is what the People of the Book said,  لَيْسَ عَلَيْنَا فِى الأُمِّيِّينَ سَبِيلٌ  (There is no blame on us to betray and take the properties of the illiterates (Arabs).)  Verily, if they pay the Jizyah, then you are not allowed their property, except when they willingly give it up.\"  Allah then said,  بَلَى مَنْ أَوْفَى بِعَهْدِهِ وَاتَّقَى  (Yes, whoever fulfills his pledge and fears Allah much,) fulfills his promise and fears Allah among you, O People of the Book, regarding the covenant Allah took from you to believe in Muhammad ﷺ when he is sent, just as He took the same covenant from all Prophets and their nations. Whoever avoids Allah's prohibitions, obeys Him and adheres to the Shari`ah that He sent with His Final Messenger and the master of all mankind.  فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ يُحِبُّ الْمُتَّقِينَ  (verily, then Allah loves the Muttaqin.) "
  3,77,"<h2>There is No Share in the Hereafter for Those Who Break Allah's Covenant</h2> Allah states that whoever prefers the small things of this short, soon to end life, instead of fulfilling what they have promised Allah by following Muhammad , announcing his description from their books to people and affirming his truth, then,  أُوْلَـئِكَ لاَ خَلَـقَ لَهُمْ فِى الاٌّخِرَةِ  (they shall have no portion in the Hereafter.)  They will not have a share or part in the Hereafter's rewards,  وَلاَ يُكَلِّمُهُمُ اللَّهُ وَلاَ يَنظُرُ إِلَيْهِمْ يَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ  (Neither will Allah speak to them nor look at them on the Day of Resurrection) with His mercy. This Ayah indicates that Allah will not speak words of kindness nor look at them with any mercy,  وَلاَ يُزَكِّيهِمْ  (nor will He purify them) from sins and impurities. Rather, He will order them to the Fire,  وَلَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ  (and they shall have a painful torment.)  There are several Hadiths on the subject of this Ayah, some of which follow. The First Hadith  Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Dharr said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said, c  «ثَلَاثَةٌ لَا يُكَلِّمُهُمُ اللهُ، وَلَا يَنْظُرُ إِلَيْهِمْ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ، وَلَا يُزَكِّيهِمْ، وَلَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيم»  قلت: يا رسول الله، من هم؟ خابوا وخسروا قال: وأعاده رسول اللهصلى الله عليه وسلّم ثلاث مرات، قال:  «الْمُسْبِلُ، وَالْمُنَفِّقُ سِلْعَتَهُ بِالْحَلِفِ الْكَاذِبِ، وَالْمَنَّان»  (There are three persons whom Allah will not speak to, look at on the Day of Resurrection or purify, and they shall taste a painful torment. I said, `O Messenger of Allah! Who are they, may they gain failure and loss' He said, repeating this statement thrice, `The Musbil (man whose clothes reach below the ankles), he who swears while lying so as to sell his merchandize and the one who gives charity and reminds people of it).')\" This was also recorded by Muslim, and the collectors of the Sunan. Another Hadith  Imam Ahmad recorded that `Adi bin `Amirah Al-Kindi said, \"Imru' Al-Qays bin `Abis, a man from Kindah, disputed with a man from Hadramut in front of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ concerning a piece of land. The Prophet required the man from Hadramut to present his evidence, but he did not have any. The Prophet required Imru' Al-Qays to swear to his truthfulness, but the man from Hadramut said, `O Messenger of Allah! If you only require him to swear, then by the Lord of the Ka`bah (Allah), my land is lost.' The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,  «مَنْ حَلَفَ عَلى يَمِينٍ كَاذِبَةٍ لِيَقْتَطِعَ بِهَا مَالَ أَحَدٍ، لَقِيَ اللهَ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ وَهُوَ عَلَيْهِ غَضْبَان»  (Whoever swears while lying to acquire the property of others, will meet Allah while He is angry with him.)\" Raja' one of the narrators of the Hadith, said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ then recited,  إِنَّ الَّذِينَ يَشْتَرُونَ بِعَهْدِ اللَّهِ وَأَيْمَـنِهِمْ ثَمَنًا قَلِيًلا  (Verily, those who purchase a small gain at the cost of Allah's covenant and their oaths...)  Imru' Al-Qays said, `What if one forfeits this dispute, what will he gain, O Messenger of Allah' The Prophet answered, `Paradise.' Imru' Al-Qays said, `Bear witness that I forfeit all the land for him.\"' An-Nasa'i also recorded this Hadith. Another Hadith  Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,  «مَنْ حَلَفَ عَلى يَمِينٍ هُوَ فِيهَا فَاجِرٌ، لِيَقْتَطِعَ بِهَا مَالَ امْرِى مُسْلِمٍ، لَقِيَ اللهَ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ وَهُوَ عَلَيْهِ غَضْبَان»  (Whoever takes a false oath to deprive a Muslim of his property will meet Allah while He is angry with him.)  Al-Ash`ath said, \"By Allah! This verse was revealed concerning me. I owned some land with a Jewish man who denied my right, and I complained against him to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. The Prophet asked me, `Do you have evidence' I said, `I don't have evidence.' He said to the Jew, `Take an oath then.' I said, `O Allah's Messenger! He will take a (false) oath immediately, and I will lose my property.' Allah revealed the verse,  إِنَّ الَّذِينَ يَشْتَرُونَ بِعَهْدِ اللَّهِ وَأَيْمَـنِهِمْ ثَمَنًا قَلِيًلا  (Verily, those who purchase a small gain at the cost of Allah's covenant and their oaths...)\"  The Two Sahihs recorded this Hadith. Another Hadith  Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,  «ثَلَاثَةٌ لَا يُكَلِّمُهُمُ اللهُ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ، وَلَا يَنْظُرُ إِلَيْهِمْ، وَلَا يُزَكِّيهِمْ، وَلَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ: رَجُلٌ مَنَعَ ابْنَ السَّبِيلِ فَضْلَ مَاءٍ عِنْدَهُ، وَرَجُلٌ حَلَفَ عَلى سِلْعَةٍ بَعْدَ الْعَصْرِ يَعْنِي كَاذِبًا وَرَجُلٌ بَايَعَ إِمَامًا، فَإِنْ أَعْطَاهُ وَفَى لَهُ، وَإِنْ لَمْ يُعْطِهِ لَمْ يَفِ لَه»  (Three persons whom Allah shall not speak to on the Day of Resurrection, or look at, or purify them, and they shall taste a painful torment. (They are) a man who does not give the wayfarer some of the water that he has; a man who swears, while lying, in order to complete a sales transaction after the `Asr prayer; and a man who gives his pledge of allegiance to an Imam (Muslim Ruler), and if the Imam gives him (something), he fulfills the pledge, but if the Imam does not give him, he does not fulfill the pledge).  Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi also recorded this Hadith, and At-Tirmidhi graded it Hasan Sahih. "
