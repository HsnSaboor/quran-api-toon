tafsir[3]{c,v,t}:
  4,176,"<h2>This is the Last Ayah Ever Revealed, the Ruling on Al-Kalalah</h2> Al-Bukhari recorded that Al-Bara' said that the last Surah to be revealed was Surah Bara'ah (chapter 9) and the last Ayah to be revealed was,  يَسْتَفْتُونَكَ  (They ask you for a legal verdict...) Imam Ahmad recorded that Jabir bin `Abdullah said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ came visiting me when I was so ill that I fell unconscious. He performed ablution and poured the remaining water on me, or had it poured on me. When I regained consciousness, I said, `I will only leave inheritance through Kalalah, so what about the inheritance that I leave behind' Allah later revealed the Ayah about Fara'id (inheritance 4:11).\"' The Two Sahihs and also the Group recorded it. In one of the wordings, Jabir said that the Ayah on inheritance was revealed;  يَسْتَفْتُونَكَ قُلِ اللَّهُ يُفْتِيكُمْ فِى الْكَلَـلَةِ  (They ask you for a legal verdict. Say: \"Allah directs (thus) about Al-Kalalah.) The wording of the Ayah indicates that the question was about the Kalalah,  قُلِ اللَّهُ يُفْتِيكُمْ  (Say: \"Allah directs (thus)...) We mentioned the meaning of Kalalah before, that it means the crown that surrounds the head from all sides. This is why the scholars stated that Kalalah pertains to one who dies and leaves behind neither descendants, nor ascendants. Some said that the Kalalah pertains to one who has no offspring, as the Ayah states,  إِن امْرُؤٌ هَلَكَ لَيْسَ لَهُ وَلَدٌ  (If it is a man that dies, leaving no child,) The meaning and ruling of Kalalah was somewhat confusing to the Leader of the Faithful `Umar bin Al-Khattab. It is recorded in the Two Sahihs that `Umar said, \"There are three matters that I wished the Messenger of Allah ﷺ had explained to us, so that we could abide by his explanation. (They are: the share in the inheritance of) the grandfather, the Kalalah and a certain type of Riba.\" Imam Ahmad recorded that Ma`dan bin Abi Talhah said that `Umar bin Al-Khattab said, \"There is nothing that I asked the Messenger of Allah ﷺ about its meaning more than the Kalalah, until he stabbed me with his finger in my chest and said,  «يَكْفِيكَ آيَةُ الصَّيْفِ الَّتِي فِي آخِرِ سُورَةِ النِّسَاء»  (The Ayah that is in the end of Surat An-Nisa' should suffice for you.)\" Ahmad mentioned this short narration for this Hadith, Muslim recorded a longer form of it. <h2>The Meaning of This Ayah</h2> Allah said,  إِن امْرُؤٌ هَلَكَ  (If it is a man that dies.) Allah said in another Ayah,  كُلُّ شَىْءٍ هَالِكٌ إِلاَّ وَجْهَهُ  (Everything will perish save His Face.) Therefore, everything and everyone dies and perishes except Allah, the Exalted and Most Honored. Allah said,  كُلُّ مَنْ عَلَيْهَا فَانٍ - وَيَبْقَى وَجْهُ رَبِّكَ ذُو الْجَلْـلِ وَالإِكْرَامِ  (Whatsoever is on it (the earth) will perish. And the Face of your Lord full of majesty and honor will remain forever.) Allah said here,  لَيْسَ لَهُ وَلَدٌ  (leaving no child,) referring to the person who has neither children, nor parents. What testifies to this, is that Allah said afterwards,  وَلَهُ أُخْتٌ فَلَهَا نِصْفُ مَا تَرَكَ  (Leaving a sister, she shall have half the inheritance.) Had there been a surviving ascendant, the sister would not have inherited anything, and there is a consensus on this point. Therefore, this Ayah is referring to the man who dies leaving behind neither descendants nor ascendants, as is apparent for those who contemplate its meaning. This is because when there is a surviving parent, the sister does not inherit anything, let alone half of the inheritance. Ibn Jarir and others mentioned that Ibn `Abbas and Ibn Az-Zubayr used to judge that if a person dies and leaves behind a daughter and a sister, the sister does not inherit anything. They would recite,  إِن امْرُؤٌ هَلَكَ لَيْسَ لَهُ وَلَدٌ وَلَهُ أُخْتٌ فَلَهَا نِصْفُ مَا تَرَكَ  (If it is a man that dies, leaving a sister, but no child, she shall have half the inheritance.) They said that if one leaves behind a daughter, then he has left behind a child. Therefore the sister does not get anything. The majority of scholars disagreed with them, saying the daughter gets one half and the sister the other half, relying on other evidence. This Ayah (4:176 above) gives the sister half of the inheritance in the case that it specifies. As for giving the sister half in other cases, Al-Bukhari recorded that Sulayman said that Ibrahim reported to Al-Aswad that he said, \"During the time of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ , Mu`adh bin Jabal gave a judgment that the daughter gets one half and the sister the other half.\" Al-Bukhari recorded that Huzayl bin Shurahbil said, \"Abu Musa Al-Ash`ari was asked about the case when there was a daughter, grand-daughter and sister to inherit. He said, `The daughter gets one-half and the sister one-half.' Go and ask Ibn Mas`ud, although I think he is going to agree with me.' So Ibn Mas`ud was asked and was told about Abu Musa's answer, and Ibn Mas`ud commented, `I would have deviated then and would not have become among those who are rightly guided. I will give a judgment similar to the judgment given by the Prophet . The daughter gets one-half, the grand-daughter gets one-sixth, and these two shares will add up to two-thirds. Whatever is left will be for the sister.' We went back to Abu Musa and conveyed to him Ibn Mas`ud's answer and he said, `Do not ask me (for legal verdicts) as long as this scholar is still among you.\"' Allah then said,  وَهُوَ يَرِثُهَآ إِن لَّمْ يَكُنْ لَّهَآ وَلَدٌ  (... and he will be her heir if she has no children.) This Ayah means, the brother inherits all of that his sister leaves behind if she has no surviving offspring or parents. If she has a surviving parent, her brother would not inherit anything. If there is someone who gets a fixed share in the inheritance, such as a husband or half brother from the mother's side, they take their share and the rest goes to the brother. It is recorded in the Two Sahihs that Ibn `Abbas said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,  «ألْحِقُوا الْفَرَائِضَ بِأَهْلِهَا، فَمَا أَبْقَتِ الْفَرائِضُ فَلِأَوْلَى رَجُلٍ ذَكَر»  (Give the Farai'd to its people, and whatever is left is the share of the nearest male relative.) Allah said,  فَإِن كَانَتَا اثْنَتَيْنِ فَلَهُمَا الثُّلُثَانِ مِمَّا تَرَكَ  (If there are two sisters, they shall have two-thirds of the inheritance;) meaning, if the person who dies in Kalalah has two sisters, they get two-thirds of the inheritance. More than two sisters share in the two-thirds. From this Ayah, the scholars took the ruling regarding the two daughters, or more, that they share in the two-thirds, just as the share of the sisters (two or more) was taken from the Ayah about the daughters,  فَإِن كُنَّ نِسَآءً فَوْقَ اثْنَتَيْنِ فَلَهُنَّ ثُلُثَا مَا تَرَكَ  (if (there are) only daughters, two or more, their share is two thirds of the inheritance.) 4:11. Allah said,  وَإِن كَانُواْ إِخْوَةً رِّجَالاً وَنِسَآءً فَلِلذَّكَرِ مِثْلُ حَظِّ الاٍّنثَيَيْنِ  (if there are brothers and sisters, the male will have twice the share of the female.) This is the share that the male relatives (sons, grandsons, brothers) regularly get, that is, twice as much as the female gets. Allah said,  يُبَيِّنُ اللَّهُ لَكُمْ  ((Thus) does Allah make clear to you...) His Law and set limits, clarifying His legislation,  أَن تَضِلُّواْ  (Lest you go astray.) from the truth after this explanation,  وَاللَّهُ بِكُلِّ شَيْءٍ عَلِيمٌ  (And Allah is the All-Knower of everything.) Allah has perfect knowledge in the consequences of everything and in the benefit that each matter carries for His servants. He also knows what each of the relatives deserves from the inheritance, according to the degree of relation he or she has with the deceased. Ibn Jarir recorded that Tariq bin Shihab said that `Umar gathered the Companions of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ once and said, \"I will give a ruling concerning the Kalalah that even women will talk about it in their bedrooms.\" A snake then appeared in the house and the gathering had to disperse. `Umar commented, `Had Allah willed this (`Umar's verdict regarding the Kalalah) to happen, it would have happened.\" The chain of narration for this story is authentic. Al-Hakim, Abu `Abdullah An-Naysaburi recorded that `Umar bin Al-Khattab said, `Had I asked the Messenger of Allah ﷺ regarding three things, it would have been better for me than red camels. (They are:) who should be the Khalifah after him; about a people who said, `We agree to pay Zakah, but not to you (meaning to the Khalifah),' if we are allowed to fight them; and about the Kalalah.\" Al-Hakim said, \"Its chain is Sahih according to the Two Shaykhs, and they did not recorded it.\" Ibn Jarir also said that it was reported that `Umar said, \"I feel shy to change a ruling that Abu Bakr issued. Abu Bakr used to say that the Kalalah is the person who has no descendants or ascendants.\" Abu Bakr's saying is what the majority of scholars among the Companions, their followers and the earlier and later Imams agree with. This is also the ruling that the Qur'an indicates. For Allah stated that He has explained and made plain the ruling of the Kalalah, when He said,  يُبَيِّنُ اللَّهُ لَكُمْ أَن تَضِلُّواْ وَاللَّهُ بِكُلِّ شَىْءٍ عَلِيمٌ  ((Thus) does Allah makes clear to you (His Law) lest you go astray. And Allah is the All-Knower of everything.) And Allah knows best. "

  5,2,"<h2>Which was revealed in Al-Madina</h2><h2>The Virtues of Surat Al-Ma'idah; When It was Revealed</h2> At-Tirmidhi recorded that `Abdullah bin `Amr said, \"The last Surahs to be revealed were Surat Al-Ma'idah and Surat Al-Fath (chapter 48).\" At-Tirmidhi commented, \"This Hadith is Hasan, Gharib.\" and it was also reported that Ibn `Abbas said that the last Surah to be revealed was,  إِذَا جَآءَ نَصْرُ اللَّهِ وَالْفَتْحُ  (When there comes the help of Allah and the Conquest,) Al-Hakim collected a narration similar to that of At-Tirmidhi in his Mustadrak, and he said, \"It is Sahih according to the criteria of the Two Shaykhs and they did not record it.\" Al-Hakim narrated that Jubayr bin Nufayr said, \"I performed Hajj once and visited `A'ishah and she said to me, `O Jubayr! Do you read (or memorize) Al-Ma'idah ' I answered `Yes.' She said, `It was the last Surah to be revealed. Therefore, whatever permissible matters you find in it, then consider (treat) them permissible. And whatever impermissible matters you find in it, then consider (treat) them impermissible.\"' Al-Hakim said, \"It is Sahih according to the criteria of the Two Shaykhs and they did not record it. \" Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdur-Rahman bin Mahdi related that Mu`awiyah bin Salih added this statement in the last Hadith, \"I (Jubayr) also asked `A'ishah about the Messenger of Allah's ﷺ conduct and she answered by saying, `The Qur'an.\"' An-Nasa'i also recorded it.  بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ  In the Name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful.  Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that a man came to `Abdullah bin Mas`ud and said to him, \"Advise me.\" He said, \"When you hear Allah's statement,  يَـأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ  (O you who believe!) then pay full attention, for it is a righteous matter that He is ordaining or an evil thing that He is forbidding.\" Khaythamah said, \"Everything in the Qur'an that reads,  يَـأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ  (O you who believe!) reads in the Tawrah, `O you who are in need.\"' Allah said,  أَوْفُواْ بِالْعُقُودِ  (Fulfill (your) obligations.) Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid and others said that `obligations' here means treaties. Ibn Jarir mentioned that there is a consensus for this view. Ibn Jarir also said that it means treaties, such as the alliances that they used to conduct. `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas commented:  يَـأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ أَوْفُواْ بِالْعُقُودِ  (O you who believe! Fulfill (your) obligations.) \"Refers to the covenants, meaning, what Allah permitted, prohibited, ordained and set limits for in the Qur'an. Therefore, do not commit treachery or break the covenants. Allah emphasized this command when He said,  وَالَّذِينَ يَنقُضُونَ عَهْدَ اللَّهِ مِن بَعْدِ مِيثَـقِهِ وَيَقْطَعُونَ مَآ أَمَرَ اللَّهُ بِهِ أَن يُوصَلَ  (And those who break the covenant of Allah, after its ratification, and sever that which Allah has commanded to be joined,) until,  سُوءُ الدَّارِ  (unhappy (evil) home (i.e. Hell).)\" Ad-Dahhak said that,  أَوْفُواْ بِالْعُقُودِ  (Fulfill your obligations.) \"Refers to what Allah has permitted and what He has prohibited. Allah has taken the covenant from those who proclaim their faith in the Prophet and the Book to fulfill the obligations that He has ordered for them in the permissible and the impermissible.\" <h2>Explaining the Lawful and the Unlawful Beasts</h2> Allah said,  أُحِلَّتْ لَكُمْ بَهِيمَةُ الاٌّنْعَامِ  (Lawful to you (for food) are all the beasts of cattle) camels, cows and sheep, as Al-Hasan, Qatadah and several others stated. Ibn Jarir said that this Tafsir conforms to the meaning of (`beasts of cattle') that the Arabs had. We should mention that Ibn `Umar, Ibn `Abbas and others relied on this Ayah as evidence to allow eating the meat of the fetus if it is found dead in the belly of its slaughtered mother. There is a Hadith to the same effect collected in the Sunan of Abu Dawud, At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah and narrated by Abu Sa`id who said, \"We asked, `O Messenger of Allah! When we slaughter a camel, cow or sheep, we sometimes find a fetus in its belly, should we discard it or eat its meat' He said,  «كُلُوهُ إِنْ شِئْتُمْ فَإِنَّ ذَكَاتَهُ ذَكَاةُ أُمِّه»  (Eat it if you want, because its slaughter was fulfilled when its mother was slaughtered.)\" At-Tirmidhi said, \"This Hadith is Hasan.\" Abu Dawud recorded that Jabir bin `Abdullah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,  «ذَكَاةُ الْجَنِينِ ذَكَاةُ أُمِّه»  (Proper slaughter of the fetus is fulfilled with the slaughter of its mother.) Only Abu Dawud collected this narration. Allah's statement,  إِلاَّ مَا يُتْلَى عَلَيْكُمْ  (except that which will be announced to you (herein), ) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas said that it refers to, \"The flesh of dead animals, blood and the meat of swine.\" Qatadah said, \"The meat of dead animals and animals slaughtered without Allah's Name being pronounced at the time of slaughtering.\" It appears, and Allah knows best, that the Ayah refers to Allah's other statement,  حُرِّمَتْ عَلَيْكُمُ الْمَيْتَةُ وَالْدَّمُ وَلَحْمُ الْخِنْزِيرِ وَمَآ أُهِلَّ لِغَيْرِ اللَّهِ بِهِ وَالْمُنْخَنِقَةُ وَالْمَوْقُوذَةُ وَالْمُتَرَدِّيَةُ وَالنَّطِيحَةُ وَمَآ أَكَلَ السَّبُعُ  (Forbidden to you (for food) are: Al-Maytah (the dead animals), blood, the flesh of swine, and what has been slaughtered as a sacrifice for others than Allah, and that which has been killed by strangling, or by a violent blow, or by a headlong fall, or by the goring of horns - and that which has been (partly) eaten by a wild animal.)5:3, for although the animals mentioned in this Ayah are types of permissible cattle (except for swine), they become impermissible under the circumstances that the Ayah 5:3 specifies. This is why Allah said afterwards,  إِلاَّ مَا ذَكَّيْتُمْ وَمَا ذُبِحَ عَلَى النُّصُبِ  (Unless you are able to slaughter it (before its death) and that which is sacrificed (slaughtered) on An-Nusub (stone altars)) as the latter type is not permissible, because it can no longer be slaughtered properly. Hence, Allah's statement,  أُحِلَّتْ لَكُمْ بَهِيمَةُ الاٌّنْعَامِ إِلاَّ مَا يُتْلَى عَلَيْكُمْ  (Lawful to you are all the beasts of cattle except that which will be announced to you, ) means, except the specific circumstances that prohibit some of these which will be announced to you. Allah said,  غَيْرَ مُحِلِّى الصَّيْدِ وَأَنتُمْ حُرُمٌ  (game (also) being unlawful when you assume Ihram.) Some scholars said that the general meaning of `cattle' includes domesticated cattle, such as camels, cows and sheep, and wild cattle, such as gazzelle, wild cattle and wild donkeys. Allah made the exceptions mentioned above (dead animals blood, flesh of swine etc.), and prohibited hunting wild beasts while in the state of Ihram. It was also reported that the meaning here is, \"We have allowed for you all types of cattle in all circumstances, except what We excluded herewith for the one hunting game while in the state of Ihram.\" Allah said,  فَمَنِ اضْطُرَّ غَيْرَ بَاغٍ وَلاَ عَادٍ فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ  (But if one is forced by necessity, without willful disobedience, and not transgressing, then, Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.) This Ayah means, \"We allowed eating the meat of dead animals, when one is forced by necessity, under the condition that one is not transgressing the limits or overstepping them.\" Here, Allah states, \"Just as We allowed the meat of cattle in all conditions and circumstances, then do not hunt game when in the state of Ihram, for this is the decision of Allah, Who is the Most Wise in all that He commands and forbids.\" So Allah said;  إِنَّ اللَّهَ يَحْكُمُ مَا يُرِيدُ  (Verily, Allah commands that which He wills.) <h2>The Necessity of Observing the Sanctity of the Sacred Area and the Sacred Months</h2> Allah continues,  يَـأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ لاَ تُحِلُّواْ شَعَآئِرَ اللَّهِ  (O you who believe! Violate not the sanctity of Sha'a'ir Allah (the symbols of Allah),) Ibn `Abbas said, \"Sha`a'ir Allah means the rituals of Hajj.\" Mujahid said, \"As-Safa and Al-Marwah, and the sacrificial animal are the symbols of Allah.\" It was also stated that Sha`a'ir Allah is what He prohibited. Therefore, it means, do not violate what Allah prohibited. Allah said afterwards,  وَلاَ الشَّهْرَ الْحَرَامَ  (nor of the Sacred Month,) for you are required to respect and honor the Sacred Month and to refrain from what Allah forbade during it, such as fighting. This also lays emphasis on avoiding sins during that time. As Allah said;  يَسْـَلُونَكَ عَنِ الشَّهْرِ الْحَرَامِ قِتَالٍ فِيهِ قُلْ قِتَالٌ فِيهِ كَبِيرٌ  (They ask you concerning fighting in the Sacred Month. Say, \"Fighting therein is a great (transgression).\") and,  إِنَّ عِدَّةَ الشُّهُورِ عِندَ اللَّهِ اثْنَا عَشَرَ شَهْراً  (Verily, the number of months with Allah is twelve months (in a year). ) Al-Bukhari recorded in his Sahih that Abu Bakrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said during the Farewell Hajj,  «إِنَّ الزَّمَانَ قَدِ اسْتَدَارَ كَهَيْئَتِهِ يَوْمَ خَلَقَ اللهُ السَّمَواتِ وَالْأَرْضَ السَّنَةُ اثْنَا عَشَرَ شَهْرًا، مِنْهَا أَرْبَعَةٌ حُرُمٌ، ثَلَاثٌ مُتَوَالِيَاتٌ: ذُو الْقَعْدَةِ وَذُو الْحِجَّةِ وَالْمُحَرَّمُ، وَرَجَبُ مُضَرَ الَّذِي بَيْنَ جُمَادَى وَشَعْبَان»  (The division of time has returned as it was when Allah created the Heavens and the earth. The year is twelve months, four of which are sacred: Three are in succession, (they are:) Dhul-Qa'dah, Dhul-Hijjah and Muharram, and (the fourth is) Rajab of (the tribe of) Mudar which comes between Jumada (Ath-Thaniyah) and Sha'ban.) This Hadith testifies to the continued sanctity of these months until the end of time. <h2>Taking the Hady to the Sacred House of Allah, Al-Ka`bah</h2> Allah's statement,  وَلاَ الْهَدْىَ وَلاَ الْقَلَـئِدَ  (nor of the Hady brought for sacrifice, nor the garlands,) means, do not abandon the practice of bringing the Hady (sacrificial animals) to the Sacred House, as this ritual is a form of honoring the symbols of Allah. Do not abandon the practice of garlanding these animals on their necks, so that they are distinguished from other cattle. This way, it will be known that these animals are intended to be offered as Hady at the Ka`bah, and thus those who might intend some harm to them would refrain from doing so. Those who see the Hady might be encouraged to imitate this ritual, and indeed, he who calls to a type of guidance, will earn rewards equal to the rewards of those who follow his lead, without decrease in their own rewards. When the Messenger of Allah ﷺ intended to perform Hajj, he spent the night at Dhul-Hulayfah, which is also called Wadi Al-`Aqiq. In the morning, the Prophet made rounds with his wives, who were nine at that time, performed Ghusl (bath), applied some perfume and performed a two Rak`ah prayer. He then garlanded the Hady and announced aloud his intention to perform Hajj and `Umrah. The Prophet's Hady at the time consisted of plenty of camels, more than sixty, and they were among the best animals, the healthiest and most physically acceptable, just as Allah's statement proclaims,  ذلِكَ وَمَن يُعَظِّمْ شَعَـئِرَ اللَّهِ فَإِنَّهَا مِن تَقْوَى الْقُلُوبِ  (Thus it is, and whosoever honors the symbols of Allah, then it is truly, from the piety of the hearts.) Muqatil bin Hayyan said that Allah's statement,  وَلاَ الْقَلَـئِدَ  (nor the garlands) means, \"Do not breach their sanctity.\" During the time of Jahiliyyah, the people used to garland themselves with animal hair and pelts when they left their areas in months other than the Sacred Months. The idolators of the Sacred House Area used to garland themselves with the tree-stems of the Sacred Area, so that they were granted safe passage.\" This statement was collected by Ibn Abi Hatim, who also recorded that Ibn `Abbas said, \"There are two Ayat in this Surah (Al-Ma'idah) that were abrogated, the Ayah about the garlands 5:2, and  فَإِن جَآءُوكَ فَاحْكُمْ بَيْنَهُمْ أَوْ أَعْرِضْ عَنْهُمْ  (So if they come to you (O Muhammad ), either judge between them, or turn away from them.)\" <h2>The Necessity of Preserving the Sanctity and Safety of those who Intend to Travel to the Sacred House</h2> Allah said,  وَلا ءَامِّينَ الْبَيْتَ الْحَرَامَ يَبْتَغُونَ فَضْلاً مِّن رَّبِّهِمْ وَرِضْوَناً  (nor the people coming to the Sacred House (Makkah), seeking the bounty and good pleasure of their Lord.) The Ayah commands: Do not fight people who are heading towards the Sacred House of Allah, which if anyone enters it, he must be granted safe refuge. Likewise, those who are heading towards the Sacred House seeking the bounty and good pleasure of Allah, must not be stopped, prevented, or frightened away from entering the Sacred House. Mujahid, `Ata', Abu Al-`Aliyah, Mutarrif bin `Abdullah, `Abdullah bin `Ubayd bin `Umayr, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, Muqatil bin Hayyan, Qatadah and several others said that,  يَبْتَغُونَ فَضْلاً مِّن رَّبِّهِمْ  (seeking the bounty of their Lord.) refers to trading. A similar discussion preceded concerning the Ayah;  لَيْسَ عَلَيْكُمْ جُنَاحٌ أَن تَبْتَغُواْ فَضْلاً مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ  (There is no sin on you if you seek the bounty of your Lord (during pilgrimage by trading).) Allah said;  وَرِضْوَناً  (and pleasure. ) Ibn `Abbas said that the word `pleasure' in the Ayah refers to, \"seeking Allah's pleasure by their Hajj.\" `Ikrimah, As-Suddi and Ibn Jarir mentioned that this Ayah was revealed concerning Al-Hutam bin Hind Al-Bakri, who had raided the cattle belonging to the people of Al-Madinah. The following year, he wanted to perform `Umrah to the House of Allah and some of the Companions wanted to attack him on his way to the House. Allah revealed,  وَلا ءَامِّينَ الْبَيْتَ الْحَرَامَ يَبْتَغُونَ فَضْلاً مِّن رَّبِّهِمْ وَرِضْوَناً  (nor the people coming to the Sacred House (Makkah), seeking the bounty and good pleasure of their Lord.) <h2>Hunting Game is Permissible After Ihram Ends</h2> Allah said,  وَإِذَا حَلَلْتُمْ فَاصْطَـدُواْ  (But when you finish the Ihram, then hunt,) When you end your Ihram, it is permitted for you to hunt game, which was prohibited for you during Ihram. Although this Ayah contains a command that takes effect after the end of a state of prohibition (during Ihram in this case), the Ayah, in fact, brings back the ruling that was previously in effect. If the previous ruling was an obligation, the new command will uphold that obligation, and such is the case with recommended and permissible matters. There are many Ayat that deny that the ruling in such cases is always an obligation. Such is also the case against those who say that it is always merely allowed. What we mentioned here is the correct opinion that employs the available evidence, and Allah knows best. <h2>Justice is Always Necessary</h2> Allah said,  وَلاَ يَجْرِمَنَّكُمْ شَنَآنُ قَوْمٍ أَن صَدُّوكُمْ عَنِ الْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ أَن تَعْتَدُواْ  (and let not the hatred of some people in (once) stopping you from Al-Masjid Al-Haram (at Makkah) lead you to transgression (and hostility on your part).) The meaning of this Ayah is apparent, as it commands: Let not the hatred for some people, who prevented you from reaching the Sacred House in the year of Hudaybiyyah, make you transgress Allah's Law and commit injustice against them in retaliation. Rather, rule as Allah has commanded you, being just with every one. We will explain a similar Ayah later on,  وَلاَ يَجْرِمَنَّكُمْ شَنَآنُ قَوْمٍ عَلَى أَلاَّ تَعْدِلُواْ اعْدِلُواْ هُوَ أَقْرَبُ لِلتَّقْوَى  (And let not the enmity and hatred of others make you avoid justice. Be just: that is nearer to piety,) which commands: do not be driven by your hatred for some people into abandoning justice, for justice is ordained for everyone, in all situations. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Zayd bin Aslam said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ and his Companions were in the area of Al-Hudaybiyyah when the idolators prevented them from visiting the House, and that was especially hard on them. Later on, some idolators passed by them from the east intending to perform `Umrah. So the Companions of the Prophet said, `Let us prevent those (from `Umrah) just as their fellow idolators prevented us.' Thereafter, Allah sent down this Ayah.\" Ibn Abbas and others said that \"Shana'an\" refers to enmity and hate. Allah said next,  وَتَعَاوَنُواْ عَلَى الْبرِّ وَالتَّقْوَى وَلاَ تَعَاوَنُواْ عَلَى الإِثْمِ وَالْعُدْوَانِ  (Help you one another in Al-Birr and At-Taqwa; but do not help one another in sin and transgression.) Allah commands His believing servants to help one another perform righteous, good deeds, which is the meaning of `Al-Birr', and to avoid sins, which is the meaning of `At-Taqwa'. Allah forbids His servants from helping one another in sin, `Ithm' and committing the prohibitions. Ibn Jarir said that, \"Ithm means abandoning what Allah has ordained, while transgression means overstepping the limits that Allah set in your religion, along with overstepping what Allah has ordered concerning yourselves and others.\" Imam Ahmad recorded that Anas bin Malik said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,  «انْصُرْ أَخَاكَ ظَالِمًا أَوْ مَظْلُومًا»  (Support your brother whether he was unjust or the victim of injustice.) He was asked, \"O Messenger of Allah! We know about helping him when he suffers injustice, so what about helping him when he commits injustice\" He said,  «تَحْجُزُهُ وَتَمْنَعُهُ مِنَ الظُّلْمِ فَذَاكَ نَصْرُه»  (Prevent and stop him from committing injustice, and this represents giving support to him.) Al-Bukhari recorded this Hadith through Hushaym. Ahmad recorded that one of the Companions of the Prophet narrated the Hadith,  «الْمُؤْمِنُ الَّذِي يُخَالِطُ النَّاسَ وَيَصْبِرُ عَلَى أَذَاهُمْ أَعْظَمُ أَجْرًا مِنَ الَّذِي لَا يُخَالِطُ النَّاسَ وَلَا يَصْبِرُ عَلى أَذَاهُم»  (The believer who mingles with people and is patient with their annoyance, earns more reward than the believer who does not mingle with people and does not observe patience with their annoyance.) Muslim recorded a Hadith that states,  «مَنْ دَعَا إِلَى هُدًى كَانَ لَهُ مِنَ الْأَجْرِ مِثْلُ أُجُورِ مَنِ اتَّبَعَهُ إِلى يَوْمِ الْقِيَامَةِ لَا يَنْقُصُ ذلِكَ مِنْ أُجُورِهِمْ شَيْئًا، وَمَنْ دَعَا إِلَى ضَلَالَةٍ كَانَ عَلَيْهِ مِنَ الْإِثْمِ مِثْلُ آثَامِ مَنِ اتَّبَعَهُ إِلَى يَوْمِ الْقِيَامَةِ، لَا يَنْقُصُ ذلِكَ مِنْ آثَامِهِمْ شَيْئًا»  (He who calls to a guidance, will earn a reward similar to the rewards of those who accept his call, until the Day of Resurrection, without decreasing their rewards. Whoever calls to a heresy, will carry a burden similar to the burdens of those who accept his call, until the Day of Resurrection, without decreasing their own burdens.) "
