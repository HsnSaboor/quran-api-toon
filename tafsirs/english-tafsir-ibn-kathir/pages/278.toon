  16,96,"<h2>If Allah had willed, He would have made all of Humanity one Nation</h2> Allah says:  ﴾وَلَوْ شَآءَ اللَّهُ لَجَعَلَكُمْ﴿ (And had Allah willed, He would have made you) meaning - O mankind,  ﴾أُمَّةً وَحِدَةً﴿ ((all) one nation,) This is like the Ayah:  ﴾وَلَوْ شَآءَ رَبُّكَ لآمَنَ مَن فِى الاٌّرْضِ كُلُّهُمْ جَمِيعًا﴿ (And had your Lord willed, all of those on earth would have believed together.) 10:99, meaning, He could have created harmony among them, and there would not be any differences, conflicts or hatred between them.  ﴾وَلَوْ شَآءَ رَبُّكَ لَجَعَلَ النَّاسَ أُمَّةً وَاحِدَةً وَلاَ يَزَالُونَ مُخْتَلِفِينَ ﴿﴾إِلاَّ مَن رَّحِمَ رَبُّكَ وَلِذلِكَ خَلَقَهُمْ﴿ (And if your Lord had so willed, He would surely, have made mankind one Ummah nation or community, but they will not cease to disagree. Except him on whom your Lord has bestowed His mercy, and for that did He create them.) (11:118-119) Similarly, Allah says here:  ﴾وَلـكِن يُضِلُّ مَن يَشَآءُ وَيَهْدِى مَن يَشَآءُ﴿ (but He allows whom He wills to stray and He guides whom He wills. ) Then on the Day of Resurrection, He will ask them all about their deeds, and will reward or punish them even equal to a scalish thread in the long slit of a date stone or the size of a speck on the back of a date stone, or even a thin membrane of the date stone. <h2>The Prohibition on taking an Oath for Purposes of Treachery</h2> Then Allah warns His servant against taking oaths as means of deception, i.e., using them for treacherous purposes, lest a foot should slip after being firmly planted. This is an analogy describing one who was on the right path but then deviated and slipped from the path of guidance because of an unfulfilled oath that involved hindering people from the path of Allah. This is because if a disbeliever were to find that after having agreed to a covenant, then the believer betrayed him, then the believer will have hindered him from entering Islam. Thus Allah says:  ﴾وَتَذُوقُواْ الْسُّوءَ بِمَا صَدَدتُّمْ عَن سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ وَلَكُمْ عَذَابٌ عَظِيمٌ﴿ (and you taste the evil of having hindered from the path of Allah, and you will suffer a terrible punishment.) <h2>Do not break Oaths for the sake of Worldly Gain</h2> Then Allah says:  ﴾وَلاَ تَشْتَرُواْ بِعَهْدِ اللَّهِ ثَمَناً قَلِيلاً﴿ (And do not use an oath by Allah for the purchase of little value.) meaning, do not neglect an oath sworn in the Name of Allah for the sake of this world and its attractions, for they are few, and even if the son of Adam were to gain this world and all that is in it, that which is with Allah is better for him, i.e., the reward of Allah is better for the one who puts his hope in Him, believes in Him, seeks Him and fulfills his oaths in the hope of that which Allah has promised. This is why Allah says:  ﴾إِن كُنتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَمَا عِندَكُمْ يَنفَدُ﴿ (if you only knew. Whatever you have will be exhausted,) meaning, it will come to an end and will vanish, because it is only there for a certain, limited time.  ﴾وَمَا عِندَ اللَّهِ بَاقٍ﴿ (and what is with Allah will remain.) meaning, His reward for you in Paradise will remain, without interruption or end, because it is eternal and will never change nor disappear.  ﴾وَلَنَجْزِيَنَّ الَّذِينَ صَبَرُواْ أَجْرَهُمْ بِأَحْسَنِ مَا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ﴿ (And to those who are patient, We will certainly grant them their rewards in proportion to the best of what they used to do. ) Here the Lord swears, with the Lam of affirmation, that He will reward the patient for the best of their deeds, i.e., He will forgive them for their bad deeds.  "
  16,97,"<h2>Righteous Deeds and their Reward</h2> This is a promise from Allah to those Children of Adam, male or female, who do righteous deeds - deeds in accordance with the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Prophet , with a heart that believes in Allah and His Messenger , while believing that these deeds are commanded and enjoined by Allah. Allah promises that He will give them a good life in this world and that He will reward them according to the best of their deeds in the Hereafter. The good life includes feeling tranquillity in all aspects of life. It has been reported that Ibn `Abbas and a group (of scholars) interpreted it to mean good, lawful provisions. It was reported that `Ali bin Abi Talib interpreted as contentment. This was also the opinion of Ibn `Abbas, `Ikrimah and Wahb bin Munabbih. `Ali bin Abi Talhah recorded from Ibn `Abbas that it meant happiness. Al-Hasan, Mujahid and Qatadah said: \"None gets this good life mentioned except in Paradise.\" Ad-Dahhak said: \"It means lawful provisions and worship in this life\". Ad-Dahhak also said: \"It means working to obey Allah and finding joy in that.\" The correct view is that a good life includes all of these things. as found in the Hadith recorded by Imam Ahmad from `Abdullah bin `Amr that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:  «قَدْ أَفْلَحَ مَنْ أَسْلَمَ، وَرُزِقَ كَفَافًا، وَقَنَّعَهُ اللهُ بِمَا آتَاه»  (He who submits becomes a Muslim has succeeded, is given sufficient provisions, and is content with Allah for what he is given.) It was also recorded by Muslim.  فَإِذَا قَرَأْتَ الْقُرْءَانَ فَاسْتَعِذْ بِاللَّهِ مِنَ الشَّيْطَـنِ الرَّجِيمِ "

  16,100,"<h2>The Command to seek Refuge with Allah before reciting the Qur'an</h2> This is a command from Allah to His servants upon the tongue of His Prophet , telling them that when they want to read Qur'an, they should seek refuge with Allah from the cursed Shaytan. The Hadiths mentioned about seeking refuge with Allah (Isti`adhah), were quoted in our discussion at the beginning of this Tafsir, praise be to Allah. The reason for seeking refuge with Allah before reading is that the reader should not get confused or mixed up, and that the Shaytan would not confuse him or stop him from thinking about and pondering over the meaning of what he reads. Hence the majority of scholars said that refuge should be sought with Allah before starting to read.  ﴾إِنَّهُ لَيْسَ لَهُ سُلْطَانٌ عَلَى الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَعَلَى رَبِّهِمْ يَتَوَكَّلُونَ ﴿ (Verily, he has no power over those who believe and put their trust only in their Lord.) Ath-Thawri said: \"He has no power to make them commit a sin they will not repent from.\" Others said: it means that he has no argument for them. Others said it is like the Ayah:  ﴾إِلاَّ عِبَادَكَ مِنْهُمُ الْمُخْلَصِينَ ﴿ (Except Your chosen servants amongst them.) 15:40  ﴾إِنَّمَا سُلْطَـنُهُ عَلَى الَّذِينَ يَتَوَلَّوْنَهُ﴿ (His power is only over those who obey and follow him (Shaytan), ) Mujahid said: \"Those who obey him.\" Others said, \"Those who take him as their protector instead of Allah.\"  ﴾وَالَّذِينَ هُم بِهِ مُشْرِكُونَ﴿ (and those who join partners with Him.) means, those who associate others in worship with Allah.  "

  16,102,"<h2>The Idolators' Accusation that the Prophet was a Liar since some Ayat were abrogated, and the Refutation of their Claim</h2> Allah tells us of the weak minds of the idolators, and their lack of faith and conviction. He explains that it is impossible for them to have faith when He has decreed that they are doomed. When they saw that some rulings had been changed by being abrogated, they said to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ:  إِنَّمَآ أَنتَ مُفْتَرٍ  (You are but a forger) meaning one who tells lies. But Allah is the Lord Who does whatever He wills, and rules as He wants.  بَدَّلْنَآ ءَايَةً مَّكَانَ ءَايَةٍ  (And when We change a verse (of the Qur'an) in place of another) Mujahid said: this means, \"We remove one and put another in its place.\" Qatadah said: this is like the Ayah:  مَا نَنسَخْ مِنْ ءَايَةٍ أَوْ نُنسِهَا  (Whatever verse We change abrogate or omit the abrogated...)\" (2:106). Allah said, in response to them:  قُلْ نَزَّلَهُ رُوحُ الْقُدُسِ  (Say: \"Ruh-ul-Qudus has brought it...\") meaning, Jibril,  مِّن رَّبِّكَ بِالْحَقِّ  (from your Lord with truth, ) meaning, with truthfulness and justice  لِيُثَبِّتَ الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ  (for the conviction of those who believe,) so that they will believe what was revealed earlier and what was revealed later, and humble themselves towards Allah.  وَهُدًى وَبُشْرَى لِلْمُسْلِمِينَ  (and as a guide and good news for the Muslims.) meaning He has made it a guide and good news to the Muslims who believe in Allah and His Messengers.
