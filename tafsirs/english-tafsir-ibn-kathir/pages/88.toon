  4,63,"<h2>Referring to Other than the Qur'an and Sunnah for Judgment is Characteristic of Non-Muslims</h2> Allah chastises those who claim to believe in what Allah has sent down to His Messenger and to the earlier Prophets, yet they refer to other than the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Messenger for judgment in various disputes. It was reported that the reason behind revealing this Ayah was that a man from the Ansar and a Jew had a dispute, and the Jew said, \"Let us refer to Muhammad to judge between us.\" However, the Muslim man said, \"Let us refer to Ka`b bin Al-Ashraf (a Jew) to judge between us.\" It was also reported that the Ayah was revealed about some hypocrites who pretended to be Muslims, yet they sought to refer to the judgment of Jahiliyyah. Other reasons were also reported behind the revelation of the Ayah. However, the Ayah has a general meaning, as it chastises all those who refrain from referring to the Qur'an and Sunnah for judgment and prefer the judgment of whatever they chose of falsehood, which befits the description of Taghut here. This is why Allah said, ﴾يُرِيدُونَ أَن يَتَحَاكَمُواْ إِلَى الطَّـغُوتِ﴿ (and they wish to go for judgment to the Taghut) until the end of the Ayah. Allah's statement, ﴾يَصُدُّونَ عَنكَ صُدُوداً﴿ (turn away from you with aversion) means, they turn away from you in arrogance, just as Allah described the polytheists, ﴾وَإِذَا قِيلَ لَهُمُ اتَّبِعُواْ مَآ أَنزَلَ اللَّهُ قَالُواْ بَلْ نَتَّبِعُ مَا وَجَدْنَا عَلَيْهِ ءَابَآءَنَا﴿ (When it is said to them: \"Follow what Allah has sent down.\" They say: \"Nay! We shall follow what we found our fathers following.\") This is different from the conduct of the faithful believers, whom Allah describes as, ﴾إِنَّمَا كَانَ قَوْلَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ إِذَا دُعُواْ إِلَى اللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ لِيَحْكُمَ بَيْنَهُمْ أَن يَقُولُواْ سَمِعْنَا وَأَطَعْنَا﴿ (The only saying of the faithful believers, when they are called to Allah and His Messenger, to judge between them, is that they say: \"We hear and we obey.\") <h2>Chastising the Hypocrites</h2> Chastising the hypocrites, Allah said, ﴾فَكَيْفَ إِذَآ أَصَـبَتْهُمْ مُّصِيبَةٌ بِمَا قَدَّمَتْ أَيْدِيهِمْ﴿ (How then, when a catastrophe befalls them because of what their hands have sent forth,) meaning, how about it if they feel compelled to join you because of disasters that they suffer due to their sins, then they will be in need of you. ﴾ثُمَّ جَآءُوكَ يَحْلِفُونَ بِاللَّهِ إِنْ أَرَدْنَآ إِلاَّ إِحْسَاناً وَتَوْفِيقاً﴿ (They come to you swearing by Allah, \"We meant no more than goodwill and conciliation!\") apologizing and swearing that they only sought goodwill and reconciliation when they referred to other than the Prophet for judgment, not that they believe in such alternative judgment, as they claim. Allah describes these people to us further in His statement, ﴾فَتَرَى الَّذِينَ فِى قُلُوبِهِم مَّرَضٌ يُسَـرِعُونَ فِيهِمْ يَقُولُونَ نَخْشَى﴿ (And you see those in whose hearts there is a disease (of hypocrisy), they hurry to their friendship, saying: \"We fear\"), until, ﴾فَيُصْبِحُواْ عَلَى مَآ أَسَرُّواْ فِى أَنفُسِهِمْ نَـدِمِينَ﴿ (Then they will become regretful for what they have been keeping as a secret in themselves). At-Tabarani recorded that Ibn `Abbas said, \"Abu Barzah Al-Aslami used to be a soothsayer who judged between the Jews in their disputes. When some Muslims came to him to judge between them, Allah sent down, ﴾أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى الَّذِينَ يَزْعُمُونَ أَنَّهُمْ ءَامَنُواْ بِمَآ أُنزِلَ إِلَيْكَ وَمَآ أُنزِلَ مِن قَبْلِكَ﴿ (Have you not seen those (hyprocrites) who claim that they believe in that which has been sent down to you, and that which was sent down before you), until, ﴾إِنْ أَرَدْنَآ إِلاَّ إِحْسَاناً وَتَوْفِيقاً﴿ (\"We meant no more than goodwill and conciliation!\") Allah then said, ﴾أُولَـئِكَ الَّذِينَ يَعْلَمُ اللَّهُ مَا فِى قُلُوبِهِمْ﴿ (They (hypocrites) are those of whom Allah knows what is in their hearts;) These people are hypocrites, and Allah knows what is in their hearts and will punish them accordingly, for nothing escapes Allah's watch. Consequently, O Muhammad! Let Allah be sufficient for you in this regard, because He has perfect knowledge of their apparent and hidden affairs. This is why Allah said, ﴾فَأَعْرِضْ عَنْهُمْ﴿ (so turn aside from them (do not punish them)) meaning, do not punish them because of what is in their hearts. ﴾وَعِظْهُمْ﴿ (but admonish them) means, advise them against the hypocrisy and evil that reside in their hearts, ﴾وَقُل لَّهُمْ فِى أَنفُسِهِمْ قَوْلاً بَلِيغاً﴿ (and speak to them an effective word to reach their inner selves) advise them, between you and them, using effective words that might benefit them.

  4,65,"<h2>The Necessity of Obeying the Messenger ﷺ</h2> Allah said,  وَمَآ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن رَّسُولٍ إلاَّ لِيُطَاعَ  (We sent no Messenger, but to be obeyed) meaning, obeying the Prophet was ordained for those to whom Allah sends the Prophet. Allah's statement,  بِإِذُنِ اللَّهِ  (by Allah's leave) means, \"None shall obey, except by My leave,\" according to Mujahid. This Ayah indicates that the Prophets are only obeyed by whomever Allah directs to obedience. In another Ayah, Allah said,  وَلَقَدْ صَدَقَكُمُ اللَّهُ وَعْدَهُ إِذْ تَحُسُّونَهُمْ بِإِذْنِهِ  (And Allah did indeed fulfill His promise to you when you were killing them (your enemy) with His permission) meaning, by His command, decree, will and because He granted you superiority over them. Allah's statement,  وَلَوْ أَنَّهُمْ إِذ ظَّلَمُواْ أَنفُسَهُمْ  (If they (hypocrites), when they had been unjust to themselves,) directs the sinners and evildoers, when they commit errors and mistakes, to come to the Messenger ﷺ, so that they ask Allah for forgiveness in his presence and ask him to supplicate to Allah to forgive them. If they do this, Allah will forgive them and award them His mercy and pardon. This is why Allah said,  لَوَجَدُواْ اللَّهَ تَوَّاباً رَّحِيماً  (they would have found Allah All-Forgiving (One Who forgives and accepts repentance), Most Merciful). <h2>One Does not Become a Believer Unless He Refers to the Messenger ﷺ for Judgment and Submits to his Decisions</h2> Allah said,  فَلاَ وَرَبِّكَ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ حَتَّى يُحَكِّمُوكَ فِيمَا شَجَرَ بَيْنَهُمْ  (But no, by your Lord, they can have no faith, until they make you judge in all disputes between them,) Allah swears by His Glorious, Most Honorable Self, that no one shall attain faith until he refers to the Messenger ﷺ for judgment in all matters. Thereafter, whatever the Messenger ﷺ commands, is the plain truth that must be submitted to inwardly and outwardly. Allah said,  ثُمَّ لاَ يَجِدُواْ فِى أَنفُسِهِمْ حَرَجاً مِّمَّا قَضَيْتَ وَيُسَلِّمُواْ تَسْلِيماً  (and find in themselves no resistance against your decisions, and accept (them) with full submission.) meaning: they adhere to your judgment, and thus do not feel any hesitation over your decision, and they submit to it inwardly and outwardly. They submit to the Prophet's decision with total submission without any rejection, denial or dispute. Al-Bukhari recorded that `Urwah said, \"Az-Zubayr quarreled with a man about a stream which both of them used for irrigation. Allah's Messenger ﷺ said to Az-Zubayr,  «اسْقِ يَا زُبَيْرُ ثُمَّ أَرْسِلِ الْمَاءَ إِلى جَارِك»  (O Zubayr! Irrigate (your garden) first, and then let the water flow to your neighbor.) The Ansari became angry and said, `O Allah's Messenger! Is it because he is your cousin' On that, the face of Allah's Messenger changed color (because of anger) and said,  «اسْقِ يَا زُبَيْرُ ثُمَّ احْبِسِ الْمَاءَ حَتَّى يَرْجِعَ إِلَى الْجَدْرِ،ثُمَّ أَرْسِلِ الْمَاءَ إِلى جَارِك»  (Irrigate (your garden), O Zubayr, and then withhold the water until it reaches the walls (surrounding the palms). Then, release the water to your neighbor.) So, Allah's Messenger ﷺ gave Az-Zubayr his full right when the Ansari made him angry. Before that, Allah's Messenger ﷺ had given a generous judgment, beneficial for Az-Zubayr and the Ansari. Az-Zubayr said, `I think the following verse was revealed concerning that case,  فَلاَ وَرَبِّكَ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ حَتَّى يُحَكِّمُوكَ فِيمَا شَجَرَ بَيْنَهُمْ  (But no, by your Lord, they can have no faith, until they make you (O Muhammad ) judge in all disputes between them.)\"' Another Reason In his Tafsir, Al-Hafiz Abu Ishaq Ibrahim bin `Abdur-Rahman bin Ibrahim bin Duhaym recorded that Damrah narrated that two men took their dispute to the Prophet , and he gave a judgment to the benefit of whoever among them had the right. The person who lost the dispute said, \"I do not agree.\" The other person asked him, \"What do you want then\" He said, \"Let us go to Abu Bakr As-Siddiq.\" They went to Abu Bakr and the person who won the dispute said, \"We went to the Prophet with our dispute and he issued a decision in my favor.\" Abu Bakr said, \"Then the decision is that which the Messenger of Allah ﷺ issued.\" The person who lost the dispute still rejected the decision and said, \"Let us go to `Umar bin Al-Khattab.\" When they went to `Umar, the person who won the dispute said, \"We took our dispute to the Prophet and he decided in my favor, but this man refused to submit to the decision.\" `Umar bin Al-Khattab asked the second man and he concurred. `Umar went to his house and emerged from it holding aloft his sword. He struck the head of the man who rejected the Prophet's decision with the sword and killed him. Consequently, Allah revealed,  فَلاَ وَرَبِّكَ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ  (But no, by your Lord, they can have no faith). "
