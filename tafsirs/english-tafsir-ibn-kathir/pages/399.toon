  29,25,"<h2>The Response of Ibrahim's People -- and how Allah controlled the Fire</h2> Allah tells us how Ibrahim's people stubbornly and arrogantly disbelieved, and how they resisted the truth with falsehood. After Ibrahim addressed them with his words of clear guidance, ﴾إِلاَّ أَن قَالُواْ اقْتُلُوهُ أَوْ حَرِّقُوهُ﴿ (except that they said: \"Kill him or burn him.\") This was because proof had clearly been established against them, so they resorted to using their power and strength. ﴾قَالُواْ ابْنُواْ لَهُ بُنْيَـناً فَأَلْقُوهُ فِى الْجَحِيمِ - فَأَرَادُواْ بِهِ كَيْداً فَجَعَلْنَـهُمُ الاٌّسْفَلِينَ ﴿ (They said: \"Build for him a building and throw him into the blazing fire!\" So they plotted a plot against him, but We made them the lowest.) (37:97-98). They spent a long time gathering a huge amount of firewood, they built a fence around it, then they set it ablaze until its flames reached up to the sky. No greater fire had ever been lit. Then they went to Ibrahim, seized him and put him into a catapult, then they threw him into the fire. But Allah made it cool and safe for him, and after spending several days in it, he emerged unscathed. For this reason and others, Allah made him an Imam for mankind, for he offered himself to the Most Merciful, he offered his body to the flames, he offered his son as a sacrifice, and he gave his wealth to care for his guests. For all of these reasons he is beloved by the followers of all religions. ﴾فَأَنْجَاهُ اللَّهُ مِنَ النَّارِ﴿ (Then Allah saved him from the fire. ) means, He rescued him from it by making it cool and safe for him. ﴾إِنَّ فِى ذلِكَ لآيَـتٍ لِّقَوْمٍ يُؤْمِنُونَ﴿ (Verily, in this are indeed signs for a people who believe.) Ibrahim, peace be upon him, explains to his people that idols are incapable of doing anything, ﴾وَقَالَ إِنَّمَا اتَّخَذْتُمْ مِّن دُونِ اللَّهِ أَوْثَـناً مَّوَدَّةَ بَيْنِكُمْ فِى الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا﴿ (And (Ibrahim) said: \"You have taken idols instead of Allah. The love between you is only in the life of this world,) Here Ibrahim was rebuking his people for their evil deed of worshipping idols, and telling them: `You have taken these as gods and you come together to worship them so that there is friendship and love among you in this world,' ﴾ثُمَّ يَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ﴿ (but on the Day of Resurrection,) the situation will be the opposite, and this love and friendship will turn into hatred and enmity. Then ﴾يَكْفُرُ بَعْضُكُمْ بِبَعْضٍ﴿ (you shall deny each other,) meaning, `you will denounce one another and deny whatever was between you,' ﴾وَيَلْعَنُ بَعْضُكُمْ بَعْضاً﴿ (and curse each other, ) means, the followers will curse their leaders and the leaders will curse their followers. ﴾كُلَّمَا دَخَلَتْ أُمَّةٌ لَّعَنَتْ أُخْتَهَا﴿ a(Every time a new nation enters (the Fire), it curses its sister nation (that went before)) (7:37). ﴾الاٌّخِلاَءُ يَوْمَئِذٍ بَعْضُهُمْ لِبَعْضٍ عَدُوٌّ إِلاَّ الْمُتَّقِينَ ﴿ (Friends on that Day will be foes one to another except those who have Taqwa.) (43:67) And Allah says here: ﴾ثُمَّ يَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ يَكْفُرُ بَعْضُكُمْ بِبَعْضٍ وَيَلْعَنُ بَعْضُكُمْ بَعْضاً وَمَأْوَاكُمُ النَّارُ﴿ (but on the Day of Resurrection, you shall deny each other, and curse each other, and your abode will be the Fire,) meaning, `your ultimate destiny after all accounts have been settled, will be the fire of Hell, and you will have no one to help you or save you from the punishment of Allah.' This will be the state of the disbelievers. As for the believers, it will be an entirely different matter. "

  29,27,"<h2>The Faith of Lut and His Emigration with Ibrahim</h2> Allah tells us that Lut believed in Ibrahim. It was said that he was the son of Ibrahim's brother, and that his name was Lut bin Haran bin Azar. None of Ibrahim's people believed in Ibrahim besides Lut and Sarah the wife of Ibrahim. But if it is asked how we may reconcile this Ayah with the Hadith narrated in the Sahih which says that when Ibrahim passed by that tyrant and he asked about Sarah and what her relationship was to him, Ibrahim said, \"My sister.\" Then he went to her and said, \"I told him that you are my sister, so do not let him think I am lying, for there are no believers on earth except for you and I, and you are my sister in faith.\" It seems -- and Allah knows best -- that the meaning here is, there is no other Muslim couple on earth apart from you and I. Among his people, only Lut believed in him and migrated with him to Syria, then during Ibrahim's lifetime he was sent as a Messenger to the people of Sadum (Sodom) where he settled. We have already discussed their story and more is to come. ﴾وَقَالَ إِنِّى مُهَاجِرٌ إِلَى رَبِّى﴿ (He (Ibrahim) said: \"I will emigrate for the sake of my Lord.\") It may be that the pronoun in the verb \"he said\" refers to Lut, because he was the last person mentioned before this phrase; or it may refer to Ibrahim. Ibn `Abbas and Ad-Dahhak said that Ibrahim is the one who is referred in the phrase. ﴾فَـَامَنَ لَهُ لُوطٌ﴿ (So, Lut believed in him.) i.e., out of all his people. Then Allah tells us that he chose to leave them so that he might be able to follow his religion openly. So he said: ﴾إِنَّهُ هُوَ الْعَزِيزُ الْحَكِيمُ﴿ (Verily, He is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.) Power belongs to Him and to His Messenger and to those who believe in him, and He is Wise in all that He says and does, and in all His rulings and decrees, both universal and legislative. Qatadah said, \"They migrated together from Kutha, which is on the outskirts of Kufa, and went to Syria.\" Allah gave Ibrahim, Ishaq and Ya`qub, and ordained Prophethood in His Offspring ﴾وَوَهَبْنَا لَهُ إِسْحَـقَ وَيَعْقُوبَ﴿ (And We bestowed on him, Ishaq and Ya`qub,) This is like the Ayah, ﴾فَلَمَّا اعْتَزَلَهُمْ وَمَا يَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ وَهَبْنَا لَهُ إِسْحَـقَ وَيَعْقُوبَ وَكُلاًّ جَعَلْنَا نَبِيّاً ﴿ (So, when he had turned away from them and from those whom they worshipped besides Allah, We gave him Ishaq and Ya`qub, and each one of them We made a Prophet.) (19:49) That is, when he left his people, Allah gave him joy in a righteous son who was also a Prophet, to whom in turn was born, in his grandfather's lifetime, a righteous son who was also a Prophet. Allah also says: ﴾وَوَهَبْنَا لَهُ إِسْحَـقَ وَيَعْقُوبَ نَافِلَةً﴿ (And We bestowed upon him Ishaq, and Ya`qub in addition) (21:72) meaning, as an additional gift. This is like the Ayah, ﴾فَبَشَّرْنَـهَا بِإِسْحَـقَ وَمِن وَرَآءِ إِسْحَـقَ يَعْقُوبَ﴿ (But We gave her glad tidings of Ishaq, and after Ishaq, of Ya`qub.) (11:71) meaning, to this son would be born a son during their lives, who would be a delight to them. ﴾وَجَعَلْنَا فِى ذُرِّيَّتِهِ النُّبُوَّةَ وَالْكِتَـبَ﴿ (and We ordained among his offspring prophethood and the Book,) This is a tremendous blessing. Not only did Allah take him as a close friend and make him an Imam for mankind, but He also ordained prophethood and the Book among his offspring. After the time of Ibrahim there was no Prophet who was not from among his descendants. All of the Prophets of the Children of Israel were from among his descendants, from Ya`qub bin Ishaq bin Ibrahim to the last of them, `Isa bin Maryam, who stood in the midst of his people and announced the good news of the Hashimi Qurashi Arab Prophet, the last of all the Messengers, the leader of the sons of Adam in this world and the next, whom Allah chose from the heart of the Arab nation, from the descendants of Isma`il bin Ibrahim, may peace be upon them. There is no Prophet from the line of Isma`il besides him, may the best of blessings and peace be upon him. ﴾وَءَاتَيْنَاهُ أَجْرَهُ فِى الدُّنْيَا وَإِنَّهُ فِى لاٌّخِرَةِ لَمِنَ الصَّـلِحِينَ﴿ (and We granted him his reward in this world; and verily, in the Hereafter he is indeed among the righteous.) Allah granted him happiness in this world that was connected to happiness in the Hereafter, for in this world he had plentiful provision, a splendid home, a beautiful and righteous wife, and he was and still is spoken of highly, for everyone loves him and regards him as a friend. Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Qatadah and others said: \"He obeyed Allah in all ways.\" This is like the Ayah, ﴾وَإِبْرَهِيمَ الَّذِى وَفَّى ﴿ (And of Ibrahim who fulfilled all.) (53:37) He did all that he was commanded to do and obeyed his Lord to the utmost. Allah says: ﴾وَءَاتَيْنَاهُ أَجْرَهُ فِى الدُّنْيَا وَإِنَّهُ فِى لاٌّخِرَةِ لَمِنَ الصَّـلِحِينَ﴿ (and We granted him his reward in this world; and verily, in the Hereafter he is indeed among the righteous.) And He says: ﴾إِنَّ إِبْرَهِيمَ كَانَ أُمَّةً قَـنِتًا لِلَّهِ حَنِيفًا وَلَمْ يَكُ مِنَ الْمُشْرِكِينَ ﴿ (Verily, Ibrahim was an Ummah, Qanit to Allah, a Hanif, and he was not one of the idolators) until: ﴾وَإِنَّهُ فِى الاٌّخِرَةِ لَمِنَ الصَّـلِحِينَ﴿ (and in the Hereafter he shall be of the righteous) (16:120-122).

  29,30,"<h2>The preaching of Lut and what happened between Him and His People</h2> Allah tells us that His Prophet Lut, peace be upon him, denounced his people for their evil deed and their immoral actions in having intercourse with males, a deed which none of the sons of Adam had ever committed before them. As well as doing this, they also disbelieved in Allah and rejected and opposed His Messenger, they robbed wayfarers, they would lie in wait on the road, kill people and loot their possessions. ﴾وَتَأْتُونَ فِى نَادِيكُمُ الْمُنْكَرَ﴿ (And practice Al-Munkar in your meetings.) This means, `in your gatherings you do and say things that are not befitting, and you do not denounce one another for doing such things.' Some said that they used to have intercourse with one another in public; this was the view of Mujahid. Some said that they used to compete in passing gas and laughing. This was the view of `A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, and Al-Qasim. Some of them said that they used to make rams fight one another, or organize cockfights. They used to do all of these things, and they were even eviler than that. ﴾فَمَا كَانَ جَوَابَ قَوْمِهِ إِلاَّ أَن قَالُواْ ائْتِنَا بِعَذَابِ اللَّهِ إِن كُنتَ مِنَ الصَّـدِقِينَ﴿ (But his people gave no answer except that they said: \"Bring Allah's torment upon us if you are one of the truthful.\") This is indicative of their disbelief, scornful attitude and stubbornness. So Allah's Prophet asked for help against them, and said: ﴾رَبِّ انصُرْنِى عَلَى الْقَوْمِ الْمُفْسِدِينَ﴿ (My Lord! Give me victory over the people who are corrupt.) "
