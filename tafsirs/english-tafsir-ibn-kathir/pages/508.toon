  47,13,"<h2>Admonition and Fire for the Disbelievers; Paradise for Those Who have Taqwa</h2> Allah says,  أَفَلَمْ يَسِيرُواْ  (Have they not traveled) meaning, those who associate partners with Allah and deny His Messenger .  فِى الاٌّرْضِ فَيَنظُرُواْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَـقِبَةُ الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ دَمَّرَ اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِمْ  (through the land and seen what happened in the end to those before them Allah destroyed them completely,) which means that Allah punished them because of their denial and disbelief, and saved the believers from among them. That is why He says,  وَلِلْكَـفِرِينَ أَمْثَـلُهَا  (and a similar (end awaits) the disbelievers.) Then Allah says,  ذَلِكَ بِأَنَّ اللَّهَ مَوْلَى الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَأَنَّ الْكَـفِرِينَ لاَ مَوْلَى لَهُمْ  (That is because Allah is the Protector of all those who believe, whereas the disbelievers have no protector.) After the battle of Uhud, Abu Sufyan Sakhr bin Harb, the commander of the idolators at that time, inquired about the Prophet , Abu Bakr, and `Umar, may Allah be pleased with them. When he heard no response, he announced: \"Verily, those three have died!\" `Umar then responded to him: \"You lie, O enemy of Allah! Allah has indeed saved those who will displease you. Indeed, those whom you mentioned are all alive!\" Abu Sufyan then said: \"Well, today makes up for (the defeat on) the day of Badr, and the war has its ups and downs. And indeed, you are going to find mutilation (in the bodies of your dead) that I did not command, nor did I prohibit.\" Then he turned around chanting: \"Glory to Hubal (their greatest idol), Glory to Hubal.\" Allah's Messenger ﷺ said:  «أَلَا تُجِيبُوهُ؟»  (Aren't you going to respond to him) The Companions said: \"What should we say, O Messenger of Allah\" He said:  « قُولُوا: اللهُ أَعْلَى وَأَجَل»  (Say: \"Allah is Most High and Most Glorious.\") Then Abu Sufyan said: \"We have Al-`Uzza (their second idol), and you have no `Uzza. (honor).\" Allah's Messenger ﷺ said:  «أَلَا تُجِيبُوهُ؟»  (Aren't you all going to respond to him) They said: \"What should we say, O Messenger of Allah\" He said:  «قُولُوا: اللهُ مَوْلَانَا وَلَا مَوْلَى لَكُم»  (Say: \"Allah is our Protector, and you have no protector.\") Allah then says,  إِنَّ اللَّهَ يُدْخِلُ الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّـلِحَـتِ جَنَـتٍ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهَا الاٌّنْهَـرُ  (Verily, Allah will admit those who believe and do righteous good deeds into Gardens through which rivers flow.) meaning, on the Day of Resurrection.  وَالَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ يَتَمَتَّعُونَ وَيَأْكُلُونَ كَمَا تَأْكُلُ الاٌّنْعَـمُ  (Whereas those who disbelieve enjoy their life and eat as cattle eat. ) Which means that the disbelievers enjoy their worldly life and eat in it like animals, munching and gnawing (with greed). They have no concern other than that. Thus, it has been confirmed in the Sahih that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,  «الْمُؤْمِنُ يَأْكُلُ فِي مِعىً وَاحِدٍ، وَالْكَافِرُ يَأْكُلُ فِي سَبْعَةِ أَمْعَاء»  (A believer eats with one intestine, and a disbeliever eats with seven intestines.) Then Allah says,  وَالنَّارُ مَثْوًى لَّهُمْ  (but the Fire will be their abode.) meaning, on the Day of their Reckoning. Allah then says,  وَكَأَيِّن مِّن قَرْيَةٍ هِىَ أَشَدُّ قُوَّةً مِّن قَرْيَتِكَ الَّتِى أَخْرَجَتْكَ  (And how many a town mightier than your town that has driven you out) meaning, Makkah.  أَهْلَكْنَـهُمْ فَلاَ نَـصِرَ لَهُمْ  (We have destroyed, with none to help them!) gThis is a great threat and severe warning to the people of Makkah because they rejected Allah's Messenger ﷺ, who was the chief of the Messengers and the last of the Prophets. If Allah had destroyed the previous nations because of their denial of their Messengers, what then would those (people of Makkah) expect that Allah would do to them in the worldly life and the Hereafter And if the torment were to be lifted off some of them in this life by the blessing of the presence of the Messenger, the Prophet of Mercy, the torment will be stored for them in their next life, as Allah says,  يُضَاعَفُ لَهُمُ الْعَذَابُ مَا كَانُواْ يَسْتَطِيعُونَ السَّمْعَ وَمَا كَانُواْ يُبْصِرُونَ  (Their torment will be doubled! They could not bear to hear (the preaching), and they used not to see (the truth).) (11:20) Concerning Allah's saying,  مِّن قَرْيَتِكَ الَّتِى أَخْرَجَتْكَ  (than Your town that has driven you out) This means, `its people who have driven you (Muhammad ﷺ ) out from amongst them (the people of Makkah).' Ibn Abi Hatim recorded from Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, that when Allah's Messenger ﷺ left Makkah (at the time of Hijrah -- migration), and he reached the cave and hid inside it, he looked back toward Makkah and said,  «أَنْتِ أَحَبُّ بِلَادِ اللهِ إِلَى اللهِ، وَأَنْتِ أَحَبُّ بِلَادِ اللهِ إِلَيَّ، وَلَوْلَا أَنَّ الْمُشْرِكِينَ أَخْرَجُونِي لَمْ أَخْرُجْ مِنْك»  (You are the most beloved to Allah among Allah's lands, and you are also the most beloved to me among Allah's lands. Were it not that the idolators have driven me out from you, I would never have left you.) Ibn `Abbas then said, \"The worst of enemies is he who transgresses against Allah in His own sacred place, who kills a person who is not trying to kill him, or who kills because of Jahiliyyah vengeance. Allah then revealed to His Prophet ,  وَكَأَيِّن مِّن قَرْيَةٍ هِىَ أَشَدُّ قُوَّةً مِّن قَرْيَتِكَ الَّتِى أَخْرَجَتْكَ أَهْلَكْنَـهُمْ فَلاَ نَـصِرَ لَهُمْ  (And how many a town mightier than your town that has driven you out have We destroyed, with none to help them!)\" "

  47,15,"<h2>The Worshipper of the Truth and the Worshipper of Lust are not Equal</h2> Allah says:  أَفَمَن كَانَ عَلَى بَيِّنَةٍ مِّن رَّبِّهِ  (Can then he, who stands on clear evidence from his Lord...) This means a person who is upon clear vision and certainty concerning Allah's commands and His religion, because of the guidance and knowledge that Allah has revealed in His Book, and because of the pure nature upon which Allah has created him.  كَمَن زُيِّنَ لَهُ سُوءُ عَمَلِهِ وَاتَّبَعُواْ أَهْوَاءَهُمْ  ((Can he) be likened to those for whom their evil deeds are beautified for them, while they follow their own lusts) which means that they cannot be equal. This is similar to Allah's saying,  أَفَمَن يَعْلَمُ أَنَّمَآ أُنزِلَ إِلَيْكَ مِن رَبِّكَ الْحَقُّ كَمَنْ هُوَ أَعْمَى  (Can he who knows that what has been revealed unto you from your Lord is the truth be like him who is blind) (13:19) And,  لاَ يَسْتَوِى أَصْحَـبُ النَّارِ وَأَصْحَـبُ الْجَنَّةِ أَصْحَـبُ الْجَنَّةِ هُمُ الْفَآئِزُونَ  (Not equal are the people of the Fire and the people of Paradise. The People of Paradise will be the successful ones.) (59:20) <h2>Description of Paradise and Its Rivers</h2> Allah then says:  مَّثَلُ الْجَنَّةِ الَّتِى وُعِدَ الْمُتَّقُونَ  (The description of Paradise which is promised for those who have Taqwa...) `Ikrimah said,  مَّثَلُ الْجَنَّةِ  (The description of Paradise) \"This means its description.\"  فِيهَآ أَنْهَارٌ مِّن مَّآءٍ غَيْرِ ءَاسِنٍ  (In it are rivers of water that are not Asin,) Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Al-Hasan, and Qatadah all said, \"It does not change.\" Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak, and `Ata' Al-Khurasani all said, \"It is not foul-smelling.\" The Arabs say Asin if its (water) scent changes.  وَأَنْهَارٌ مِّن لَّبَنٍ لَّمْ يَتَغَيَّرْ طَعْمُهُ  (rivers of milk, the taste of which never changes,) which means that the milk is of utmost whiteness, sweetness, and richness. It has been mentioned in a Hadith attributed to the Prophet \"Their milk did not come out of the udders of cattle.\"  وَأَنْهَـرٌ مِّنْ خَمْرٍ لَّذَّةٍ لِّلشَّـرِبِينَ  (rivers of wine delightful to those who drink it, ) hich means that the wine does not have a bad taste or foul smell like that of the worldly life. Rather, it is good in its appearance, taste, smell, and effect, as Allah says,  لاَ فِيهَا غَوْلٌ وَلاَ هُمْ عَنْهَا يُنزَفُونَ  (it (the wine) has no bad effects, nor does it cause intoxication.) (37:47) and,  لاَّ يُصَدَّعُونَ عَنْهَا وَلاَ يُنزِفُونَ  (From which (the wine) they will have no headache, nor will they be intoxicated.) (56:19)  بَيْضَآءَ لَذَّةٍ لِّلشَّـرِبِينَ  (white, delicious to the drinkers.)(37:46) It has been mentioned in a Hadith attributed to the Prophet , \"Their wine was not pressed under men's feet.\"  وَأَنْهَـرٌ مِّنْ عَسَلٍ مُّصَفًّى  (and rivers of refined honey;) which means that the honey is of utmost purity and pleasant color, taste, and smell. It has been mentioned in a Hadith attributed to the Prophet , \"Their honey did not come out of the bellies of bees.\" Imam Ahmad recorded from Hakim bin Mu`awiyah who narrated from his father that Allah's Messenger ﷺ said,  «فِي الْجَنَّةِ بَحْرُ اللَّبَنِ وَبَحْرُ الْمَاءِ وَبَحْرُ الْعَسَلِ وَبَحْرُ الْخَمْرِ، ثُمَّ تُشَقَّقُ الْأَنْهَارُ مِنْهَا بَعْد»  (Verily, there is in Paradise a lake of milk, a lake of water, a lake of honey, and a lake of wine. The rivers then gush out of them. At-Tirmidhi reported this narration in his section of the Description of Paradise, and he said, \"Hasan Sahih. In the Sahih, it is recorded that Allah's Messenger ﷺ said,  «إِذَا سَأَلْتُمُ اللهَ تَعَالى فَاسْأَلُوهُ الْفِرْدَوْسَ فَإِنَّهُ أَوْسَطُ الْجَنَّةِ، وَأَعْلَى الْجَنَّةِ، وَمِنْهُ تُفَجَّرُ أَنْهَارُ الْجَنَّةِ، وَفَوْقَهُ عَرْشُ الرَّحْمن»  (When you ask Allah, ask Him for Al-Firdaws, because it is the central and highest part of the Paradise, and from it gush the rivers of the Paradise and above it is the Throne of the Most Merciful.)Allah says,  وَلَهُمْ فِيهَا مِن كُلِّ الثَّمَرَتِ  (...and therein for them are all kinds of fruits, ...) This similar to His saying,  يَدْعُونَ فِيهَا بِكلِّ فَـكِهَةٍ ءَامِنِينَ  (They will call in it for every kind of fruit in peace and security.) (44:55) And His saying,  فِيهِمَا مِن كُلِّ فَـكِهَةٍ زَوْجَانِ  (In them will be every kind of fruits in pairs.) (55:52) Allah says  وَمَغْفِرَةٌ مِّن رَّبِّهِمْ  (. ..and forgiveness from their Lord.) meaning, in addition to all of the above. Allah says,  كَمَنْ هُوَ خَـلِدٌ فِى النَّارِ  (Can this be likened to those who abide eternally in the Fire) meaning, `can those that We have described their position in the Paradise be like those who will abide eternally in the Fire' They are not equal, and nor are those who will be in the high ranks (in the Paradise) and those who will be in the lowest depths (Hell).  وَسُقُواْ مَآءً حَمِيماً  (and are given to drink boiling water) meaning, extremely hot; so hot that it is unbearable.  فَقَطَّعَ أَمْعَآءَهُمْ  (that severs their intestines) meaning, that will cut their insides -- both bowels and intestines. We seek refuge in Allah from that.  وَمِنْهُمْ مَّن يَسْتَمِعُ إِلَيْكَ حَتَّى إِذَا خَرَجُواْ مِنْ عِندِكَ قَالُواْ لِلَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ الْعِلْمَ مَاذَا قَالَ ءَانِفاً أُوْلَـئِكَ الَّذِينَ طَبَعَ اللَّهُ عَلَى قُلُوبِهِمْ وَاتَّبَعُواْ أَهْوَآءَهُمْ - وَالَّذِينَ اهْتَدَوْاْ زَادَهُمْ هُدًى وَءَاتَـهُمْ تَقُوَاهُمْ - فَهَلْ يَنظُرُونَ إِلاَّ السَّاعَةَ أَن تَأْتِيَهُمْ بَغْتَةً فَقَدْ جَآءَ أَشْرَاطُهَا فَأَنَّى لَهُمْ إِذَا جَآءَتْهُمْ ذِكْرَاهُمْ "

  47,19,"<h2>The Description of the Situation of the Hypocrites and the Command to maintain Tawhid and seek Forgiveness</h2> Allah describes the hypocrites' stupidity and limited understanding. They used to sit before Allah's Messenger ﷺ and listen to his words without understanding anything. Then when they left from his presence,  قَالُواْ لِلَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ الْعِلْمَ  (they say to those who have received knowledge) from the Companions  مَاذَا قَالَ ءَانِفاً  (\"What is it that he has said just now\") meaning, at this moment. They did not understand what he said, nor did they care about it. Allah says,  أُوْلَـئِكَ الَّذِينَ طَبَعَ اللَّهُ عَلَى قُلُوبِهِمْ وَاتَّبَعُواْ أَهْوَآءَهُمْ  (Such are the men whose hearts Allah has sealed because they followed their lusts.) which means that they had neither sound understanding nor correct intentions. Allah then says,  وَالَّذِينَ اهْتَدَوْاْ زَادَهُمْ هُدًى  (And as for those who accept guidance, He increases them in guidance) which means that those who seek guidance, Allah facilitates it for them; He guides them to it, makes them firm on it, and gives them more of it.  وَءَاتَـهُمْ تَقُوَاهُمْ  (and bestows on them their Taqwa. ) meaning, He inspires them to their righteous guidance. Allah then says,  فَهَلْ يَنظُرُونَ إِلاَّ السَّاعَةَ أَن تَأْتِيَهُمْ بَغْتَةً  (Do they then await except that the Hour should come upon them suddenly) meaning, while they are unaware of it.  فَقَدْ جَآءَ أَشْرَاطُهَا  (But already there have come (some of) its portents;) meaning, the signs of its approach. This is similar to Allah's saying,  هَـذَا نَذِيرٌ مِّنَ النُّذُرِ الاٍّوْلَى - أَزِفَتِ الاٌّزِفَةُ  (This is a warner of the warners of old. The approaching Day has drawn near.) (53:56-57) And His saying,  اقْتَرَبَتِ السَّاعَةُ وَانشَقَّ الْقَمَرُ  (The Hour has drawn near, and the moon has split.) (54:1) And His saying,  أَتَى أَمْرُ اللَّهِ فَلاَ تَسْتَعْجِلُوهُ  (The command of Allah is coming, so do not be impatient for it.) (16:1) And His saying,  اقْتَرَبَ لِلنَّاسِ حِسَـبُهُمْ وَهُمْ فِى غَفْلَةٍ مُّعْرِضُونَ  (The people's Day of Reckoning has approached while they turn away in heedlessness.) (21:1) Thus, the Messenger's ﷺ advent is one of the signs of the Hour, because he is the Finality of the Messengers. With him, Allah has completed the religion and established the evidence against all people in a way that was never done by a previous Prophet. Allah's Messenger ﷺ has most clearly informed about the signs and indications of the Hour, as we have discussed elsewhere. Al-Bukhari recorded from Sahl bin Sa`d, may Allah be pleased with him, that he saw Allah's Messenger ﷺ bring his index and middle fingers together while he said,  «بُعِثْتُ أَنَا وَالسَّاعَةَ كَهَاتَيْن»  (I have been sent before the Hour as these two (fingers).) Allah continues,  فَأَنَّى لَهُمْ إِذَا جَآءَتْهُمْ ذِكْرَاهُمْ  (and when it (actually) is on them, how can they benefit then by their reminder) meaning, how would remembering benefit the disbelievers when the Hour comes upon them This is similar to Allah's saying,  يَوْمَئِذٍ يَتَذَكَّرُ الإِنسَـنُ وَأَنَّى لَهُ الذِّكْرَى  (On that Day will the human being remember, but what would that remembrance avail him then) (89:23) And His saying,  وَقَالُواْ ءَامَنَّا بِهِ وَأَنَّى لَهُمُ التَّنَاوُشُ مِن مَّكَانِ بَعِيدٍ  (They will say (in the Hereafter): \"Now we believe in it!\" But how could they claim belief from such a far place) (34:52) Allah then says,  فَاعْلَمْ أَنَّهُ لاَ إِلَـهَ إِلأاللَّهِ  (So know that La ilaha illallah) This is a declaration that there is no true God except Allah. It is not something that is easy for him to command the people to have knowledge of. That is why Allah connected it with,  وَاسْتَغْفِرْ لِذَنبِكَ وَلِلْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَالْمُؤْمِنَـتِ  (and ask forgiveness for your sin and for the believing men and women.) In the Sahih, it is recorded that Allah's Messenger ﷺ used to say,  «اللْهُمَّ اغْفِرْ لِي خَطِيئَتِي وَجَهْلِي وَإِسْرَافِي فِي أَمْرِي وَمَا أَنْتَ أَعْلَمُ بِهِ مِنِّي، اللْهُمَّ اغْفِرْ لِي هَزْلِي وَجِدِّي، وَخَطَئِي وَعَمْدِي، وَكُلُّ ذلِكَ عِنْدِي»  (O Allah, forgive my sin, my ignorance, my immoderation in my affairs, and all that You know better about my (faults) than myself. O Allah, forgive for me my joking, my seriousness, my unintended error, and my deliberate (mistakes) -- and I have done of all that.) It is also reported in the Sahih that he used to say at the end of the prayer,  «اللْهُمَّ اغْفِرْ لِي مَا قَدَّمْتُ وَمَا أَخَّرْتُ، وَمَا أَسْرَرْتُ وَمَا أَعْلَنْتُ، وَمَا أَسْرَفْتُ، وَمَا أَنْتَ أَعْلَمُ بِهِ مِنِّي، أَنْتَ إِلهِي لَا إِلهَ إِلَّا أَنْت»  (O Allah, forgive for me what I have previously done, what I may commit in future, what I have committed secretly, what I have committed openly, what I have done excessively, and all sins that You know better than me. You are my God. There is no (true) God except You.) It is also recorded in the Sahih that he used to say,  «يَاأَيُّهَا النَّاسُ تُوبُوا إِلَى رَبِّكُمْ، فَإِنِّي أَسْتَغْفِرُ اللهَ وَأَتُوبُ إِلَيْهِ فِي الْيَوْمِ أَكْثَرَ مِنْ سَبْعِينَ مَرَّة»  (O people! Repent to your Lord! Verily, I ask Allah for forgiveness and repent to Him more than seventy times every day.) Allah then says,  وَاللَّهُ يَعْلَمُ مُتَقَلَّبَكُمْ وَمَثْوَاكُمْ  (And Allah knows well your moving about, and your place of rest.) means, He knows how you behave during the day, and where you settle at night. This is similar to His saying,  وَهُوَ الَّذِى يَتَوَفَّـكُم بِالَّيْلِ وَيَعْلَمُ مَا جَرَحْتُم بِالنَّهَارِ  (It is He Who takes your souls by night and knows all that you do by day.)(6:60) And He says,  وَمَا مِن دَآبَّةٍ فِي الاٌّرْضِ إِلاَّ عَلَى اللَّهِ رِزْقُهَا وَيَعْلَمُ مُسْتَقَرَّهَا وَمُسْتَوْدَعَهَا كُلٌّ فِى كِتَابٍ مُّبِينٍ  (And there is no moving creature on earth but its provision is up to Allah, and He knows its dwelling place and its deposit (before birth and after death) -- all is in a clear register.) (11:6) "
