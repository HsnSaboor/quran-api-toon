tafsir[8]{c,v,t}:
  10,107,"<h2>The Command to worship Allah Alone and rely upon Him</h2> Allah, the Exalted, says to His Messenger, Muhammad , `Say: O mankind! If you are in doubt about the correctness of that which I have been sent with the Hanif (monotheism) religion - the religion which Allah has revealed to me -- then know that I do not worship those whom you worship besides Allah. Rather, I worship Allah alone, ascribing no partners to Him. He is the One Who causes you to die just as He gives you life. Then, unto Him is your final return. If the gods that you call upon are real, I still refuse to worship them. So call upon them and ask them to harm me, and you will see that they can bring no harm or benefit. The only One Who holds the power of harm and benefit in His Hand is Allah alone, Who has no partners.'  ﴾وَأُمِرْتُ أَنْ أَكُونَ مِنَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ﴿ (And I was commanded to be one of the believers.) 10:104 Concerning Allah's statement,  ﴾وَأَنْ أَقِمْ وَجْهَكَ لِلدِّينِ حَنِيفًا﴿ (And that you direct your face towards the Hanif religion) This means to make one's intention in worship solely for Allah alone, being a Hanif. Hanif means one who turns away from associating partners with Allah. For this reason Allah says,  ﴾وَلاَ تَكُونَنَّ مِنَ الْمُشْرِكَينَ﴿ (and not be one of the idolators. ) This statement is directly connected with the previous statement,  ﴾وَأُمِرْتُ أَنْ أَكُونَ مِنَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ﴿ (And I was commanded to be one of the believers.) Concerning His statement,  ﴾وَإِن يَمْسَسْكَ اللَّهُ بِضُرٍّ﴿ (And if Allah touches you with harm,) This verse contains the explanation that good, evil, benefit and harm only come from Allah alone and no one shares with His power over these things. Therefore, He is the One Who deserves to be worshipped alone, without ascription of partners. Concerning His statement,  ﴾وَهُوَ الْغَفُورُ الرَّحِيمُ﴿ (And He is the Pardoning, the Merciful.) This means that He is forgiving and merciful towards those who turn to Him in repentance, regardless of what sin the person has committed. Even if the person associated a partner with Allah, verily Allah would forgive him if he repented from it.  "

  10,109,"﴾وَمَآ أَنَاْ عَلَيْكُمْ بِوَكِيلٍ﴿ (And I am not set over you as a guardian) This means, `I am not a guardian over you in order for you to become believers. I am only a warner to you and guidance belongs to Allah, the Exalted.' Concerning Allah's statement,  ﴾وَاتَّبِعْ مَا يُوحَى إِلَيْكَ وَاصْبِرْ﴿ (And follow what has been revealed to you, and be patient) This means, `Adhere to that which Allah has revealed to you, and inspired you with, and be patient with the opposition that you meet from the people.'  ﴾حَتَّى يَحْكُمَ اللَّهُ﴿ (until Allah gives judgment) This means, `Until Allah judges between you and them.'  ﴾وَهُوَ خَيْرُ الْحَـكِمِينَ﴿ (And He is the best of judges. ) This means that He is the best of those who pass judgment, due to His Justice and His wisdom.

  11,4,"<h2>Which was revealed in Makkah</h2><h2>Surah Hud made the Prophet's Hair turn Gray</h2> Abu `Isa At-Tirmidhi recorded from Ibn `Abbas that Abu Bakr said, \"O Messenger of Allah, verily your hair has turned gray.\" The Prophet replied,  «شَيَّبَتْنِي هُودٌ وَالْوَاقِعَةُ وَالْمُرْسَلَاتُ وَعَمَّ يَتَسَاءَلُونَ وَإِذَا الشَّمْسُ كُوِّرَت»  (Surahs Hud, Al-Waqi`ah, Al-Mursalat, `Amma Yatasa'lun An-Naba' and Idhash-Shamsu Kuwwirat At-Takwir have turned my hair gray.) In another narration he said,  «هُودٌ وَأَخَوَاتُهَا»  (Surah Hud and its sisters...)  بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ  In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. <h2>The Qur'an and its Call to (worship) Allah Alone</h2> A discussion concerning the letters of the alphabet (which appear at the beginning of some chapters of the Qur'an) has already preceded at the beginning of Surat Al-Baqarah. That discussion is sufficient without any need for repetition here. Concerning Allah's statement,  أُحْكِمَتْ ءايَـتُهُ ثُمَّ فُصِّلَتْ  (The Ayat whereof are perfect and then explained in detail) This means perfect in its wording, detailed in its meaning. Thus, it is complete in its form and its meaning. This interpretation was reported from Mujahid and Qatadah, and Ibn Jarir At-Tabari preferred it. Concerning the meaning of Allah's statement,  مِن لَّدُنْ حَكِيمٍ خَبِيرٍ  (from One (Allah), Who is All-Wise, Well-Acquainted.) This means that it (the Qur'an) is from Allah, Who is Most Wise in His statements and His Laws, and Most Aware of the final outcome of matters.  أَلاَّ تَعْبُدُواْ إِلاَّ اللَّهَ  ((Saying) worship none but Allah.) This means that this Qur'an descended, perfect and detailed, with the purpose of Allah's worship alone, without any partners. This is similar to the statement of Allah, the Exalted,  وَمَآ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ مِن رَّسُولٍ إِلاَّ نُوحِى إِلَيْهِ أَنَّهُ لا إِلَـهَ إِلاَّ أَنَاْ فَاعْبُدُونِ  (And We did not send any Messenger before you but We revealed to him (saying): There is no God but I, so worship Me.) 21:25 It is similar to Allah's statement,  وَلَقَدْ بَعَثْنَا فِى كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَّسُولاً أَنِ اعْبُدُواْ اللَّهَ وَاجْتَنِبُواْ الْطَّـغُوتَ  (And verily, We have sent among every Ummah a Messenger (proclaiming): `Worship Allah (Alone), and avoid Taghut (calling false deities.)')16:36 In reference to Allah's statement,  إِنَّنِى لَكُمْ مِّنْهُ نَذِيرٌ وَبَشِيرٌ  (Verily, I am unto you from Him a warner and a bringer of glad tidings.) This means, \"Verily, I am unto you a warner of the punishment if you oppose Him (Allah), and a bringer of the good news of reward if you obey Him.\" This meaning has been recorded in the authentic Hadith which states that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ ascended mount As-Safa and called out to his near relatives of the Quraysh tribe. When they gathered around him, he said,  «يَا مَعْشَرَ قُرَيْشٍ أَرَأَيْتُمْ لَوْ أَخْبَرْتُكُمْ أَنَّ خَيْلًا تُصَبِّحُكُمْ أَلَسْتُمْ مُصَدِّقِيَّ؟»  (O people of Quraysh, if I informed you that a cavalry was going to attack you in the morning, would you not believe me) They replied, \"We have not found you to be a liar.\" He said,  «فَإِنِّي نَذِيرٌ لَكُمْ بَيْنَ يَدَي عَذَابٍ شَدِيد»  (Verily I am a warner unto you before a severe punishment.) Concerning His statement,  وَأَنِ اسْتَغْفِرُواْ رَبَّكُمْ ثُمَّ تُوبُواْ إِلَيْهِ يُمَتِّعْكُمْ مَّتَاعًا حَسَنًا إِلَى أَجَلٍ مُّسَمًّى وَيُؤْتِ كُلَّ ذِي فَضْلٍ فَضْلَهُ  (And (commanding you): `Seek the forgiveness of your Lord, and turn to Him in repentance, that He may grant you good enjoyment, for a term appointed, and bestow His abounding grace to every owner of grace.) This means, \"I am commanding you to seek forgiveness from previous sins and to turn to Allah from future sins, and thereafter you abide by that.\"  يُمَتِّعْكُمْ مَّتَاعًا حَسَنًا  (that He may grant you good enjoyment,) This is in reference to this worldly life.  إِلَى أَجَلٍ مُّسَمًّى وَيُؤْتِ كُلَّ ذِي فَضْلٍ فَضْلَهُ  (for a term appointed, and bestow His abounding grace to every owner of grace.) This refers to the Hereafter, according to Qatadah. \"This is like the statement of Allah,  مَنْ عَمِلَ صَـلِحاً مِّن ذَكَرٍ أَوْ أُنْثَى وَهُوَ مُؤْمِنٌ فَلَنُحْيِيَنَّهُ حَيَوةً طَيِّبَةً  (Whoever works righteousness -- whether male or female -- while a true believer, verily to him We will give a good life.)16:97 Concerning Allah's statement,  وَإِن تَوَلَّوْاْ فَإِنِّي أَخَافُ عَلَيْكُمْ عَذَابَ يَوْمٍ كَبِيرٍ  (But if you turn away, then I fear for you the torment of a Great Day.) This is a severe threat for whoever turns away from the commandments of Allah, the Exalted, and rejects His Messengers. Verily, the punishment will afflict such a person on the Day of Resurrection and there will be no escape from it.  إِلَى الله مَرْجِعُكُمْ  (To Allah is your return,) This is means your return on the Day of Judgement.  وَهُوَ عَلَى كُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدِيرٌ  (and He is able to do all things.) This means that He is capable of doing whatever He wishes, whether it be goodness towards His Awliya' (friends and allies), or vengeance upon His enemies. This also includes His ability to repeat the creation of His creatures on the Day of Resurrection. This section encourages fear, just as the previous section encourages hope. "
  11,5,"<h2>Allah is Aware of All Things</h2> Ibn `Abbas said, \"They used to dislike facing the sky with their private parts, particularly during sexual relations. Therefore, Allah revealed this verse.\" Al-Bukhari recorded by way of Ibn Jurayj, who reported from Muhammad bin `Abbad bin Ja`far who said, \"Ibn `Abbas recited, (أَلَا إِنَّهُمْ تَثْنَونِي صُدُورُهُمْ) \"Behold their breasts did fold up.\" So I said: `O Abu Al-`Abbas! What does -their breasts did fold up- mean' He said, `The man used to have sex with his woman, but he would be shy, or he used to have answering the call of nature (in an open space) but, he would be shy. Therefore, this verse,  ﴾أَلا إِنَّهُمْ يَثْنُونَ صُدُورَهُمْ﴿ (No doubt! They did fold up their breasts,) was revealed.\"' In another wording of this narration, Ibn `Abbas said, \"There were people who used to be shy to remove their clothes while answering the call of nature in an open space and thus be naked exposed to the sky. They were also ashamed of having sexual relations with their women due to fear of being exposed towards the sky. Thus, this was revealed concerning them.\" Al-Bukhari reported that Ibn `Abbas said that  ﴾يَسْتَغْشُونَ﴿ (they cover themselves) means that they cover their heads.  "
