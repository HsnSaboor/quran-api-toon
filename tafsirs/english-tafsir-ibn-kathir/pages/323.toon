  21,15,"<h2>The Virtue of the Qur'an Here</h2> Allah points out the noble status of the Qur'an and urges them to recognize its worth: ﴾لَقَدْ أَنزَلْنَآ إِلَيْكُمْ كِتَـباً فِيهِ ذِكْرُكُمْ﴿ (Indeed, We have sent down for you a Book in which there is Dhikrukum). Ibn `Abbas said: \"Honor for you.\" ﴾أَفَلاَ تَعْقِلُونَ﴿ (Will you not then understand) means, will you not understand this blessing, and accept it This is like the Ayah: ﴾وَإِنَّهُ لَذِكْرٌ لَّكَ وَلِقَوْمِكَ وَسَوْفَ تُسْـَلُونَ ﴿ (And verily, this is indeed a Reminder for you and your people, and you will be questioned.) 43:44 <h2>How the Evildoers were destroyed</h2>﴾وَكَمْ قَصَمْنَا مِن قَرْيَةٍ كَانَتْ ظَـلِمَةً﴿ (How many a town given to wrongdoing, have We destroyed,) meaning, they were very many. This is like the Ayah: ﴾وَكَمْ أَهْلَكْنَا مِنَ الْقُرُونِ مِن بَعْدِ نُوحٍ﴿ (And how many generations have We destroyed after Nuh!) 17:17 ﴾فَكَأَيِّن مِّن قَرْيَةٍ أَهْلَكْنَـهَا وَهِىَ ظَالِمَةٌ فَهِىَ خَاوِيَةٌ عَلَى عُرُوشِهَا﴿ (And many a township did We destroy while they were given to wrongdoing, so that it lie in ruins) 22:45. ﴾وَأَنشَأْنَا بَعْدَهَا قَوْماً ءَاخَرِينَ﴿ (and raised up after them another people!) means, another nation which came after them. ﴾فَلَمَّآ أَحَسُّواْ بَأْسَنَآ﴿ (Then, when they sensed Our torment,) when they realized that the torment would undoubtedly come upon them, just as their Prophet had warned them, ﴾إِذَا هُمْ مِّنْهَا يَرْكُضُونَ﴿ (behold, they (tried to) flee from it.) they tried to run away. ﴾لاَ تَرْكُضُواْ وَارْجِعُواْ إِلَى مَآ أُتْرِفْتُمْ فِيهِ وَمَسَـكِنِكُمْ﴿ (Flee not, but return to that wherein you lived a luxurious life, and to your homes,) This is a way of ridiculing them. It will be said to them by way of ridicule: \"Do not run away from the coming torment; go back to the delights and luxuries and fine homes in which you were living.\" Qatadah said, \"Mocking them.\" ﴾لَعَلَّكُمْ تُسْأَلُونَ﴿ (in order that you may be questioned) about whether you gave thanks for what you had. ﴾قَالُواْ يوَيْلَنَآ إِنَّا كُنَّا ظَـلِمِينَ ﴿ (They cried: \"Woe to us! Certainly we have been wrong- doers.\") They will confess their sins when it will be of no benefit to them. ﴾فَمَا زَالَت تِلْكَ دَعْوَاهُمْ حَتَّى جَعَلْنَـهُمْ حَصِيداً خَـمِدِينَ ﴿ (And that cry of theirs ceased not, till We made them as a field that is reaped, extinct.) meaning, \"they will keep on saying that, admitting their wrong- doing, until We harvest them as it were, and their movements and voices come to a stop.\" "

  21,20,"<h2>Creation was made with Justice and Wisdom</h2> Allah tells us that He created the heavens and the earth in truth, i.e. with justice. ﴾لِيَجْزِىَ الَّذِينَ أَسَاءُواْ بِمَا عَمِلُواْ وَيِجْزِى الَّذِينَ أَحْسَنُواْ بِالْحُسْنَى﴿ (that He may requite those who do evil with that which they have done, and reward those who do good, with what is best.) 53:31. He did not create all that in vain or for (mere) play: ﴾وَمَا خَلَقْنَا السَّمَآءَ وَالاٌّرْضَ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَا بَـطِلاً ذَلِكَ ظَنُّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ فَوَيْلٌ لِّلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ مِنَ النَّارِ ﴿ (And We created not the heaven and the earth and all that is between them without purpose! That is the consideration of those who disbelieve! Then woe to those who disbelieve from the Fire!) 38:27 ﴾لَوْ أَرَدْنَآ أَن نَّتَّخِذَ لَهْواً لاَّتَّخَذْنَـهُ مِن لَّدُنَّآ إِن كُنَّا فَـعِلِينَ ﴿ (Had We intended to take a pastime, We could surely have taken it from Us, if We were going to do (that).) Ibn Abi Najih said, narrating from Mujahid: ﴾لَوْ أَرَدْنَآ أَن نَّتَّخِذَ لَهْواً لاَّتَّخَذْنَـهُ مِن لَّدُنَّآ﴿ (Had We intended to take a pastime, We could surely have taken it from Us,) \"Meaning, `From Ourself,' He is saying, `We would not have created Paradise or Hell or death or the resurrection or the Reckoning.\"' ﴾إِن كُنَّا فَـعِلِينَ﴿ (if We were going to do (that). ) Qatadah, As-Suddi, Ibrahim An-Nakha`i and Mughirah bin Miqsam said: \"This means, `We will not do that.\"' Mujahid said, every time the word ﴾أَنْ﴿ (if) is used in the Qur'an, it is a negation. ﴾بَلْ نَقْذِفُ بِالْحَقِّ عَلَى الْبَـطِلِ﴿ (Nay, We fling the truth against the falsehood,) means, `We explain the truth and thus defeat falsehood.' Allah says: ﴾فَيَدْمَغُهُ فَإِذَا هُوَ زَاهِقٌ﴿ (so it destroys it, and behold, it disappears.) it is fading and vanishing. ﴾وَلَكُمُ الْوَيْلُ﴿ (And woe to you) O you who say that Allah has offspring. ﴾مِمَّا تَصِفُونَ﴿ (for that which you ascribe.) that which you say and fabricate. Then Allah informs of the servitude of the angels, and how they persevere in worship night and day: <h2>Everything belongs to Allah and serves Him</h2>﴾وَلَهُ مَن فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ وَمَنْ عِنْدَهُ﴿ (To Him belongs whosoever is in the heavens and on earth. And those who are near Him) i.e., the angels, ﴾لاَ يَسْتَكْبِرُونَ عَنْ عِبَادَتِهِ﴿ (are not too proud to worship Him,) they do not feel proud and do not refuse to worship Him. This is like the Ayah: ﴾لَّن يَسْتَنكِفَ الْمَسِيحُ أَن يَكُونَ عَبْداً للَّهِ وَلاَ الْمَلَـئِكَةُ الْمُقَرَّبُونَ وَمَن يَسْتَنْكِفْ عَنْ عِبَادَتِهِ وَيَسْتَكْبِرْ فَسَيَحْشُرُهُمْ إِلَيهِ جَمِيعاً ﴿ (Al-Masih will never be proud to reject being a servant of Allah, nor the angels who are the near. And whosoever rejects His worship and is proud, then He will gather them all together unto Himself.) 4:172 ﴾وَلاَ يَسْتَحْسِرُونَ﴿ (nor are they weary.) means, they do not get tired or feel bored. ﴾يُسَبِّحُونَ الْلَّيْلَ وَالنَّهَارَ لاَ يَفْتُرُونَ ﴿ (They glorify His praises night and day, they never slacken.) They persist in their worship night and day, obeying Allah to the utmost, and they are able to do this, as Allah says: ﴾لاَّ يَعْصُونَ اللَّهَ مَآ أَمَرَهُمْ وَيَفْعَلُونَ مَا يُؤْمَرُونَ﴿ (who do not disobey Allah in what He commands them, but do what they are commanded) 66:6 "

  21,23,"<h2>Refutation of false gods</h2> Allah denounces those who take other gods instead of Him: ﴾أَمِ اتَّخَذُواْ آلِهَةً مِّنَ الاٌّرْضِ هُمْ يُنشِرُونَ ﴿ (Or have they taken gods from the earth who raise the dead) meaning, can they bring the dead back to life and bring them forth from the earth They cannot do any of that, so how can they make them rivals to Allah and worship them alongside Him Then Allah tells us that if there were another god besides Him, the heavens and the earth would be ruined: ﴾لَوْ كَانَ فِيهِمَآ آلِهَةٌ﴿ (Had there been therein gods) means, in the heavens and the earth, ﴾لَفَسَدَتَا﴿ (then verily, both would have been ruined.) This is like the Ayah: ﴾مَا اتَّخَذَ اللَّهُ مِن وَلَدٍ وَمَا كَانَ مَعَهُ مِنْ إِلَـهٍ إِذاً لَّذَهَبَ كُلُّ إِلَـهٍ بِمَا خَلَقَ وَلَعَلاَ بَعْضُهُمْ عَلَى بَعْضٍ سُبْحَـنَ اللَّهِ عَمَّا يَصِفُونَ ﴿ (No son did Allah beget, nor is there any god along with Him. Then each god would have taken away what he had created, and some would have tried to overcome others! Glorified be Allah above all that they attribute to Him!) 23:91. And Allah says here: ﴾فَسُبْحَـنَ اللَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَرْشِ عَمَّا يَصِفُونَ﴿ (Glorified be Allah, the Lord of the Throne, above all that they associate with Him!) meaning, glorified be He above what they say about Him having offspring or partners; glorified and exalted and sanctified be He far above all the lies that they fabricate. ﴾لاَ يُسْأَلُ عَمَّا يَفْعَلُ وَهُمْ يُسْـَلُونَ ﴿ (He cannot be questioned about what He does, while they will be questioned.) He is the Ruler Whose rule cannot be overturned and none can object to it, because of His might, majesty, pride, knowledge, wisdom, justice and subtlety. ﴾وَهُمْ يُسْـَلُونَ﴿ (while they will be questioned.) means, He is the One Who will ask His creation about what they did. This is like the Ayah: ﴾فَوَرَبِّكَ لَنَسْـَلَنَّهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ - عَمَّا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ ﴿ (So, by your Lord, We shall certainly call all of them to account. For all that they used to do.) 15:92-93 ﴾وَهُوَ يُجْيِرُ وَلاَ يُجَارُ عَلَيْهِ﴿ (And He protects (all), while against Whom there is no protector) 23:88 "
