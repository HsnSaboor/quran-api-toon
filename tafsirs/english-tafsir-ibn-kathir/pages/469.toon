  40,17,"<h2>Allah sends the Revelation to warn His Servants of the Day of Mutual Meeting</h2> Allah tells us of His might and pride, and that His Mighty Throne is raised above all of His creation like a roof. This is like the Ayah:  مِّنَ اللَّهِ ذِي الْمَعَارِجِ - تَعْرُجُ الْمَلَـئِكَةُ وَالرُّوحُ إِلَيْهِ فِى يَوْمٍ كَانَ مِقْدَارُهُ خَمْسِينَ أَلْفَ سَنَةٍ  (From Allah, the Lord of the ways of ascent. The angels and the Ruh (Jibril) ascend to Him in a Day the measure whereof is fifty thousand years.) (70:3-4). If Allah wills, we will discuss below which is the most correct view the distance between the Throne and the seventh earth according to a group of earlier and later scholars. More than one scholar said that the Throne is made of red rubies. The width between two corners of it is the distance of a fifty thousand year long journey and its height above the seventh earth is the distance of a fifty thousand years long journey.  يُلْقِى الرُّوحَ مِنْ أَمْرِهِ عَلَى مَن يَشَآءُ مِنْ عِبَادِهِ  (He sends the revelation of His command to any of His servants He wills,) This is like the Ayat:  يُنَزِّلُ الْمَلَـئِكَةَ بِالْرُّوحِ مِنْ أَمْرِهِ عَلَى مَن يَشَآءُ مِنْ عِبَادِهِ أَنْ أَنْذِرُواْ أَنَّهُ لاَ إِلَـهَ إِلاَ أَنَاْ فَاتَّقُونِ  (He sends down the angels with the Ruh (revelation) of His command to whom of His servants He wills (saying): \"Warn mankind that none has the right to be worshipped but I, so have Taqwa of Me.\") (16:2), and  وَإِنَّهُ لَتَنزِيلُ رَبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ - نَزَلَ بِهِ الرُّوحُ الاٌّمِينُ - عَلَى قَلْبِكَ لِتَكُونَ مِنَ الْمُنْذِرِينَ  (And truly, this is a revelation from the Lord of all that exits, Which the trustworthy Ruh (Jibril) has brought down Upon your heart that you may be (one) of the warners.) (26:192-194) Allah says:  لِيُنذِرَ يَوْمَ التَّلاَقِ  (that he may warn (men) of the Day of Mutual Meeting.) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas said: \"The Day of Mutual Meeting is one of the names of the Day of Resurrection, of which Allah warns His servants.\" That is the Day when everyone will find out about his deeds, good and bad.  يَوْمَ هُم بَـرِزُونَ لاَ يَخْفَى عَلَى اللَّهِ مِنْهُمْ شَىْءٌ  (The Day when they will come out, nothing of them will be hidden from Allah.) means, they will all appear in the open, with nothing to give them shelter or shade, or cover them. Allah says:  يَوْمَ هُم بَـرِزُونَ لاَ يَخْفَى عَلَى اللَّهِ مِنْهُمْ شَىْءٌ  (The Day when they will come out, nothing of them will be hidden from Allah.) meaning, everything will be equally known to Him.  لِّمَنِ الْمُلْكُ الْيَوْمَ لِلَّهِ الْوَحِدِ الْقَهَّارِ  (Whose is the kingdom this Day It is Allah's, the One, the Irresistible!) We have already mentioned the Hadith of Ibn `Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, that Allah will roll up the heavens and the earth in His Hand and will say,  «أَنَا الْمَلِكُ، أَنَا الْجَبَّارُ، أَنَا الْمُتَكَبِّرُ، أَيْنَ مُلُوكُ الْأَرْضِ؟ أَيْنَ الْجَبَّارُونَ؟ أَيْنَ الْمُتَكَبِّرُونَ؟»  (\"I am the King, I am the Compeller, I am the Proud, where are the kings of the earth Where are the tyrants Where are the proud\") In the Hadith about the Trumpet, it says that Allah will take the souls of all of His creatures, and there will be none left but Him Alone, with no partner or associate. Then He will say, \"Whose is the kingdom today\" three times, and He will answer Himself by saying,  لِلَّهِ الْوَحِدِ الْقَهَّارِ  (It is Allah's, the One, the Irresistible!) meaning, He is the Only One Who has subjugated all things.  الْيَوْمَ تُجْزَى كُلُّ نَفْسٍ بِمَا كَـسَبَتْ لاَ ظُلْمَ الْيَوْمَ إِنَّ اللَّهَ سَرِيعُ الْحِسَابِ  (This Day shall every person be recompensed for what he earned. This Day no injustice (shall be done to anybody). Truly, Allah is swift in reckoning.) Here Allah tells us of His justice when He judges between His creation; He does not do even a speck of dust's weight of injustice, whether it be for good or for evil. For every good deed He gives a tenfold reward and for every bad deed He gives recompense of one bad deed. Allah says:  لاَ ظُلْمَ الْيَوْمَ  (This Day no injustice (shall be done to anybody).) It was reported in Sahih Muslim from Abu Dharr, may Allah be pleased with him, that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said that Allah said:  «يَا عِبَادِي إِنِّي حَرَّمْتُ الظُّلْمَ عَلى نَفْسِي وَجَعَلْتُهُ بَيْنَكُمْ مُحَرَّمًا فَلَا تَظَالَمُوا إلى أن قال يَا عِبَادِي إِنَّمَا هِيَ أَعْمَالُكُمْ أُحْصِيهَا عَلَيْكُمْ ثُمَّ أُوَفِّيكُمْ إِيَّاهَا، فَمَنْ وَجَدَ خَيْرًا فَلْيَحْمَدِ اللهَ تَبَارَكَ وَتَعَالَى، وَمَنْ وَجَدَ غَيْرَ ذَلِكَ فَلَا يَلُومَنَّ إِلَّا نَفْسَه»  (\"O My servants, I have forbidden injustice for Myself, and made it unlawful for you, so do not commit injustice to one another ...\") up to: (\"O My servants, these are your deeds, I record them for you then I will recompense you for them. Whoever finds something good, let him give praise to Allah, and whoever finds something other than that, let him blame no one but himself.\")  إِنَّ اللَّهَ سَرِيعُ الْحِسَابِ  (Truly, Allah is swift in reckoning.) means, He will bring all His creation to account as if He is bringing just one person to account. This is like the Ayah:  مَّا خَلْقُكُمْ وَلاَ بَعْثُكُمْ إِلاَّ كَنَفْسٍ وَحِدَةٍ  (The creation of you all and the resurrection of you all are only as a single person) (31: 28).  وَمَآ أَمْرُنَآ إِلاَّ وَحِدَةٌ كَلَمْحٍ بِالْبَصَرِ  (And Our commandment is but one as the twinkling of an eye.) (54:50) "

  40,20,"<h2>Warning of the Day of Resurrection and Allah's judgement on that Day</h2> `The Day that is drawing near' is one of the names of the Day of Judgement. It is so called because it is close, as Allah says: ﴾أَزِفَتِ الاٌّزِفَةُ - لَيْسَ لَهَا مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ كَاشِفَةٌ ﴿ (The Day of Resurrection draws near. None besides Allah can avert it) (53:57-58) ﴾اقْتَرَبَتِ السَّاعَةُ وَانشَقَّ الْقَمَرُ ﴿ (The Hour has drawn near, and the moon has been cleft asunder) (54:1) ﴾اقْتَرَبَ لِلنَّاسِ حِسَـبُهُمْ﴿ (Draws near for mankind their reckoning) (21:1), ﴾أَتَى أَمْرُ اللَّهِ فَلاَ تَسْتَعْجِلُوهُ﴿ (The Event (the Hour) ordained by Allah will come to pass, so seek not to hasten it) (16:1), ﴾فَلَمَّا رَأَوْهُ زُلْفَةً سِيئَتْ وُجُوهُ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ﴿ (But when they will see it approaching, the faces of those who disbelieve will change and turn black with sadness and in grief) (67:27), and ﴾إِذِ الْقُلُوبُ لَدَى الْحَنَاجِرِ كَـظِمِينَ﴿ (when the hearts will be at the throats Kazimin. ) Qatadah said, \"When the hearts reach the throats because of fear, and they will neither come out nor go back to their places.\" This was also the view of `Ikrimah, As-Suddi and others. ﴾كَـظِمِينَ﴿ (Kazimin) means silent, for no one will speak without His permission: ﴾يَوْمَ يَقُومُ الرُّوحُ وَالْمَلَـئِكَةُ صَفّاً لاَّ يَتَكَلَّمُونَ إِلاَّ مَنْ أَذِنَ لَهُ الرَّحْمَـنُ وَقَالَ صَوَاباً ﴿ (The Day that Ar-Ruh (Jibril) and the angels will stand forth in rows, they will not speak except him whom the Most Gracious allows, and he will speak what is right.) (78:38). Ibn Jurayj said: ﴾كَـظِمِينَ﴿ (Kazimin) \"It means weeping.\" ﴾مَا لِلظَّـلِمِينَ مِنْ حَمِيمٍ وَلاَ شَفِيعٍ يُطَاعُ﴿ (There will be no friend, nor an intercessor for the wrongdoers, who could be given heed to.) means, those who wronged themselves by associating others in worship with Allah, will have no relative to help them and no intercessor who can plead on their behalf; all means of good will be cut off from them. ﴾يَعْلَمُ خَآئِنَةَ الاٌّعْيُنِ وَمَا تُخْفِى الصُّدُورُ ﴿ (Allah knows the fraud of the eyes, and all that the breasts conceal.) Allah tells us about His complete knowledge which encompasses all things, great and small, major and minor, so that people will take note that He knows about them and they will have the proper sense of shyness before Allah. They will pay attention to the fact that He can see them, for He knows the fraud of the eyes, even if the eyes look innocent, and He knows what the hearts conceal. Ad-Dahhak said: ﴾خَآئِنَةَ الاٌّعْيُنِ﴿ (the fraud of the eyes,) \"A wink and a man saying that he has seen something when he has not seen it, or saying that he has not seen it when he did see it.\" Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"Allah knows when the eye looks at something, whether it wants to commit an act of betrayal or not.\" This was also the view of Mujahid and Qatadah. Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, commented on the Ayah: ﴾وَمَا تُخْفِى الصُّدُورُ﴿ (and all that the breasts conceal.)\"He knows, if you were able to, whether you would commit Zina with a woman or not.\" As-Suddi said: ﴾وَمَا تُخْفِى الصُّدُورُ﴿ (and all that the breasts conceal.) meaning, of insinuating whispers. ﴾وَاللَّهُ يَقْضِى بِالْحَقِّ﴿ (And Allah judges with truth, ) means, He judges with justice. Al-A`mash narrated from Sa`id bin Jubayr from Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, that this Ayah means: \"He is able to reward those who do good with good and those who do evil with evil.\" ﴾إِنَّ اللَّهَ هُوَ السَّمِيعُ الْبَصِيرُ﴿ (Certainly, Allah! He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer.) This is how it was interpreted by Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him. This is like the Ayah: ﴾لِيَجْزِىَ الَّذِينَ أَسَاءُواْ بِمَا عَمِلُواْ وَيِجْزِى الَّذِينَ أَحْسَنُواْ بِالْحُسْنَى﴿ (that He may requite those who do evil with that which they have done, and reward those who do good, with what is best) (53:31). ﴾وَالَّذِينَ يَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِهِ﴿ (while those to whom they invoke besides Him,) means, the idols and false gods, ﴾لاَ يَقْضُونَ بِشَىْءٍ﴿ (cannot judge anything.) means, they do not possess anything and they cannot judge anything. ﴾إِنَّ اللَّهَ هُوَ السَّمِيعُ الْبَصِيرُ﴿ (Certainly, Allah! He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer.) means, He hears all that His creatures say and He knows all about them, so He guides whomsoever He wills and sends astray whomsoever He wills. And He judges with perfect justice in all of that. "

  40,22,"<h2>The Severe Punishment for the Disbelievers</h2>﴾أَوَلَمْ يَسيرُواْ﴿ (Have they not traveled), `these people who disbelieve in your Message, O Muhammad,' ﴾فِى الاٌّرْضِ فَيَنظُرُواْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَـقِبَةُ الَّذِينَ كَانُواْ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ﴿ (in the land and seen what was the end of those who were before them) means, the nations of the past who disbelieved in their Prophets (peace be upon them), for which the punishment came upon them even though they were stronger than Quraysh. ﴾وَءَاثَاراً فِى الاٌّرْضِ﴿ (and in the traces in the land.) means, they left behind traces in the earth, such as structures, buildings and dwellings which these people i.e., the Quraysh cannot match. This is like the Ayat: ﴾وَلَقَدْ مَكَّنَـهُمْ فِيمَآ إِن مَّكَّنَّـكُمْ فِيهِ﴿ (And indeed We had firmly established them with that wherewith We have not established you!) (46:26) ﴾وَأَثَارُواْ الاٌّرْضَ وَعَمَرُوهَآ أَكْثَرَ مِمَّا عَمَرُوهَا﴿ (and they tilled the earth and populated it in greater numbers than these have done) (30:9). Yet despite this great strength, Allah punished them for their sin, which was their disbelief in their Messengers. ﴾وَمَا كَانَ لَهُم مِّنَ اللَّهِ مِن وَاقٍ﴿ (And none had they to protect them from Allah.) means, they had no one who could protect them or ward off the punishment from them. Then Allah mentions the reason why He punished them, and the sins which they committed. Allah says: ﴾ذَلِكَ بِأَنَّهُمْ كَانَت تَّأْتِيهِمْ رُسُلُهُم بِالْبَيِّنَـتِ﴿ (That was because there came to them their Messengers with clear evidences) meaning with clear proof and definitive evidence. ﴾فَكَفَرُواْ﴿ (but they disbelieved.) means, despite all these signs, they disbelieved and rejected the Message. ﴾فَأَخَذَهُمُ اللَّهُ﴿ (So Allah seized them.) means, He destroyed them utterly, and a similar fate awaits the disbelievers. ﴾إِنَّهُ قَوِىٌّ شَدِيدُ الْعِقَابِ﴿ (Verily, He is All-Strong, Severe in punishment) means, He is possessed of great strength and might. ﴾شَدِيدُ الْعِقَابِ﴿ (Severe in punishment, ) means, His punishment is severe and agonizing; we seek refuge with Allah, may He be blessed and exalted, from that.
