tafsir[7]{c,v,t}:
  18,28,"<h2>The Command to recite the Qur'an and to patiently keep Company with the Believers</h2> Commanding His Messenger to recite His Holy Book and convey it to mankind, Allah says,  لاَ مُبَدِّلَ لِكَلِمَـتِهِ  (None can change His Words,) meaning, no one can alter them, distort them or misinterpret them.  وَلَن تَجِدَ مِن دُونِهِ مُلْتَحَدًا  (and none will you find as a refuge other than Him.) It was reported that Mujahid said, \"A shelter,\" and that Qatadah said, \"A helper or supporter.\" Ibn Jarir said: \"Allah is saying, `if you O Muhammad, do not recite what is revealed to you of the Book of your Lord, then you will have no refuge from Allah.\"' As Allah says:  يَـأَيُّهَا الرَّسُولُ بَلِّغْ مَآ أُنزِلَ إِلَيْكَ مِن رَّبِّكَ وَإِن لَّمْ تَفْعَلْ فَمَا بَلَّغْتَ رِسَالَتَهُ وَاللَّهُ يَعْصِمُكَ مِنَ النَّاسِ  (O Messenger! Proclaim (the Message) which has been sent down to you from your Lord. And if you do not, then you have not conveyed His Message. Allah will protect you from mankind.)5:67  إِنَّ الَّذِى فَرَضَ عَلَيْكَ الْقُرْءَانَ لَرَآدُّكَ إِلَى مَعَادٍ  (Verily, He Who has given you the Qur'an, will surely bring you back to the place of return.) 28:85 meaning, `He will call you to account for the duty of conveying the Message which He entrusted you with. '  وَاصْبِرْ نَفْسَكَ مَعَ الَّذِينَ يَدْعُونَ رَبَّهُم بِالْغَدَاةِ وَالْعَشِىِّ يُرِيدُونَ وَجْهَهُ  (And keep yourself patiently with those who call on their Lord morning and afternoon, seeking His Face;) meaning, sit with those who remember Allah, who say \"La Ilaha Illallah\", who praise Him, glorify Him, declare His greatness and call on Him, morning and evening, all the servants of Allah, whether rich or poor, strong or weak. It was said that this was revealed about the nobles of Quraysh when they asked the Prophet to sit with them on his own, and not to bring his weak Companions with him, such as Bilal, `Ammar, Suhayb, Khabbab and Ibn Mas`ud. They wanted him to sit with them on his own, but Allah forbade him from doing that, and said,  وَلاَ تَطْرُدِ الَّذِينَ يَدْعُونَ رَبَّهُمْ بِالْغَدَاةِ وَالْعَشِىِّ  (And turn not away those who invoke their Lord, morning and afternoon.) Allah commanded him to patiently content himself with sitting with those people (the weak believers), and said:  وَاصْبِرْ نَفْسَكَ مَعَ الَّذِينَ يَدْعُونَ رَبَّهُم بِالْغَدَاةِ وَالْعَشِىِّ  (And keep yourself patiently with those who call on their Lord morning and afternoon...) Imam Muslim recorded in his Sahih that Sa`d bin Abi Waqqas who said: \"There was a group of six of us with the Prophet . The idolators said, `Tell these people to leave so they will not offend us.' There was myself, Ibn Mas`ud, a man from Hudayl, Bilal and two other men whose names I have forgotten. Allah's Messenger ﷺ thought to himself about whatever Allah willed he should think about, then Allah revealed:  وَلاَ تَطْرُدِ الَّذِينَ يَدْعُونَ رَبَّهُمْ بِالْغَدَاةِ وَالْعَشِىِّ يُرِيدُونَ وَجْهَهُ  (And turn not away those who invoke their Lord, morning and afternoon.) Only Muslim reported this; excluding Al-Bukhari.  وَلاَ تَعْدُ عَيْنَاكَ عَنْهُمْ تُرِيدُ زِينَةَ الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا  (and let not your eyes overlook them, desiring the pomp and glitter of the life of the world;) Ibn `Abbas said, `(this means) do not favor others over them, meaning do not seek the people of nobility and wealth instead of them.'  وَلاَ تُطِعْ مَنْ أَغْفَلْنَا قَلْبَهُ عَن ذِكْرِنَا  (and obey not him whose heart We have made heedless of Our remembrance) means, those who are distracted by this world from being committed to the religion and from worshipping their Lord.  وَكَانَ أَمْرُهُ فُرُطًا  (and whose affair (deeds) has been lost.) means, his actions and deeds are a foolish waste of time. Do not obey him or admire his way or envy what he has. As Allah says elsewhere:  وَلاَ تَمُدَّنَّ عَيْنَيْكَ إِلَى مَا مَتَّعْنَا بِهِ أَزْوَجاً مِّنْهُمْ زَهْرَةَ الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا لِنَفْتِنَهُمْ فِيهِ وَرِزْقُ رَبِّكَ خَيْرٌ وَأَبْقَى  (And strain not your eyes in longing for the things We have given for enjoyment to various groups of them, the splendor of the life of this world, that We may test them thereby. But the provision of your Lord is better and more lasting.) 20:131 "
  18,29,"<h2>The Truth is from Allah, and the Punishment of Those Who do not believe in it</h2> Allah says to His Messenger Muhammad ﷺ: \"Say to the people, `What I have brought to you from your Lord is the truth, in which there is no confusion or doubt.\"'  فَمَن شَآءَ فَلْيُؤْمِن وَمَن شَآءَ فَلْيَكْفُرْ  (Then whosoever wills, let him believe; and whosoever wills, let him disbelieve.) This is a type of threat and stern warning, after which Allah says,  إِنَّآ أَعْتَدْنَا  (Verily, We have prepared), meaning made ready,  لِّلظَّـلِمِينَ  (for the wrongdoers,) meaning those who disbelieve in Allah, His Messenger and His Book,  نَارًا أَحَاطَ بِهِمْ سُرَادِقُهَا  (a Fire whose walls will be surrounding them.) Ibn Jurayj said that Ibn `Abbas said,  أَحَاطَ بِهِمْ سُرَادِقُهَا  (a Fire whose walls will be surrounding them.) \"A wall of fire.\"  وَإِن يَسْتَغِيثُواْ يُغَاثُواْ بِمَآءٍ كَالْمُهْلِ يَشْوِى الْوجُوهَ  (And if they ask for drink, they will be granted water like Al-Muhl, that will scald their faces.) Ibn `Abbas said; \"Al-Muhl is thick water which is similar to the sediment in oil.\" Mujahid said, \"It is like blood and pus.\" `Ikrimah said, \"It is the thing that is heated to the ultimate temperature.\" Others said: \"It is everything that is melted.\" Qatadah said, \"Ibn Mas`ud melted some gold in a grove, and when it became liquid and foam rose to the top, he said, this is the thing that is most like Al-Muhl.\" Ad-Dahhak said: \"The water of Hell is black, and it itself is black and its people are black.\" There is nothing contradictory in these comments, for Al-Muhl includes all of these unpleasant characteristics, it is black, evil-smelling, thick and hot, as Allah said,  يَشْوِى الْوجُوهَ  (it will scald their faces.) meaning because of its heat. When the disbeliever wants to drink it and brings it close to his face, it will scald it so that the skin of his face falls off into it. Sa`id bin Jubayr said, \"When the people of Hell get hungry, they will ask for relief from it, and they will be given the tree of Zaqqum from which they will eat. The tree will tear off the skin of their faces, and if anyone who knew them were to pass by, he would recognize the skin of their faces in the tree. Then they will feel thirsty, so they will ask for drink, and they will be granted water like Al-Muhl, that is what has been heated to the ultimate temperature. When it is brought near their mouths, the flesh of their faces from which the skin has been torn off will be baked.\" After describing this drink in these horrifying qualities, Allah says:  بِئْسَ الشَّرَابُ  (Terrible is the drink,) meaning, how awful this drink is. Similarly, He says in another Ayah:  وَسُقُواْ مَآءً حَمِيماً فَقَطَّعَ أَمْعَآءَهُمْ  (and be given to drink boiling water so that it cuts up their bowels.) 47:15  تُسْقَى مِنْ عَيْنٍ ءَانِيَةٍ  (They will be given to drink from a boiling spring.) 88:5  وَبَيْنَ حَمِيمٍ ءَانٍ  (They will go between it (Hell) and the fierce boiling water.) 55:44  وَسَآءَتْ مُرْتَفَقًا  (and an evil Murtafaq!) means, how evil a place is the Fire to dwell and rest and gather. As Allah says elsewhere:  إِنَّهَا سَآءَتْ مُسْتَقَرّاً وَمُقَاماً  (Evil indeed it (Hell) is as an abode and as a place to rest in.) 25:66 "

  18,31,"<h2>The Reward of those Who believe and do Righteous Deeds</h2> When Allah mentions the state of those who are doomed, He follows that by mentioning the blessed who believed in Allah and believed what His Messengers brought, those who did the righteous deeds that they commanded them to do. They will have Jannatu `Adn. `Adn means lasting. ﴾تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهِمُ الاٌّنْهَـرُ﴿ (wherein rivers flow beneath them,) means, from beneath its rooms and dwellings. Fir`awn said: ﴾وَهَـذِهِ الاٌّنْهَـرُ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِى﴿ (and these rivers flowing beneath me...) 43:51 ﴾يُحَلَّوْنَ﴿ (they will be adorned) means, with jewelry. ﴾فِيهَا مِنْ أَسَاوِرَ مِن ذَهَبٍ﴿ (with bracelets of gold,) Allah says elsewhere: ﴾وَلُؤْلُؤاً وَلِبَاسُهُمْ فِيهَا حَرِيرٌ﴿ (and pearls and their garments therein will be of silk) 22:23. This is explained in more detail here, where Allah says: ﴾وَيَلْبَسُونَ ثِيَابًا خُضْرًا مِّن سُنْدُسٍ وَإِسْتَبْرَقٍ﴿ (and they will wear green garments of Sundus and Istabraq.) Sundus refers to a fine garment, like a shirt and the like, and Istabraq is thick and shiny velvet. ﴾مُّتَّكِئِينَ فِيهَا عَلَى الاٌّرَائِكِ﴿ (They will be Muttaki'in therein on Ara'ik.) The word Muttaki'in implies lying down, or it was said that it means sitting with one's legs crossed, which is closer to the meaning here. In a Sahih Hadith, the Prophet said: ﴾«أَمَّا أَنَا فَلَا آكُلُ مُتَّكِئًا»﴿ (As for me, I do not eat sitting with legs crossed (Muttaki'an)). Ara'ik is the plural of Arikah, which is a bed under a canopy. And Allah knows best. ﴾نِعْمَ الثَّوَابُ وَحَسُنَتْ مُرْتَفَقاً﴿ (How good is the reward, and what an excellent place of rest (Murtafaq)!) means, how blessed is Paradise as a reward for their good deeds. And what an excellent Murtafaq means, and how good a place to dwell and rest and stay. Previously, Allah had said of Hell, ﴾بِئْسَ الشَّرَابُ وَسَآءَتْ مُرْتَفَقًا﴿ (Terrible is the drink, and an evil place of rest (Murtafaq)!) 18:29. In a similar way, He contrasts the two (Paradise and Hell) in Surat Al-Furqan, where He says: ﴾إِنَّهَا سَآءَتْ مُسْتَقَرّاً وَمُقَاماً ﴿ (Evil indeed it (Hell) is as an abode, and as a place to rest in.) 25:66. Then He mentions the qualities of the believers, then says: ﴾أُوْلَـئِكَ يُجْزَوْنَ الْغُرْفَةَ بِمَا صَبَرُواْ وَيُلَقَّوْنَ فِيهَا تَحِيَّةً وَسَلَـماً - خَـلِدِينَ فِيهَا حَسُنَتْ مُسْتَقَرّاً وَمُقَاماً ﴿ (Those will be rewarded with the highest place because of their patience. Therein they shall be met with greetings and the word of peace and respect. Abiding therein excellent it is as an abode, and as a place to rest in.) 25:75-76 "
