  3,17,"<h2>The Supplication and Description of Al-Muttaqin</h2> Allah describes the Muttaqin, His pious servants, whom He promised tremendous rewards,  الَّذِينَ يَقُولُونَ رَبَّنَآ إِنَّنَآ ءَامَنَّا  (Those who say: \"Our Lord! We have indeed believed\") in You, Your Book and Your Messenger.  فَاغْفِرْ لَنَا ذُنُوبَنَا  (so forgive us our sins) because of our faith in You and in what You legislated for us. Therefore, forgive us our errors and shortcomings, with Your bounty and mercy,  وَقِنَا عَذَابَ النَّارِ  (and save us from the punishment of the Fire.)  Allah then said,  الصَّـبِرِينَ  ((They are) those who are patient) while performing acts of obedience and abandoning the prohibitions.  وَالصَّـدِقِينَ  (those who are true) concerning their proclamation of faith, by performing the difficult deeds.  وَالْقَـنِتِينَ  (and obedient) meaning, they submit and obey Allah,  وَالْمُنَـفِقِينَ  (those who spend) from their wealth on all the acts of obedience they were commanded, being kind to kith and kin, helping the needy, and comforting the destitute.  وَالْمُسْتَغْفِرِينَ بِالاٌّسْحَارِ  (and those who pray and beg Allah's pardon in the last hours of the night) and this testifies to the virtue of seeking Allah's forgiveness in the latter part of the night. It was reported that when Ya`qub said to his children,  سَوْفَ أَسْتَغْفِرُ لَكُمْ رَبِّى  (I will ask my Lord for forgiveness for you) 12:98 he waited until the latter part of the night to say his supplication.  Furthermore, the Two Sahihs, the Musnad and Sunan collections recorded through several Companions that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,  «يَنْزِلُ اللهُ تَبَارَكَ وَتَعَالى فِي كُلِّ لَيْلَةٍ إِلى سَمَاءِ الدُّنْيَا حِينَ يَبْقَى ثُلُثُ اللَّيْلِ الْآخِرُ، فَيَقُولُ: هَلْ مِنْ سَائِلٍ فَأُعْطِيَهُ؟ هَلْ مِنْ دَاعٍ فَأَسْتَجِيبَ لَهُ؟ هَلْ مِنْ مُسْتَغْفِرٍ فَأَغْفِرَ لَهُ؟»  (Every night, when the last third of it remains, our Lord, the Blessed, the Superior, descends to the lowest heaven saying, \"Is there anyone to ask Me, so that I may grant him his request Is there anyone to invoke Me, so that I may respond to his invocation Is there anyone seeking My forgiveness, so that I may forgive him\")  The Two Sahihs recorded that `A'ishah said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ performed Witr during the first part, the middle and latter parts of the night. Then, later (in his life), he would perform it (only) during the latter part.\" `Abdullah bin `Umar used to pray during the night and would ask, \"O Nafi`! Is it the latter part of the night yet\" and if Nafi` said, \"Yes,\" Ibn `Umar would start supplicating to Allah and seeking His forgiveness until dawn. This Hadith was collected by Ibn Abi Hatim. "

  3,20,"<h2>The Testimony of Tawhid</h2> Allah bears witness, and verily, Allah is sufficient as a Witness, and He is the Most Truthful and Just Witness there is; His statement is the absolute truth, ﴾أَنَّهُ لاَ إِلَـهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ﴿ (that La ilaha illa Huwa) meaning, He Alone is the Lord and God of all creation; everyone and everything are His servants, creation and in need of Him. Allah is the Most Rich, Free from needing anyone or anything. Allah said in another Ayah, ﴾لَّـكِنِ اللَّهُ يَشْهَدُ بِمَآ أَنزَلَ إِلَيْكَ﴿ (But Allah bears witness to that which He has sent down (the Qur'an) unto you (O Muhammad )) 4:166.  Allah then mentioned the testimony of His angels and those who have knowledge after he mentioned His own testimony, ﴾شَهِدَ اللَّهُ أَنَّهُ لاَ إِلَـهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ وَالْمَلَـئِكَةُ وَأُوْلُواْ الْعِلْمِ﴿ (Allah bears witness that none has the right to be worshipped but He), and the angels, and those having knowledge (also bear witness to this)). This Ayah emphasizes the great virtue of those who have knowledge. ﴾قَآئِمَاً بِالْقِسْطِ﴿ ((He) maintains His creation in justice) in all that He does, ﴾لاَ إِلَـهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ﴿ (None has the right to be worshipped but He) thus emphasizing this fact, ﴾العَزِيزُ الحَكِيمُ﴿ (the Almighty, the All-Wise.) the Mighty that does not submit to weakness due to His might and greatness, the Wise in all His statements, actions, legislation and decrees. <h2>The Religion with Allah is Islam</h2> Allah said, ﴾إِنَّ الدِّينَ عِندَ اللَّهِ الإِسْلَـمُ﴿ (Truly, the religion with Allah is Islam.) Allah states that there is no religion accepted with Him from any person, except Islam. Islam includes obeying all of the Messengers until Muhammad who finalized their commission, thus closing all paths to Allah except through Muhammad . Therefore, after Allah sent Muhammad , whoever meets Allah following a path other than Muhammad's, it will not be accepted of him. In another Ayah, Allah said, ﴾وَمَن يَبْتَغِ غَيْرَ الإِسْلَـمِ دِينًا فَلَن يُقْبَلَ مِنْهُ﴿ (And whoever seeks a religion other than Islam, it will never be accepted of him) 3:85.  In this Ayah 3:19, Allah said, asserting that the only religion accepted with Him is Islam, ﴾إِنَّ الدِّينَ عِندَ اللَّهِ الإِسْلَـمُ﴿ (Truly, the religion with Allah is Islam.)  Allah then states that those who were given the Scripture beforehand divided in the religion after Allah sent the Messengers and revealed the Books to them providing them the necessary proofs to not do so. Allah said, ﴾وَمَا اخْتَلَفَ الَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ الْكِتَـبَ إِلاَّ مِن بَعْدِ مَا جَآءَهُمُ الْعِلْمُ بَغْيًا بَيْنَهُمْ﴿ (Those who were given the Scripture (Jews and Christians) did not differ except out of rivalry, after knowledge had come to them.) meaning, some of them wronged others. Therefore, they differed over the truth, out of envy, hatred and enmity for each other. This hatred made some of them defy those whom they hated even if they were correct. Allah then said, ﴾وَمَن يَكْفُرْ بِآيَـتِ اللَّهِ﴿ (And whoever disbelieves in the Ayat of Allah) meaning, whoever rejects what Allah sent down in His Book, ﴾فَإِنَّ اللَّهِ سَرِيعُ الْحِسَابِ﴿ (then surely, Allah is Swift in reckoning.) Allah will punish him for his rejection, reckon him for his denial, and torment him for defying His Book. Thereafter, Allah said. ﴾فَإنْ حَآجُّوكَ﴿ (So if they dispute with you (Muhammad )) so if they argue with you about Tawhid, ﴾فَقُلْ أَسْلَمْتُ وَجْهِىَ للَّهِ وَمَنِ اتَّبَعَنِ﴿ (Say: \"I have submitted myself to Allah (in Islam), and (so have) those who follow me\") meaning, Say, `I have made my worship sincere for Allah Alone without partners, rivals, offspring or companion, ﴾وَمَنِ اتَّبَعَنِ﴿ (and those who follow me) who followed my religion and embraced my creed.' In another Ayah, Allah said, ﴾قُلْ هَـذِهِ سَبِيلِى أَدْعُو إِلَى اللَّهِ عَلَى بَصِيرَةٍ أَنَاْ وَمَنِ اتَّبَعَنِى﴿ (Say (O Muhammad ): \"This is my way; I invite unto Allah with sure knowledge, I and whosoever follows me...\") 12:108. <h2>Islam is the Religion of Mankind and the Prophet Was Sent to all Mankind</h2> Allah commanded His servant and Messenger, Muhammad , to call the People of the Two Scriptures and the unlettered idolators to his religion, way, Law and all that Allah sent him with. Allah said, ﴾وَقُلْ لِّلَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ الْكِتَـبَ وَالاٍّمِّيِّينَ ءَأَسْلَمْتُمْ فَإِنْ أَسْلَمُواْ فَقَدِ اهْتَدَواْ وَّإِن تَوَلَّوْاْ فَإِنَّمَا عَلَيْكَ الْبَلَـغُ﴿ (And say to those who were given the Scripture (Jews and Christians) and to those who are illiterates (Arab pagans): \"Do you (also) submit yourselves\" If they do, they are rightly guided; but if they turn away, your duty is only to convey the Message.) meaning, their reckoning is with Allah and their return and final destination is to Him. It is He Who guides whom He wills and allows whom He wills to stray, and He has the perfect wisdom and the unequivocal proof for all of this. This is why Allah said, ﴾وَاللَّهُ بَصِيرٌ بِالْعِبَادِ﴿ (And Allah sees the servants.) for He has perfect knowledge of who deserves to be guided and who does not deserve to be guided. Verily, ﴾لاَ يُسْأَلُ عَمَّا يَفْعَلُ وَهُمْ يُسْـَلُونَ ﴿ (He cannot be questioned for what He does, while they will be questioned.) 21:23 because of His perfect wisdom and mercy. This and similar Ayat are clear proofs that the Message of Muhammad is universal to all creation, as it is well established in the religion, according to the various texts of the Book and Sunnah. For instance, Allah said, ﴾قُلْ يَأَيُّهَا النَّاسُ إِنِّى رَسُولُ اللَّهِ إِلَيْكُمْ جَمِيعًا﴿ (Say (O Muhammad ): \"O mankind! Verily, I am sent to you all as the Messenger of Allah.\") 7:158, and, ﴾تَبَارَكَ الَّذِى نَزَّلَ الْفُرْقَانَ عَلَى عَبْدِهِ لِيَكُونَ لِلْعَـلَمِينَ نَذِيراً ﴿ (Blessed be He Who sent down the criterion to His servant that he may be a warner to the `Alamin (mankind and Jinn).) 25:1.  The Two Sahihs and other collections of Hadith recorded that the Prophet sent letters to the kings of the earth during his time and to different peoples, Arabs and non-Arabs, People of the Book and the unlettered, just as Allah had commanded him. `Abdur-Razzaq recorded that Ma`mar said, that Hammam said that Abu Hurayrah said that the Prophet said, ﴾«وَالَّذِي نَفْسِي بِيَدِهِ، لَا يَسْمَعُ بِي أَحَدٌ مِنْ هَذِهِ الْأُمَّةِ: يَهُودِيٌّ وَلَا نَصْرَانِيٌّ، وَمَاتَ وَلَمْ يُؤْمِنْ بِالَّذِي أُرْسِلْتُ بِهِ، إِلَّا كَانَ مِنْ أَهْلِ النَّار»﴿ (By He in Whose Hand is my soul! No member of this Ummah, no Jew or Christian, hears of me but dies without believing in what I was sent with, but will be among the people of the Fire.) Muslim recorded this Hadith.  The Prophet said, ﴾«بُعِثْتُ إِلَى الْأَحْمَرِ وَالْأَسْوَد»﴿ (I was sent to the red and black. ) and, ﴾«كَانَ النَّبِيُّ يُبْعَثُ إِلى قَوْمِهِ خَاصَّةً، وَبُعِثْتُ إِلَى النَّاسِ عَامَّة»﴿ (A Prophet used to be sent to his people, but I was sent to all mankind.)

  3,22,"<h2>Chastising the Jews for Their Disbelief and for Killing the Prophets and Righteous People</h2> This Ayah chastises the People of the Book for the transgression and prohibitions they committed by their denials in the past and more recent times, of Allah's Ayat and the Messengers. They did this due to their defiance and rejection of the Messengers, denial of the truth and refusal to follow it. They also killed many Prophets when they conveyed to them what Allah legislated for them, without cause or criminal behavior committed by these Prophets, for they only called them to the truth, ﴾وَيَقْتُلُونَ الَّذِينَ يَأْمُرُونَ بِالْقِسْطِ مِنَ النَّاسِ﴿ (And kill those men who order just dealings) thus, demonstrating the worst type of arrogance. Indeed, the Prophet said, ﴾«الْكِبْرُ بَطَرُ الْحَقِّ وَغَمْطُ النَّاس»﴿ (Kibr (arrogance) is refusing the truth and degrading people)  This is why when they rejected the truth and acted arrogantly towards the creation, Allah punished them with humiliation and disgrace in this life, and humiliating torment in the Hereafter. Allah said, ﴾فَبَشِّرْهُمْ بِعَذَابٍ أَلِيمٍ ﴿ (then announce to them a painful torment) meaning, painful and humiliating, ﴾أُولَـئِكَ الَّذِينَ حَبِطَتْ أَعْمَـلُهُمْ فِي الدُّنْيَا وَالاٌّخِرَةِ وَمَا لَهُم مِّن نَّـصِرِينَ ﴿ (They are those whose works will be lost in this world and in the Hereafter, and they will have no helpers. ).
