  13,35,"<h2>Punishment of the Disbelievers and Reward of the Pious Believers</h2> Here, Allah mentions the punishment of the disbelievers and the reward of the righteous believers, after describing the Kufr and Shirk that the disbelievers indulge in,  لَّهُمْ عَذَابٌ فِى الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا  (For them is a torment in the life of this world,) by the hands of the believers, killing and capturing them,  وَلَعَذَابُ الاٌّخِرَةِ  (and certainly, the torment of the Hereafter.) which will come after they suffer humiliation in this life,  أَشُقَّ  (is harder) many times harder. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to those who agreed to Mula`anah,  «إِنَّ عَذَابَ الدُّنْيَا أَهْوَنُ مِنْ عَذَابِ الْآخِرَة»  (Surely, the torment of this life, is easier than the torment of the Hereafter.) Indeed, and just as the Messenger of Allah ﷺ stated, the torment of this life ends but the torment of the Hereafter is everlasting in a Fire that is seventy times hot than our fire, where there are chains whose thickness and hardness are unimaginable. Allah said in other Ayat,  فَيَوْمَئِذٍ لاَّ يُعَذِّبُ عَذَابَهُ أَحَدٌ - وَلاَ يُوثِقُ وَثَاقَهُ أَحَدٌ  (So on that Day none will punish as He will punish. And none will bind as He will bind.)89:25-26, and,  بَلْ كَذَّبُواْ بِالسَّاعَةِ وَأَعْتَدْنَا لِمَن كَذَّبَ بِالسَّاعَةِ سَعِيراً - إِذَا رَأَتْهُمْ مِّن مَّكَانٍ بَعِيدٍ سَمِعُواْ لَهَا تَغَيُّظاً وَزَفِيراً - وَإَذَآ أُلْقُواْ مِنْهَا مَكَاناً ضَيِّقاً مُّقَرَّنِينَ دَعَوْاْ هُنَالِكَ ثُبُوراً - لاَّ تَدْعُواْ الْيَوْمَ ثُبُوراً وَحِداً وَادْعُواْ ثُبُوراً كَثِيراً - قُلْ أَذَلِكَ خَيْرٌ أَمْ جَنَّةُ الْخُلْدِ الَّتِى وَعِدَ الْمُتَّقُونَ كَانَتْ لَهُمْ جَزَآءً وَمَصِيراً  (And for those who deny the Hour, We have prepared a flaming Fire. When it (Hell) sees them from a far place, they will hear its raging and its roaring. And when they shall be thrown into a narrow place thereof, chained together, they will exclaim therein for destruction. Exclaim not today for one destruction, but exclaim for many destructions. Say: \"Is that (torment) better, or the Paradise of Eternity promised for those who have Taqwa\" It will be theirs as a reward and as a final destination.) 25:11-15 Similarly He said;  مَّثَلُ الْجَنَّةِ الَّتِى وُعِدَ الْمُتَّقُونَ  (The description of the Paradise which those who have Taqwa have been promised) meaning its description and qualities;  تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهَا الأَنْهَـرُ  (Underneath it rivers flow,) these rivers flow in the various parts and grades of Paradise and wherever its people wish they flow and gush forth for them. Allah also said,  مَّثَلُ الْجَنَّةِ الَّتِى وُعِدَ الْمُتَّقُونَ فِيهَآ أَنْهَارٌ مِّن مَّآءٍ غَيْرِ ءَاسِنٍ وَأَنْهَارٌ مِّن لَّبَنٍ لَّمْ يَتَغَيَّرْ طَعْمُهُ وَأَنْهَـرٌ مِّنْ خَمْرٍ لَّذَّةٍ لِّلشَّـرِبِينَ وَأَنْهَـرٌ مِّنْ عَسَلٍ مُّصَفًّى وَلَهُمْ فِيهَا مِن كُلِّ الثَّمَرَتِ وَمَغْفِرَةٌ  (The description of Paradise which those who have Taqwa have been promised (is that) in it are rivers of water the taste and smell of which are not changed, rivers of wine delicious to those who drink, and rivers of clarified honey, therein for them is every kind of fruit, and forgiveness.) 47:15 Allah said next,  أُكُلُهَا دَآئِمٌ وِظِلُّهَا  (its provision is eternal and so is its shade) for Paradise has foods, fruits and drinks that never end or finish. It is recorded in the Two Sahihs that Ibn `Abbas narrated in the Hadith about the Eclipse prayer that the Companions said, \"O Allah's Messenger! While you were standing in prayer, we saw you reach for something with your hand and then you brought it back.\" The Messenger ﷺ said,  «إِنِّي رَأَيْتُ الْجَنَّةَ أَوْ أُرِيتُ الْجَنَّةَ فَتَنَاوَلْتُ مِنْهَا عُنْقُودًا، وَلَوْ أَخَذْتُهُ لَأَكَلْتُمْ مِنْهُ مَا بَقِيَتِ الدُّنْيَا»  (I saw Paradise - or was shown Paradise - and reached for a cluster (of grapes or other fruit), and had I kept it, you would have eaten from it as long as this life remains.) iImam Muslim recorded that Jabir bin `Abdullah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,  «يَأْكُلُ أَهْلُ الْجَنَّةِ وَيَشْرَبُونَ، وَلَا يَتَمَخَّطُونَ وَلَا يَتَغَوَّطُونَ، وَلَا يَبُولُونَ، طَعَامُهُمْ جُشَاءٌ كَرِيحِ الْمِسْكِ، وَيُلْهَمُونَ التَّسْبِيحَ وَالتَّقْدِيسَ كَمَا يُلْهَمُونَ النَّفَس»  (The people of Paradise eat and drink, and they do not need to blow their noses, or answer the call of nature, or urinate, for they pass the food excrements in belches, which smell like musk. They will be inspired to praise and glorify (Allah) as spontaneously as they breathe.) Imams Ahmad and An-Nasa'i recorded that Thumamah bin `Uqbah said that he heard Zayd bin Arqam say, \"A man from the People of the Scriptures came and said to the Prophet , `O Abul-Qasim! You claim that the people of Paradise eat and drink' The Prophet ﷺ said,  «نَعَمْ، وَالَّذِي نَفْسُ مُحَمَّدٍ بِيَدِهِ، إِنَّ الرَّجُلَ مِنْهُمْ لَيُعطَى قُوَّةَ مِائَةِ رَجُلٍ فِي الْأَكْلِ وَالشُّرْبِ وَالْجِمَاعِ وَالشَّهْوَة»  (Yes. By He in Whose Hand is Muhammad's life, a man among them will be given the strength of a hundred men in eating, drinking, sexual intercourse and appetite.) That man asked, `He who eats and drinks needs to relieve the call of nature, but Paradise is pure from feces and urine' The Prophet said,  «تَكُونُ حَاجَةُ أَحَدِهِمْ رَشْحًا يَفِيضُ مِنْ جُلُودِهِمْ كَرِيحِ الْمِسْكِ فَيَضْمُرُ بَطْنُه»  (One of them (residents of Paradise) relieves the call of nature through a sweat that emanates from the skin, with the scent of musk, and the stomach becomes empty again.) Imam Ahmad and An-Nasa'i collected this Hadith. Allah said in other Ayat,  وَفَـكِهَةٍ كَثِيرَةٍ - لاَّ مَقْطُوعَةٍ وَلاَ مَمْنُوعَةٍ  (And fruit in plenty, whose supply is not cut off nor are they out of reach.)56:32-33, and,  وَدَانِيَةً عَلَيْهِمْ ظِلَـلُهَا وَذُلِّلَتْ قُطُوفُهَا تَذْلِيلاً  (And the shade thereof is close upon them, and the bunches of fruit thereof will hang low within their reach.)76:14 The shade of Paradise is everlasting and never shrinks, just as Allah said,  وَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّـلِحَـتِ سَنُدْخِلُهُمْ جَنَّـتٍ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهَا الاٌّنْهَـرُ خَـلِدِينَ فِيهَآ أَبَداً لَّهُمْ فِيهَآ أَزْوَجٌ مُّطَهَّرَةٌ وَنُدْخِلُهُمْ ظِـلاًّ ظَلِيلاً  (But those who believe and do deeds of righteousness, We shall admit them to Gardens under which rivers flow, abiding therein forever. Therein they shall have pure mates, and We shall admit them to shades wide and ever deepening.)4:57 Allah often mentions the description of Paradise and the description of the Fire together, to make Paradise appealing and warn against the Fire. This is why, after Allah mentioned the description of Paradise here, He next said,  تِلْكَ عُقْبَى الَّذِينَ اتَّقَواْ وَّعُقْبَى الْكَـفِرِينَ النَّارُ  (this is the end (final destination) of those who have Taqwa, and the end (final destination) of the disbelievers is Fire.) Allah said in another Ayah ,  لاَ يَسْتَوِى أَصْحَـبُ النَّارِ وَأَصْحَـبُ الْجَنَّةِ أَصْحَـبُ الْجَنَّةِ هُمُ الْفَآئِزُونَ  (Not equal are the dwellers of the Fire and the dwellers of the Paradise. It is the dwellers of Paradise that will be successful.) 59:20 "

  13,37,"<h2>The Truthful Ones from among the People of the Scriptures rejoice at what Allah has revealed to Muhammad ﷺ</h2> Allah said,  وَالَّذِينَ ءَاتَيْنَـهُمُ الْكِتَـبَ  (Those to whom We have given the Book,) and they adhere by it,  يَفْرَحُونَ بِمَآ أُنزِلَ إِلَيْكَ  (rejoice at what has been revealed unto you,) i.e. the Qur'an, because they have evidence in their Books affirming the truth of the Qur'an and conveying the good news of its imminent revelation, just as Allah said in another Ayah,  الَّذِينَ آتَيْنَـهُمُ الْكِتَـبَ يَتْلُونَهُ حَقَّ تِلاَوَتِهِ  (Those to whom We gave the Book recite it as it should be recited.) 2:121 Allah said,  قُلْ ءَامِنُواْ بِهِ أَوْ لاَ تُؤْمِنُواْ  (Say: \"Believe in it (the Qur'an) or do not believe.\") 17:107, until,  إِن كَانَ وَعْدُ رَبِّنَا لَمَفْعُولاً  (Truly, the promise of our Lord must be fulfilled.) 17:109 meaning, Allah's promise to us in our Books to send Muhammad ﷺ is true. It is certain and will surely come to pass and be fulfilled, so all praise to our Lord, how truthful is His promise, all the thanks are due to Him,  وَيَخِرُّونَ لِلاٌّذْقَانِ يَبْكُونَ وَيَزِيدُهُمْ خُشُوعًا  (And they fall down on their faces weeping and it increases their humility.) 17:109 Allah said next,  وَمِنَ الاٌّحْزَابِ مَن يُنكِرُ بَعْضَهُ  (but there are among the Ahzab (Confederates) those who reject a part thereof.) meaning, `There are those among the sects who disbelieve in some of what was revealed to you (O Muhammad).' Mujahid said that,  وَمِنَ الاٌّحْزَابِ  (but there are among the Ahzab (Confederates)), refers to Jews and Christians,  مَن يُنكِرُ بَعْضَهُ  (those who reject a part thereof), meaning, `They reject a part of the truth that came down to you - O Muhammad.' Similar was reported from Qatadah and `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam. Allah said in similar Ayat,  وَإِنَّ مِنْ أَهْلِ الْكِتَـبِ لَمَن يُؤْمِنُ بِاللَّهِ  (And there are, certainly, among the People of the Scripture, those who believe in Allah.) 3:199 Allah said next,  قُلْ إِنَّمَآ أُمِرْتُ أَنْ أَعْبُدَ اللَّهَ وَلا أُشْرِكَ بِهِ  (Say: \"I am commanded only to worship Allah and not to join partners with Him...\") meaning, `I (Muhammad) was sent with the religion of worshipping Allah alone without partners, just as the Messengers before me,  إِلَيْهِ أَدْعُو  (To Him (alone) I call), I call the people to His path,  وَإِلَيْهِ مَآبِ  (and to Him is my return.) final destination and destiny.' Allah said,  وَكَذلِكَ أَنزَلْنَاهُ حُكْمًا عَرَبِيًّا  (And thus have We sent it (the Qur'an) down to be a judgement of authority in Arabic.) Allah says, `Just as We sent Messengers before you and revealed to them Divine Books from heaven, We sent down to you the Qur'an, a judgement of authority in Arabic, as an honor for you, and We preferred you among all people with this clear, plain and unequivocal Book that,  لاَّ يَأْتِيهِ الْبَـطِلُ مِن بَيْنِ يَدَيْهِ وَلاَ مِنْ خَلْفِهِ تَنزِيلٌ مِّنْ حَكِيمٍ حَمِيدٍ  (Falsehood cannot come to it from before it or behind it: (it is) sent down by the All-Wise, Worthy of all praise.)' 41:42 Allah's statement,  وَلَئِنِ اتَّبَعْتَ أَهْوَآءَهُم  (Were you to follow their (vain) desires), means, their opinions,  بَعْدِ مَا جَآءَكَ مِنَ الْعِلْمِ  (after the knowledge which has come to you) from Allah, all praise to Him,  مَا لَكَ مِنَ اللَّهِ مِن وَلِىٍّ وَلاَ وَاقٍ  (then you will not have any Wali (protector) or defender against Allah.) This part of the Ayah warns people of know- ledge against following the paths of misguid- ance after they had gained knowledge in (and abided by) the Prophetic Sunnah and the path of Muhammad ﷺ, may Allah's best peace and blessings be on him. "

  13,39,"<h2>All Prophets and Messengers were Humans</h2> Allah says, `Just as We have sent you O Muhammad, a Prophet and a human, We sent the Messengers before you from among mankind, that eat food, walk in the markets, and We gave them wives and offspring.' Allah said to the most honorable and Final Messenger,  قُلْ إِنَّمَآ أَنَاْ بَشَرٌ مِّثْلُكُمْ يُوحَى إِلَىَّ  (Say: \"I am only a man like you. It has been revealed to me.\") 18:110 It is recorded in the Two Sahihs that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,  «أَمَّا أَنَا فَأَصُومُ وَأُفْطِرُ، وَأَقُومُ وَأَنَامُ، وَآكُلُ اللَّحْمَ، وَأَتَزَوَّجُ النِّسَاءَ، فَمَنْ رَغِبَ عَنْ سُنَّتِي فَلَيْسَ مِنِّي»  (As for me, I fast and break the fast, stand in prayer at night and sleep, eat meat and marry women; so whoever turns away from my Sunnah is not of mine.) <h2>No Prophet can bring a Miracle except by Allah's Leave</h2> Allah said,  وَمَا كَانَ لِرَسُولٍ أَن يَأْتِىَ بِـَايَةٍ إِلاَّ بِإِذْنِ اللَّهِ  (And it was not for a Messenger to bring a sign except by Allah's leave.) meaning, no Prophet could have brought a miracle to his people except by Allah's permission and will, for this matter is only decided by Allah the Exalted and Most Honored, not the Prophets; surely Allah does what He wills and decides what He wills.  لِكُلِّ أَجَلٍ كِتَابٌ  ((For) every matter there is a decree (from Allah).) for every term appointed, there is a record (or decree) that keeps it, and everything has a specific due measure with Allah,  أَلَمْ تَعْلَمْ أَنَّ اللَّهَ يَعْلَمُ مَا فِى السَّمَآءِ وَالاٌّرْضِ إِنَّ ذلِكَ فِى كِتَـبٍ إِنَّ ذلِكَ عَلَى اللَّهِ يَسِيرٌ  (Know you not that Allah knows all that is in the heaven and on the earth Verily, it is (all) in the Book. Verily, that is easy for Allah.)22:70 <h2>Meaning of Allah blotting out what He wills and confirming what He wills of the Book</h2> Allah said,  يَمْحُو اللَّهُ مَا يَشَآءُ  (Allah blots out what He wills) of the divinely revealed Books,  وَيُثَبِّتْ  (and confirms), until the Qur'an, revealed from Allah to His Messenger peace be upon him, abrogated them all. Mujahid commented;  يَمْحُو اللَّهُ مَا يَشَآءُ وَيُثْبِتُ  (Allah blots out what He wills and confirms (what He wills).) \"Except life and death, misery and happiness i.e., faith and disbelief, for they do not change.\" Mansur said that he asked Mujahid, \"Some of us say in their supplication, `O Allah! If my name is with those who are happy (believers), affirm my name among them, and if my name is among the miserable ones (disbelievers), remove it from among them and place it among the happy ones.\" Mujahid said. \"This supplication is good.\" I met him a year or more later and repeated the same question to him and he recited these Ayat,  إِنَّآ أَنزَلْنَـهُ فِى لَيْلَةٍ مُّبَـرَكَةٍ  (We sent it (this Qur'an) down on a blessed night.) Mujahid commented next, \"During Laylatul-Qadr (Night of the Decrees), Allah decides what provisions and disasters will occur in the next year of. He then brings forward or back (or blots out) whatever He wills. As for the Book containing the records of the happy (believers) and the miserable (disbelievers), it does not change.\" Al-A`mash narrated that Abu Wa'il, Shaqiq bin Salamah said that he used to recite this supplication often, \"O Allah, if You wrote us among the wretched ones, remove this status from us and write us among the blessed ones. If You wrote us among the blessed ones, please let us stay that way, for surely, You blot out and confirm what You will, and with You is the Mother of the Book.\" Ibn Jarir At-Tabari collected this. Similar statements were collected from `Umar bin Al-Khattab and `Abdullah bin Mas`ud, indicating that Allah blots out (or abrogates) and affirms what He wills in the Book of Records. What further supports this meaning is that Imam Ahmad recorded that Thawban said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,  «إِنَّ الرَّجُلَ لَيُحْرَمُ الرِّزْقَ بِالذَّنْبِ يُصِيبُهُ، وَلَا يَرُدُّ الْقَدَرَ إِلَّا الدُّعَاءُ، وَلَا يَزِيدُ فِي الْعُمْرِ إِلَّا الْبِر»  (A man might be deprived of a provision (that was written for him) because of a sin that he commits; only supplication changes Al-Qadar (Predestination); and only Birr (righteousness) can increase the life span.\") An-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah collected this Hadith. There is also a Hadith recorded in the Sahih that affirms that maintaining the ties of the womb increases the life span. Al-`Awfi reported that Ibn `Abbas said about Allah's statement,  يَمْحُو اللَّهُ مَا يَشَآءُ وَيُثْبِتُ وَعِندَهُ أُمُّ الْكِتَـبِ  (Allah blots out what He wills and confirms (what He wills). And with Him is the Mother of the Book.) \"A man might work in Allah's obedience for a while but he reverts to the disobedience of Him and then dies while misguided. This is what Allah blots out, while what He confirms is a man who works in His disobedience, but since goodness was destined for him, he dies after reverting to the obedience of Allah. This is what Allah confirms.\" It was also reported that Sa`id bin Jubayr said that this Ayah is in the meaning of another Ayah,  فَيَغْفِرُ لِمَن يَشَآءُ وَيُعَذِّبُ مَن يَشَآءُ وَاللَّهُ عَلَى كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ  (Then He forgives whom He wills and punishes whom He wills. And Allah is able to do all things.) 2:284 "
  13,40,"1748"
  13,41,"<h2>Punishment is by Allah, and the Messenger's Job is only to convey the Message</h2> Allah said to His Messenger ,  وَإِن مَّا نُرِيَنَّكَ  `(Whether We show you) O Muhammad, part of the disgrace and humiliation We have promised your enemies in this life,  أَوْ نَتَوَفَّيَنَّكَ  (or cause you to die) before that,  فَإِنَّمَا عَلَيْكَ الْبَلَـغُ  (your duty is only to convey We have only sent you to convey to them Allah's Message, and by doing so, you will have fulfilled the mission that was ordained on you,  وَعَلَيْنَا الْحِسَابُ  (and on Us is the reckoning), their reckoning and recompense is on Us.' Allah said in similar Ayat,  فَذَكِّرْ إِنَّمَآ أَنتَ مُذَكِّرٌ - لَّسْتَ عَلَيْهِم بِمُسَيْطِرٍ - إِلاَّ مَن تَوَلَّى وَكَفَرَ - فَيْعَذِّبُهُ اللَّهُ الْعَذَابَ الاٌّكْبَرَ - إِنَّ إِلَيْنَآ إِيَابَهُمْ - ثُمَّ إِنَّ عَلَيْنَا حِسَابَهُمْ  (So remind them - you are only one who reminds. You are not a dictator over them - Save the one who turns away and disbelieves. Then Allah will punish him with the greatest punishment. Verily, to Us will be their return, Then verily, for Us will be their reckoning.)88:21-26 Allah said next,  أَوَلَمْ يَرَوْاْ أَنَّا نَأْتِى الاٌّرْضَ نَنقُصُهَا مِنْ أَطْرَافِهَا  (See they not that We gradually reduce the land from its outlying borders.) Ibn `Abbas commented, \"See they not that We are granting land after land to Muhammad ﷺ\" Al-Hasan and Ad-Dahhak commented that this Ayah refers to Muslims gaining the upper hand over idolators, just as Allah said in another Ayah,  وَلَقَدْ أَهْلَكْنَا مَا حَوْلَكُمْ مِّنَ الْقُرَى  (And indeed We have destroyed towns round about you.) 46:27 "
  13,42,"<h2>The Disbelievers plot, but the Believers gain the Good End</h2> Allah says, ﴾وَقَدْ مَكَرَ الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ﴿ (And verily, those before them did devise plots,) against their Messengers, they wanted to expel them from their land, but Allah devised plots against the disbelievers and gave the good end to those who fear Him. Allah said in other Ayat, ﴾وَإِذْ يَمْكُرُ بِكَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ لِيُثْبِتُوكَ أَوْ يَقْتُلُوكَ أَوْ يُخْرِجُوكَ وَيَمْكُرُونَ وَيَمْكُرُ اللَّهُ وَاللَّهُ خَيْرُ الْمَـكِرِينَ ﴿ (And (remember) when the disbelievers plotted against you to imprison you, or to kill you, or to get you out; they were plotting and Allah too was plotting; and Allah is the Best of those who plot.) 8:30, and, ﴾وَمَكَرُواْ مَكْراً وَمَكَرْنَا مَكْراً وَهُمْ لاَ يَشْعُرُونَ - فَانظُرْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَـقِبَةُ مَكْرِهِمْ أَنَّا دَمَّرْنَـهُمْ وَقَوْمَهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ ﴿ (So they plotted a plot, and We planned a plan, while they perceived not. Then see how was the end of their plot! Verily, We destroyed them and their nation, all together.)27:50,51 Allah said next, ﴾يَعْلَمُ مَا تَكْسِبُ كُلُّ نَفْسٍ﴿ (He knows what every person earns,) meaning, He alone knows all secrets and concealed thoughts and will reckon each person according to his work, ( ﴾وَسَيَعْلَمُ الْكَـفِرُ﴿ and the Kafir (disbeliever) will know ﴾الْكُفَّـرُ﴿ or the Kuffar (disbelievers) according to another way of reciting, ﴾لِمَنْ عُقْبَى الدَّارِ﴿ (who gets the good end.) who will earn the ultimate and final victory, they or the followers of the Messengers. Indeed, the followers of the Messengers will earn the good end in this life and the Hereafter, all thanks and praise is due to Allah. "
