tafsir[5]{c,v,t}:
  13,14,"<h2>A Parable for the Weakness of the False Gods of the Polytheists</h2> `Ali bin Abi Talib said that Allah's statement, ﴾لَهُ دَعْوَةُ الْحَقِّ﴿ (For Him is the Word of Truth.) is in reference to Tawhid, according to Ibn Jarir At-Tabari. Ibn `Abbas, Qatadah, and Malik who narrated it from Muhammad bin Al-Munkadir, said that, ﴾لَهُ دَعْوَةُ الْحَقِّ﴿ (For Him is the Word of Truth.) means, \"La ilaha illallah.\" Allah said next, ﴾وَالَّذِينَ يَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِهِ﴿ (And those whom they invoke besides Him...), meaning, the example of those who worship others besides Allah, ﴾كَبَـسِطِ كَفَّيْهِ إِلَى الْمَآءِ لِيَبْلُغَ فَاهُ﴿ (like one who stretches forth his hand for water to reach his mouth,) `Ali bin Abi Talib commented, \"Like he who stretches his hand on the edge of a deep well to reach the water, even though his hands do not reach it; so how can the water reach his mouth\" Mujahid said about, ﴾كَبَـسِطِ كَفَّيْهِ﴿ (like one who stretches forth his hand) \"Calling the water with his words and pointing at it, but it will never come to him this way.\" The meaning of this Ayah is that he who stretches his hand to water from far away, to either collect some or draw some from far away, will not benefit from the water which will not reach his mouth, where water should be consumed. Likewise, those idolators who call another deity besides Allah, will never benefit from these deities in this life or the Hereafter, hence Allah's statement, ﴾وَمَا دُعَآءُ الْكَـفِرِينَ إِلاَّ فِى ضَلَـلٍ﴿ (and the invocation of the disbelievers is nothing but misguidance.) "
  13,15,"<h2>Everything prostrates unto Allah</h2> Allah affirms His might and power, for He has full control over everything, and everything is subservient to Him. Therefore, everything, including the believers, prostrate to Allah willingly, while the disbelievers do so unwillingly, ﴾وَظِلَـلُهُم بِالْغُدُوِّ﴿ (and so do their shadows in the mornings), in the beginning of the days, ﴾وَالاٌّصَالِ﴿ (and in the afternoons.) towards the end of the days. Allah said in another Ayah, ﴾أَوَ لَمْيَرَوْاْ إِلَىخَلَقَ اللَّهُ مِن شَىْءٍ يَتَفَيَّأُ﴿ (Have they not observed things that Allah has created: (how) their shadows incline.) 16:48 ﴾قُلْ مَن رَّبُّ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ قُلِ اللَّهُ قُلْ أَفَاتَّخَذْتُمْ مِّن دُونِهِ أَوْلِيَآءَ لاَ يَمْلِكُونَ لأَنْفُسِهِمْ نَفْعًا وَلاَ ضَرًّا قُلْ هَلْ يَسْتَوِى الاٌّعْمَى وَالْبَصِيرُ أَمْ هَلْ تَسْتَوِى الظُّلُمَـتُ وَالنُّورُ أَمْ جَعَلُواْ للَّهِ شُرَكَآءَ خَلَقُواْ كَخَلْقِهِ فَتَشَابَهَ الْخَلْقُ عَلَيْهِمْ قُلِ اللَّهُ خَـلِقُ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ وَهُوَ الْوَاحِدُ الْقَهَّـرُ ﴿"
  13,16,"<h2>Affirming Tawhid</h2> Allah affirms here that there is no deity worthy of worship except Him, since they admit that He alone created the heavens and the earth and that He is their Lord and the Disposer of all affairs. Yet, they take as lords others besides Allah and worship them, even though these false gods do not have the power to benefit or harm themselves, or those who worship them. Therefore, the polytheists will not benefit or have harm removed from them by these false deities. Are those who worship the false deities instead of Allah equal to those who worship Him alone, without partners, and thus have a light from their Lord This is why Allah said here, ﴾قُلْ هَلْ يَسْتَوِى الاٌّعْمَى وَالْبَصِيرُ أَمْ هَلْ تَسْتَوِى الظُّلُمَـتُ وَالنُّورُ أَمْ جَعَلُواْ للَّهِ شُرَكَآءَ خَلَقُواْ كَخَلْقِهِ فَتَشَابَهَ الْخَلْقُ عَلَيْهِمْ﴿ (Say: \"Is the blind equal to the one who sees Or darkness equal to light Or do they assign to Allah partners who created the like of His creation, so that the creations seemed alike to them\") Allah asks, `Do these polytheists worship gods besides Him that rival Him in what He created Have their false deities created similar creations to those Allah created and, thus, they are confused between the two types of creations, not knowing which was created by others besides Allah' Rather, the Ayah proves that the truth is nothing like this. There is none similar to Allah, nor does He have an equal, a rival, anyone like Him, a minister, a son, or a wife. Allah is glorified in that He is far away from all that is ascribed to Him. These idolators worship gods that they themselves admit were created by Allah and are subservient to Him. They used to say during their Talbiyah: \"Here we rush to Your obedience. There is no partner for You, except Your partner, You own him and he owns not.\" Allah also mentioned their polytheistic statements in other Ayat, ﴾مَا نَعْبُدُهُمْ إِلاَّ لِيُقَرِّبُونَآ إِلَى اللَّهِ زُلْفَى﴿ (We worship them only that they may bring us near to Allah.) 39:3 Allah admonished them for this false creed, stating that only those whom He chooses are allowed to intercede with Him, ﴾وَلاَ تَنفَعُ الشَّفَـعَةُ عِندَهُ إِلاَّ لِمَنْ أَذِنَ لَهُ﴿ (Intercession with Him profits not except for him whom He permits.) 34:23 ﴾وَكَمْ مِّن مَّلَكٍ فِى السَّمَـوَتِ﴿ (And there are many angels in the heavens.....)53:26, and, ﴾إِن كُلُّ مَن فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ إِلاَّ آتِى الرَّحْمَـنِ عَبْداً - لَّقَدْ أَحْصَـهُمْ وَعَدَّهُمْ عَدّاً - وَكُلُّهُمْ ءَاتِيهِ يَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ فَرْداً ﴿ (There is none in the heavens and the earth but comes unto the Most Gracious (Allah) as a servant. Verily, He knows each one of them, and has counted them a full counting. And everyone of them will come to Him alone on the Day of Resurrection.) 19:93-95 If all are Allah's servants, then why do any of them worships each other without proof or evidence that allows them to do so Rather, they rely on sheer opinion and innovation in the religion, even though Allah has sent all of His Prophets and Messengers, from beginning to end, prohibiting this practice (polytheism) and ordering them to refrain from worshipping others besides Allah. They defied their Messengers and rebelled against them, and this is why the word of punishment struck them as a worthy recompense, e ﴾وَلاَ يَظْلِمُ رَبُّكَ أَحَدًا﴿ (And your Lord treats no one with injustice) 18:49 "
  13,17,"<h2>Two Parables proving that Truth remains and Falsehood perishes</h2> This honorable Ayah contains two parables which affirm that truth remains and increases, while falsehood diminishes and perishes. Allah said,  أَنزَلَ مِنَ الْسَّمَآءِ مَآءً  (He sends down water from the sky,) He sends rain,  فَسَالَتْ أَوْدِيَةٌ بِقَدَرِهَا  (and the valleys flow according to their measure,) each valley taking its share according to its capacity, for some valleys are wider and can retain more water than others which are small and thus retain smaller measures of water. This Ayah indicates that hearts differ, for some of them can retain substantial knowledge while others cannot entertain knowledge, but rather are bothered by knowledge,  فَاحْتَمَلَ السَّيْلُ زَبَدًا رَّابِيًا  (but the flood bears away the foam that mounts up to the surface) of the water that ran down the valleys; this is the first parable. Allah said next,  وَمِمَّا يُوقِدُونَ عَلَيْهِ فِى النَّارِ ابْتِغَآءَ حِلْيَةٍ أَوْ مَتَـعٍ  (and (also) from that (ore) which they heat in the fire in order to make ornaments or utensils...) This is the second parable, whereas gold and silver ore is heated with fire to make adornments with it, and iron and copper ore are heated to make pots and the like with it. Foam also rises to the surface of these ores, just as in the case with water,  كَذَلِكَ يَضْرِبُ اللَّهُ الْحَقَّ وَالْبَـطِلَ  (thus does Allah (by parables) show forth truth and falsehood.) when they both exist, falsehood does not remain, just as foam does not remain with the water or the gold and silver ores which are heated in fire. Rather, foam dissipates and vanishes,  فَأَمَّا الزَّبَدُ فَيَذْهَبُ جُفَآءً  (Then, as for the foam it passes away as scum upon the banks,) for it carries no benefit and dissipates and scatters on the banks of the valley. The foam also sticks to trees or is dissipated by wind, just as the case with the scum that rises on the surface of gold, silver, iron and copper ores; it all goes away and never returns. However, water, gold and silver remain and are used to man's benefit. This is why Allah said next,  وَأَمَّا مَا يَنفَعُ النَّاسَ فَيَمْكُثُ فِى الاٌّرْضِ كَذلِكَ يَضْرِبُ اللَّهُ الاٌّمْثَالَ  (while that which is for the good of mankind remains in the earth. Thus Allah sets forth parables.) Allah said in a similar Ayah,  وَتِلْكَ الاٌّمْثَالُ نَضْرِبُهَا لِلنَّاسِ وَمَا يَعْقِلُهَآ إِلاَّ الْعَـلِمُونَ  (And these similitudes We put forward for mankind; but none will understand them except those who have knowledge.) 29:43 Some of the Salaf (rightly guided ancestors) said, \"When I would read a parable in the Qur'an that I could not comprehend, I would cry for myself because Allah the Exalted says,  وَمَا يَعْقِلُهَآ إِلاَّ الْعَـلِمُونَ  (But none will understand them except those who have knowledge.)\" 29:43 `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that `Abdullah bin `Abbas commented on Allah's statement,  أَنَزَلَ مِنَ السَّمَآءِ مَآءً فَسَالَتْ أَوْدِيَةٌ بِقَدَرِهَا  (He sends down water from the sky, and the valleys flow according to their measure,) \"This is a parable that Allah has set; the hearts carry knowledge from Him, and certainty according to the amount of doubt. As for doubt, working good deeds does not benefit while it exists. As for certainty, Allah benefits its people by it, hence Allah's statement,  فَأَمَّا الزَّبَدُ  (Then, as for the foam), which refers to doubt,  فَيَذْهَبُ جُفَآءً وَأَمَّا مَا يَنفَعُ النَّاسَ فَيَمْكُثُ فِى الاٌّرْضِ  (it passes away as scum upon the banks, while that which is for the good of mankind remains in the earth.) in reference to certainty. And just as when jewelry is heated in fire and is rid of its impurity, which remains in the fire, similarly Allah accepts certainty and discards doubt.\" <h2>The Qur'an and the Sunnah contain Parables that use Water and Fire</h2> Allah has set two examples in the beginning of Surat Al-Baqarah (chapter 2) about the hypocrites, one using fire and another using water. Allah said,  مَثَلُهُمْ كَمَثَلِ الَّذِى اسْتَوْقَدَ نَاراً فَلَمَّآ أَضَاءَتْ مَا حَوْلَهُ  (Their likeness is as the likeness of one who kindled a fire; then, when it illuminated all around him.) 2:17 then He said,  أَوْ كَصَيِّبٍ مِّنَ السَّمَآءِ فِيهِ ظُلُمَـتٌ وَرَعْدٌ وَبَرْقٌ  (Or like a rainstorm in the sky, bringing darkness, thunder, and lightning.) 2:19 Allah also has set two parables for the disbelievers in Surat An-Nur (chapter 24), one of them is,  وَالَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ أَعْمَـلُهُمْ كَسَرَابٍ  (As for those who disbelieved, their deeds are like a mirage in a desert.)24:39 The mirage occurs during intense heat. It is recorded in the Two Sahihs that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,  «فَيُقَالُ لِلْيَهُودِ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ: فَمَا تُرِيدُون؟ فَيَقُولُونَ: أَيْ رَبَّنَا عَطِشْنَا فَاسْقِنَا. فَيُقَالُ: أَلَا تَرِدُونَ؟ فَيَرِدُونَ النَّارَ فَإِذَا هِيَ كَسَرَابٍ يَحْطِمُ بَعْضُهَا بَعْضًا»  (It will be said to the Jews on the Day of Resurrection, \"What do you desire\" They will reply, \"We need to drink, for we have become thirsty, O our Lord!\" It will be said, \"Will you then proceed to drink,\" and they will head towards the Fire, which will appear as a mirage, its various parts consuming the other parts.\") Allah said in the second parable (in Surat An-Nur);  أَوْ كَظُلُمَـتٍ فِى بَحْرٍ لُّجِّىٍّ  (Or is like the darkness in a vast deep sea.)24:40 In the Two Sahihs it is recorded that Abu Musa Al-Ash`ari said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,  «إِنَّ مَثَلَ مَا بَعَثَنِي اللهُ بِهِ مِنَ الْهُدَى وَالْعِلْمِ، كَمَثَلِ غَيْثٍ أَصَابَ أَرْضًا، فَكَانَ مِنْهَا طَائِفَةٌ قَبِلَتِ الْمَاءَ فَأَنْبَتَتِ الْكَلَأَ وَالْعُشْبَ الْكَثِيرَ، وَكَانَتْ مِنْهَا أَجَادِبُ أَمْسَكَتِ الْمَاءَ، فَنَفَعَ اللهُ بِهَا النَّاسَ، فَشَرِبُوا، وَرَعَوْا، وَسَقُوا، وَزَرَعُوا، وَأَصَابَتْ طَائِفَةً مِنْهَا أُخْرَى، إِنَّمَااِهيَ قِيعَانٌ لَا تُمْسِكُ مَاءً وَلَا تُنْبِتُ كَلَأً، فَذَلِكَ مَثَلُ مَنْ فَقُهَ فِي دِينِ اللهِ وَنَفَعَهُ اللهُ بِمَا بَعَثَنِي وَنَفَعَ بِهِ، فَعَلِمَ وَعَلَّمَ، وَمَثَلُ مَنْ لَمْ يَرْفَعْ بِذَلِكَ رَأْسًا وَلَمْ يَقْبَلْ هُدَى اللهِ الَّذِي أُرْسِلْتُ بِه»  (The example of guidance and knowledge with which Allah has sent me is like abundant rain falling on the earth, some of which was fertile soil that absorbed the rain water and brought forth vegetation and grass in abundance. And another portion of it was hard, it held the rain water and Allah benefited the people with it and they utilized it for drinking, grazing, making their animals drink from it and for irrigation purposes. And another portion of it fell on barren land, which could neither hold the water nor bring forth vegetation. The first is the example of the person who comprehends Allah's religion and gets benefit, as well as benefiting others (from the knowledge and guidance) which Allah has revealed through me and learns and then teaches others. The last example is that of a person who does not care for it and does not embrace Allah's guidance revealed through me.) This parable uses water in it. In another Hadith that Imam Ahmad collected, Abu Hurayrah narrated that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ  said,  «مَثَلِي وَمَثَلُكُمْ كَمَثَلِ رَجُلٍ اسْتَوْقَدَ نَارًا فَلَمَّا أَضَاءَتْ مَا حَوْلَهُ، جَعَلَ الْفَرَاشُ وَهَذِهِ الدَّوَابُّ الَّتِي يَقَعْنَ فِي النَّارِ يَقَعْنَ فِيهَا، وَجَعَلَ يَحْجُزُهُنَّ وَيغْلِبْنَهُ فَيَقْتَحِمْنَ فِيهَا قَالَ : فَذَلِكُمْ مَثَلِي وَمَثَلُكُمْ، أَنَا آخِذٌ بِحُجَزِكُمْ عَنِ النَّارِ، هَلُمَّ عَنِ النَّارِ، فَتَغْلِبُونِي، فَتَقْتَحِمُونَ فِيهَا»  (My example and the example of you is like that of a person who lit a fire. When the fire illuminated his surroundings, butterflies and insects started falling into it, as they usually do, and he started swatting at them to prevent them from falling; but they overwhelmed him and kept falling into the fire. This is the parable of me and you, I am holding you by the waist trying to save you from the Fire, saying, \"Go away from the Fire,\" yet you overwhelm me and fall into it.) The Two Sahihs also collected this Hadith. This is a parable using fire. "
  13,18,"<h2>Reward of the Blessed and Wretched Ones</h2> Allah mentions the final destination of the blessed ones and the wretched ones,  لِلَّذِينَ اسْتَجَابُواْ لِرَبِّهِمُ  (For those who answered their Lord's call) obeyed Allah and followed His Messenger (Muhammad ﷺ) by obeying his commands and believing in the narrations he brought about the past and the future, theirs will be,  الْحُسْنَى  (Al-Husna), which is the good reward. Allah said that Dhul-Qarnayn declared,  قَالَ أَمَّا مَن ظَلَمَ فَسَوْفَ نُعَذِّبُهُ ثُمَّ يُرَدُّ إِلَى رَبِّهِ فَيُعَذِّبُهُ عَذَاباً نُّكْراً - وَأَمَّا مَنْ آمَنَ وَعَمِلَ صَـلِحاً فَلَهُ جَزَآءً الْحُسْنَى وَسَنَقُولُ لَهُ مِنْ أَمْرِنَا يُسْراً  (As for him who does wrong, we shall punish him, and then he will be brought back unto his Lord, Who will punish him with a terrible torment (Hell). But as for him who believes and works righteousness, he shall have the best reward (Al-Husna), and we shall speak unto him mild words by our command)18: 87-88 Allah said in another Ayah,  لِّلَّذِينَ أَحْسَنُواْ الْحُسْنَى وَزِيَادَةٌ  (For those who have done good is the best (Al-Husna) and even more.) 10: 26 Allah said next,  وَالَّذِينَ لَمْ يَسْتَجِيبُواْ لَهُ  (But those who answered not His call,) disobeyed Allah,  لَوْ أَنَّ لَهُمْ مَّا فِى الاٌّرْضِ جَمِيعاً  (if they had all that is in the earth together) meaning, in the Hereafter. This Ayah says: Had the earth's fill of gold and its like with it, they would try to ransom themselves from Allah's torment at that time. However, this will not be accepted from them. Verily, Allah the Exalted will not accept any type of exchange from,  أُوْلَـئِكَ لَهُمْ سُوءُ الْحِسَـبِ  (For them there will be the terrible reckoning.) in the Hereafter, when they will be reckoned for the Naqir and the Qitmir, the big and the small. Verily, he who is reckoned in detail on that Day will receive punishment, hence Allah's statement next,  وَمَأْوَاهُمْ جَهَنَّمُ وَبِئْسَ الْمِهَادُ  (Their dwelling place will be Hell; and worst indeed is that place for rest.)  أَفَمَن يَعْلَمُ أَنَّمَآ أُنزِلَ إِلَيْكَ مِن رَبِّكَ الْحَقُّ كَمَنْ هُوَ أَعْمَى إِنَّمَا يَتَذَكَّرُ أُوْلُواْ الأَلْبَـبِ "
