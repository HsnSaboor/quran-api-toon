  9,87,"<h2>Admonishing Those Who did not join the Jihad</h2> Allah chastises and admonishes those who stayed away from Jihad and refrained from performing it, even though they had the supplies, means and ability to join it. They asked the Messenger for permission to stay behind, saying,  ﴾ذَرْنَا نَكُنْ مَّعَ الْقَـعِدِينَ﴿ (\"Leave us (behind), we would be with those who sit (at home)\") thus accepting for themselves the shame of lagging behind with women, after the army had left. If war starts, such people are the most cowardice, but when it is safe, they are the most boastful among men. Allah described them in another Ayah,  ﴾فَإِذَا جَآءَ الْخَوْفُ رَأَيْتَهُمْ يَنظُرُونَ إِلَيْكَ تَدورُ أَعْيُنُهُمْ كَالَّذِى يُغْشَى عَلَيْهِ مِنَ الْمَوْتِ فَإِذَا ذَهَبَ الْخَوْفُ سَلَقُوكُم بِأَلْسِنَةٍ حِدَادٍ﴿ (Then when fear comes, you will see them looking to you, their eyes revolving like (those of) one over whom hovers death; but when the fear departs, they will smite you with sharp tongues.)33:19 their tongues direct their harsh words against you, when it is safe to do so. In battle, however, they are the most cowardice among men. Allah said in another Ayah,  ﴾وَيَقُولُ الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ لَوْلاَ نُزِّلَتْ سُورَةٌ فَإِذَآ أُنزِلَتْ سُورَةٌ مُّحْكَمَةٌ وَذُكِرَ فِيهَا الْقِتَالُ رَأَيْتَ الَّذِينَ فِى قُلُوبِهِمْ مَّرَضٌ يَنظُرُونَ إِلَيْكَ نَظَرَ الْمَغْشِىِّ عَلَيْهِ مِنَ الْمَوْتِ فَأَوْلَى لَهُمْ - طَاعَةٌ وَقَوْلٌ مَّعْرُوفٌ فَإِذَا عَزَمَ الاٌّمْرُ فَلَوْ صَدَقُواْ اللَّهَ لَكَانَ خَيْراً لَّهُمْ ﴿ (Those who believe say: \"Why is not a Surah sent down (for us) But when a decisive Surah (explaining and ordering things) is sent down, and fighting is mentioned therein, you will see those in whose hearts is a disease looking at you with a look of one fainting to death. But it was better for them. Obedience (to Allah) and good words (were better for them). And when the matter is resolved on, then if they had been true to Allah, it would have been better for them.) 47:20-21 sAllah said next,  ﴾وَطُبِعَ عَلَى قُلُوبِهِمْ﴿ (Their hearts are sealed up) because of their staying away from Jihad and from accompanying the Messenger in Allah's cause,  ﴾فَهُمْ لاَ يَفْقَهُونَ﴿ (so they understand not.) they neither understand what benefits them so that they perform it nor what hurts them so that they avoid it.  ﴾لَـكِنِ الرَّسُولُ وَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ مَعَهُ جَـهَدُواْ بِأَمْوَلِهِمْ وَأَنفُسِهِمْ وَأُوْلَـئِكَ لَهُمُ الْخَيْرَاتُ وَأُوْلَـئِكَ هُمُ الْمُفْلِحُونَ ﴿"

  9,89,"<h2>After Allah mentioned the sins of the hypocrites, He praised the faithful believers and described their reward in the Hereafter,</h2>﴾لَـكِنِ الرَّسُولُ وَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ مَعَهُ جَـهَدُواْ﴿ (But the Messenger and those who believed with him strove hard and fought) until the end of these two Ayat 9:88-89. This describes the qualities, as well as, the reward of faithful believers. Allah said,  ﴾وَأُوْلَـئِكَ لَهُمُ الْخَيْرَاتُ﴿ (Such are they for whom are the good things), in the Hereafter, in the gardens of Al-Firdaws and the high grades.  "
  9,90,"﴾وَقَعَدَ الَّذِينَ كَذَبُواْ اللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ﴿ (and those who had lied to Allah and His Messenger sat at home), and did not ask for permission for it; and Allah warned them of painful punishment,  ﴾سَيُصِيبُ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ مِنْهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ﴿ (a painful torment will seize those of them who disbelieve.)  "

  9,93,"<h2>Legitimate Excuses for staying away from Jihad</h2> Allah mentions here the valid excuses that permit one to stay away from fighting. He first mentions the excuses that remain with a person, the weakness in the body that disallows one from Jihad, such as blindness, limping, and so forth. He then mentions the excuses that are not permanent, such as an illness that would prevent one from fighting in the cause of Allah, or poverty that prevents preparing for Jihad. There is no sin in these cases if they remain behind, providing that when they remain behind, they do not spread malice or try to discourage Muslims from fighting, but all the while observing good behavior in this state, just as Allah said,  مَا عَلَى الْمُحْسِنِينَ مِن سَبِيلٍ وَاللَّهُ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ  (No means (of complaint) can there be against the doers of good. And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.) Al-Awza`i said, \"The people went out for the Istisqa' (rain) prayer. Bilal bin Sa`d stood up, praised Allah and thanked Him then said, `O those who are present! Do you concur that wrong has been done' They said, `Yes, by Allah!' He said, `O Allah! We hear your statement,  مَا عَلَى الْمُحْسِنِينَ مِن سَبِيلٍ  (No means (of complaint) can there be against the doers of good.) O Allah! We admit our errors, so forgive us and give us mercy and rain.' He then raised his hands and the people also raised their hands, and rain was sent down on them.\" Mujahid said about Allah's statement,  وَلاَ عَلَى الَّذِينَ إِذَا مَآ أَتَوْكَ لِتَحْمِلَهُمْ  (Nor (is there blame) on those who came to you to be provided with mounts) Mujahid said; \"It was revealed about Bani Muqarrin from the tribe of Muzaynah. \" Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Al-Hasan said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,  «لَقَدْ خَلَّفْتُمْ بِالْمَدِينَةِ أَقْوَامًا مَا أَنْفَقْتُمْ مِنْ نَفَقَةٍ وَلَا قَطَعْتُمْ وَادِيًا وَلَا نِلْتُمْ مِنْ عَدُوَ نَيْلًا إِلَّا وَقَدْ شَرَكُوكُمْ فِي الْأَجْر»  (Some people have remained behind you in Al-Madinah; and you never spent anything, crossed a valley, or afflicted hardship on an enemy, but they were sharing the reward with you.) He then recited the Ayah,  وَلاَ عَلَى الَّذِينَ إِذَا مَآ أَتَوْكَ لِتَحْمِلَهُمْ قُلْتَ لاَ أَجِدُ مَآ أَحْمِلُكُمْ عَلَيْهِ  (Nor (is there blame) on those who came to you to be provided with mounts, when you said: \"I can find no mounts for you.\") This Hadith has a basis in the Two Sahihs from Anas, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,  «إِنَّ بِالْمَدِينَةِ أَقْوَامًا مَا قَطَعْتُمْ وَادِيًا وَلَا سِرْتُمْ سَيْرًا إِلَّا وَهُمْ مَعَكُم»  (Some people have remained behind in Al-Madinah and you never crossed a valley or marched forth, but they were with you.) They said, \"While they are still at Al-Madinah\" He said,  «نَعَمْ حَبَسَهُمُ الْعُذْر»  (Yes, as they have been held back by a (legal) excuse.) Then, Allah criticized those who seek permission to remain behind while they are rich, admonishing them for wanting to stay behind with women who remained in their homes,  وَطَبَعَ اللَّهُ عَلَى قُلُوبِهِمْ فَهُمْ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ  (and Allah has sealed up their hearts, so that they know not (what they are losing).)
