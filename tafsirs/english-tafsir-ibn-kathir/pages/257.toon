  14,12,"<h2>The Argument between the Prophets and the Disbelievers</h2> Allah narrates to us the arguments that ensued between the disbelievers and their Messengers. When their nations doubted the Message of worshipping Allah alone without partners, the Messengers said, ﴾أَفِى اللَّهِ شَكٌّ﴿ ((What!) Can there be a doubt about Allah...) about His Lordship and having the exclusive right to be worshipped alone, being the only Creator of all creatures Verily, none besides Allah is worthy of worship, alone without partners with Him. Most nations were, and still are, affirming the existence of the Creator, but they call upon intermediaries besides Him whom they think will benefit them or bring them closer to Allah. Their Messengers said to them, ﴾يَدْعُوكُمْ لِيَغْفِرَ لَكُمْ مِّن ذُنُوبِكُمْ﴿ (He calls you that He may forgive you of your sins) in the Hereafter, ﴾وَيُؤَخِّرْكُمْ إِلَى أَجَلٍ مُّسَمًّى﴿ (and give you respite for a term appointed.), in this worldly life. Allah said in other Ayat, ﴾وَأَنِ اسْتَغْفِرُواْ رَبَّكُمْ ثُمَّ تُوبُواْ إِلَيْهِ يُمَتِّعْكُمْ مَّتَاعًا حَسَنًا إِلَى أَجَلٍ مُّسَمًّى وَيُؤْتِ كُلَّ ذِي فَضْلٍ فَضْلَهُ﴿ (Seek the forgiveness of your Lord, and turn to Him in repentance, that He may grant you good enjoyment, for a term appointed, and bestow His abounding grace to every owner of grace.) 10:3 However, their nations went on arguing against their prophethood, after they had to submit to the first evidence (that Allah Alone created everything). <h2>Disbelievers reject Prophethood because the Messengers were Humans!</h2> Their nations said, ﴾إِنْ أَنتُمْ إِلاَّ بَشَرٌ مِّثْلُنَا﴿ (You are no more than human beings like us!) so why should we follow you just because you say so, even though we did not witness a miracle by your hands, ﴾فَأْتُونَا بِسُلْطَـنٍ مُّبِينٍ﴿ (Then bring us a clear authority.), a miracle of our choice. ﴾قَالَتْ لَهُمْ رُسُلُهُمْ إِن نَّحْنُ إِلاَّ بَشَرٌ مِّثْلُكُمْ﴿ (Their Messengers said to them: \"We are no more than human beings like you...\") affirming that truly, they were only human being like their nations, ﴾وَلَـكِنَّ اللَّهَ يَمُنُّ عَلَى مَن يَشَآءُ مِنْ عِبَادِهِ﴿ (but Allah bestows His grace to whom He wills of His servants.), with prophethood and messengership which is His choice, ﴾وَمَا كَانَ لَنَآ أَن نَّأْتِيَكُمْ بِسُلْطَـنٍ﴿ (It is not ours to bring you an authority) according to your choice, ﴾إِلاَّ بِإِذْنِ اللَّهِ﴿ ((except by the permission of Allah. ), after we beg Him and He provides us with a miracle, ﴾وَعَلَى اللَّهِ فَلْيَتَوَكَّلِ الْمُؤْمِنُونَ﴿ (And in Allah (alone) let the believers put their trust.) in all their affairs. Their Messengers said to them next, ﴾وَمَا لَنَآ أَلاَّ نَتَوَكَّلَ عَلَى اللَّهِ﴿ (And why should we not put our trust in Allah), after He had guided us to the best, most clear and plain way, ﴾وَلَنَصْبِرَنَّ عَلَى مَآ آذَيْتُمُونَا﴿ (And we shall certainly bear with patience all the hurt you may cause us), such as foolish actions and abusive statements, ﴾وَعَلَى اللَّهِ فَلْيَتَوَكَّلِ الْمُتَوَكِّلُونَ﴿ (and in Allah (alone) let those who trust, put their trust.)

  14,17,"<h2>Disbelieving Nations threaten Their Messengers with Expulsion</h2> Allah narrates to us how the disbelieving nations threatened their Messengers, that being, expulsion from their land and banshiment. For instance, the people of Prophet Shu`ayb, peace be upon him, said to him and to those who believed in him,  لَنُخْرِجَنَّكَ يـشُعَيْبُ وَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ مَعَكَ مِن قَرْيَتِنَآ  (We shall certainly drive you out from our town, O Shu`ayb, and those who have believed with you.) 7:88 The people of Prophet Lut, peace be upon him, said,  أَخْرِجُواْ ءَالَ لُوطٍ مِّن قَرْيَتِكُمْ  (Drive out the family of Lut from your city.) 27:56 Allah said about the idolators of Quraysh,  وَإِن كَادُواْ لَيَسْتَفِزُّونَكَ مِنَ الاٌّرْضِ لِيُخْرِجُوكَ مِنْهَا وَإِذًا لاَّ يَلْبَثُونَ خِلَـفَكَ إِلاَّ قَلِيلاً  (And verily, they were about to frighten you so much as to drive you out from the land. But in that case they would not have stayed after you, except for a little while.)17:76 and,  وَإِذْ يَمْكُرُ بِكَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ لِيُثْبِتُوكَ أَوْ يَقْتُلُوكَ أَوْ يُخْرِجُوكَ وَيَمْكُرُونَ وَيَمْكُرُ اللَّهُ وَاللَّهُ خَيْرُ الْمَـكِرِينَ  (And when the disbelievers plotted against you to imprison you, or to kill you, or to expel you out; they were plotting and Allah too was plotting; and Allah is the Best of those who plot. ) 8:30 Allah gave victory and aid to His Messenger after he emigrated from Makkah and gathered followers, supporters, and soldiers around him, who fought in the cause of Allah, the Exalted. Allah kept granting His Messenger more dominance until He opened for him Makkah, which sought to expel him. Allah gave him dominance over it, even when his enemies from Makkah and the rest of the people of the earth disliked it. Soon after, people began embracing the religion of Allah in large crowds and in a very short time Allah's Word and religion became high over all other religions, from the eastern and western parts of the world. Hence Allah's statement,  فَأَوْحَى إِلَيْهِمْ رَبُّهُمْ لَنُهْلِكَنَّ الظَّـلِمِينَوَلَنُسْكِنَنَّـكُمُ الاٌّرْضَ مِن بَعْدِهِمْ  (So their Lord revealed to them: \"Truly, We shall destroy the wrongdoers. And indeed, We shall make you dwell in the land after them.\") 14:13,14 Allah said in other Ayat,  وَلَقَدْ سَبَقَتْ كَلِمَتُنَا لِعِبَادِنَا الْمُرْسَلِينَ - إِنَّهُمْ لَهُمُ الْمَنصُورُونَ - وَإِنَّ جُندَنَا لَهُمُ الْغَـلِبُونَ  (And, verily, Our Word has gone forth of old for Our servants, the Messengers, that they verily, would be made triumphant, and that Our hosts! They verily, would be the victors.) 37:171-173,  كَتَبَ اللَّهُ لاّغْلِبَنَّ أَنَاْ وَرُسُلِى إِنَّ اللَّهَ قَوِىٌّ عَزِيزٌ  (Allah has decreed: \"Verily, it is I and My Messengers who shall be the victorious. Verily, Allah is All-Powerful, All-Mighty.\")58:21  وَلَقَدْ كَتَبْنَا فِى الزَّبُورِ مِن بَعْدِ الذِّكْرِ  (And indeed We have written in Az-Zabur after Adh-Dhikr.) 21:05  قَالَ مُوسَى لِقَوْمِهِ اسْتَعِينُواْ بِاللَّهِ وَاصْبِرُواْ إِنَّ الأَرْضَ للَّهِ يُورِثُهَا مَن يَشَآءُ مِنْ عِبَادِهِ وَالْعَـقِبَةُ لِلْمُتَّقِينَ  (Musa said to his people: \"Seek help in Allah and be patient. Verily, the earth is Allah's. He gives it as a heritage to whom He wills of His servants: and the (blessed) end is for the those who have Taqwa.\")7:128 and,  وَأَوْرَثْنَا الْقَوْمَ الَّذِينَ كَانُواْ يُسْتَضْعَفُونَ مَشَـرِقَ الاٌّرْضِ وَمَغَـرِبَهَا الَّتِى بَارَكْنَا فِيهَا وَتَمَّتْ كَلِمَتُ رَبِّكَ الْحُسْنَى عَلَى بَنِى إِسْرءِيلَ بِمَا صَبَرُواْ وَدَمَّرْنَا مَا كَانَ يَصْنَعُ فِرْعَوْنُ وَقَوْمُهُ وَمَا كَانُواْ يَعْرِشُونَ  (And We made the people who were considered weak to inherit the eastern parts of the land and the western parts thereof which We have blessed. And the fair Word of your Lord was fulfilled for the Children of Israel, because of their endurance. And We destroyed completely all the great works and buildings which Fir`awn and his people erected.)7:137 Allah said next,  ذَلِكَ لِمَنْ خَافَ مَقَامِى وَخَافَ وَعِيدِ  (This is for him who fears standing before Me and also fears My threat. ) this warning is for he who fears standing before Him on the Day of Resurrection and fears His warnings and torment. Allah said in other instances,  فَأَمَّا مَن طَغَى - وَءاثَرَ الْحَيَوةَ الدُّنْيَا - فَإِنَّ الْجَحِيمَ هِىَ الْمَأْوَى وَأَمَّا مَنْ خَافَ مَقَامَ رَبِّهِ وَنَهَى النَّفْسَ عَنِفَإِنَّ الْجَنَّةَ هِىَ الْمَأْوَى  (Then for him who transgressed all bounds, and preferred the life of this world, verily, his abode will be Hellfire. But as for him who feared standing before his Lord, and restrained himself from impure evil desires and lusts. Verily, Paradise will be his abode.)79:37-41 and,  وَلِمَنْ خَافَ مَقَامَ رَبِّهِ جَنَّتَانِ  (But for him who fears the standing before his Lord, there will be two Gardens.)55:46 Allah said next,  وَاسْتَفْتَحُواْ  (And they sought victory and help) refers to the Messengers who sought the help and victory of their Lord over their nations, according to `Abdullah bin `Abbas, Mujahid and Qatadah. `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam said that this Ayah refers to the nations, invoking Allah's victory against themselves! Some idolators said,  اللَّهُمَّ إِن كَانَ هَـذَا هُوَ الْحَقَّ مِنْ عِندِكَ فَأَمْطِرْ عَلَيْنَا حِجَارَةً مِّنَ السَّمَآءِ أَوِ ائْتِنَا بِعَذَابٍ أَلِيمٍ  (O Allah ! If this (Qur'an) is indeed the truth (revealed) from You, then rain down stones on us from the sky or bring on us a painful torment.) 8:32 It is possible that both meanings are desired here, for the idolators (of Quraysh) invoked Allah against themselves on the day of Badr, and the Messenger of Allah ﷺ invoked Him for victory and support. Allah said to the idolators then,  إِن تَسْتَفْتِحُواْ فَقَدْ جَآءَكُمُ الْفَتْحُ وَإِن تَنتَهُواْ فَهُوَ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ  ((O disbelievers) if you ask for a judgment, now has the judgment come unto you; and if you cease (to do wrong), it will be better for you.) 8:19 Allah knows best. Allah said next,  وَخَابَ كُلُّ جَبَّارٍ عَنِيدٍ  (and every obstinate, arrogant dictator was brought to a complete loss and destruction.) those who were arrogant and rebelled against the truth. Allah said in other Ayat,  أَلْقِيَا فِى جَهَنَّمَ كُلَّ كَفَّارٍ عَنِيدٍ - مَّنَّـعٍ لِّلْخَيْرِ مُعْتَدٍ مُّرِيبٍ - الَّذِى جَعَلَ مَعَ اللَّهِ إِلَـهاً ءَاخَرَ فَأَلْقِيَـهُ فِى الْعَذَابِ الشَّدِيدِ  ((Allah will say to the angels): \"Both of you throw into Hell every stubborn disbeliever - hinderer of good, transgressor, doubter, who set up another deity with Allah. Then both of you cast him in the severe torment.\") 50:24-26 The Prophet said,  «إِنَّهُ يُؤْتَى بِجَهَنَّمَ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ، فَتُنَادِي الْخَلَائِقَ، فَتَقُولُ: إِنِّي وُكِّلْتُ بِكُلِّ جَبَّارٍ عَنِيد»  (On the Day of Resurrection, Jahannam (Hellfire) will be brought and it will call the creatures, saying, \"I was given the responsibility of every rebellious tyrant.\") Therefore, every tyrant has earned utter demise and loss when the Prophets invoked Allah, the Mighty, the Able for victory. Allah said next,  مِّن وَرَآئِهِ جَهَنَّمُ  (In front of him is Hell,) Allah says that Jahannam is in front of every obstinate tyrant, awaiting him, and he will reside in it forever on the Day of Return. He will be brought to it in the morning and the afternoon until the Day of the Call,  وَيُسْقَى مِن مَّآءٍ صَدِيدٍ  (and he will be made to drink boiling, festering water.) in the Fire, his only drink will be from Hamim and Ghassaq, the former is very hot and the latter is very cold and rotten. Allah said in another instance,  هَـذَا فَلْيَذُوقُوهُ حَمِيمٌ وَغَسَّاقٌ - وَءَاخَرُ مِن شَكْلِهِ أَزْوَجٌ  (This is so! Then let them taste it - Hamim and Ghassaq. And other (torments) of similar kind all together!)38:57-58 Mujahid and `Ikrimah said that this festering water is made of puss and blood. Allah said in other Ayat,  وَسُقُواْ مَآءً حَمِيماً فَقَطَّعَ أَمْعَآءَهُمْ  (And be given to drink boiling water so that it cuts up their bowels. ) 47:15 and,  وَإِن يَسْتَغِيثُواْ يُغَاثُواْ بِمَآءٍ كَالْمُهْلِ يَشْوِى الْوجُوهَ  (And if they ask for help, they will be granted water like boiling oil, that will scald their faces.) 18:29 Allah's statement,  يَتَجَرَّعُهُ  (He will sip it unwillingly), indicates that he will hate to drink this water, but he will be forced to sip it; he will refuse until the angel strikes him with an iron bar,  وَلَهُمْ مَّقَامِعُ مِنْ حَدِيدٍ  (And for them are hooked rods of iron.)22:21 Allah said next,  وَلاَ يَكَادُ يُسِيغُهُ  (and he will find great difficulty in swallowing it down his throat,) meaning, he will hate to swallow it because of its awful taste, color and unbearable heat or coldness,  وَيَأْتِيهِ الْمَوْتُ مِن كُلِّ مَكَانٍ  (and death will come to him from every side,) his organs, limbs and entire body will suffer pain because of this drink. `Amr bin Maymun bin Mahran commented, \"Every bone, nerve and blood vessel.\" Ad-Dahhak reported that Ibn `Abbas commented on Allah's statement,  وَيَأْتِيهِ الْمَوْتُ مِن كُلِّ مَكَانٍ  (and death will come to him from every side,) \"All types of torment that Allah will punish him with on the Day of Resurrection in the fire of Jahannam will come to him carrying death, if he were to die. However, he will not die because Allah the Exalted said,  لاَ يُقْضَى عَلَيْهِمْ فَيَمُوتُواْ وَلاَ يُخَفَّفُ عَنْهُمْ مِّنْ عَذَابِهَا  (Neither will it affect them that they die nor shall its torment be lightened for them)35:36.\" Therefore, according to Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him and his father, every type of punishment will come to him (the obstinate, rebellious tyrant) carrying death with it, if he will ever die there. Yet, he will not die, he will instead receive eternal punishment and torment. Hence Allah's statement here,  وَيَأْتِيهِ الْمَوْتُ مِن كُلِّ مَكَانٍ وَمَا هُوَ بِمَيِّتٍ  (and death will come to him from every side, yet he will not die,) Allah said,  وَمِن وَرَآئِهِ عَذَابٌ غَلِيظٌ  (and in front of him, will be a great torment.) even in this condition, he will still suffer another severe type of torment, more severe and painful from the one before it, harsher more bitter. Allah described the tree of Zaqqum,  إِنَّهَا شَجَرَةٌ تَخْرُجُ فِى أَصْلِ الْجَحِيمِ - طَلْعُهَا كَأَنَّهُ رُءُوسُ الشَّيَـطِينِ - فَإِنَّهُمْ لاّكِلُونَ مِنْهَا فَمَالِئُونَ مِنْهَا الْبُطُونَ - ثُمَّ إِنَّ لَهُمْ عَلَيْهَا لَشَوْباً مِنْ حَمِيمٍ - ثُمَّ إِنَّ مَرْجِعَهُمْ لإِلَى الْجَحِيمِ  (Verily, it is a tree that springs out of the bottom of Hellfire, the shoots of its fruits stalks are like the heads of Shayatin; Truly, they will eat thereof and fill their bellies therewith. Then on top of that they will be given boiling water to drink so that it becomes a mixture. Then thereafter, verily, their return is to the flaming fire of Hell.)37:64-68 Allah states that they will either be eating from the Zaqqum, drinking the Hamim, or being tormented in the Fire, again and again; we seek refuge with Allah from all of this. Allah also said,  هَـذِهِ جَهَنَّمُ الَّتِى يُكَذِّبُ بِهَا الْمُجْرِمُونَ - يَطُوفُونَ بَيْنَهَا وَبَيْنَ حَمِيمٍ ءَانٍ  (This is the Hell which the criminals denied. They will go between it (Hell) and the fierce boiling water!)55:43-44,  إِنَّ شَجَرَةَ الزَّقُّومِ - طَعَامُ الاٌّثِيمِ - كَالْمُهْلِ يَغْلِى فِى الْبُطُونِ - كَغَلْىِ الْحَمِيمِ - خُذُوهُ فَاعْتِلُوهُ إِلَى سَوَآءِ الْجَحِيمِ - ثُمَّ صُبُّواْ فَوْقَ رَأْسِهِ مِنْ عَذَابِ الْحَمِيمِ - ذُقْ إِنَّكَ أَنتَ الْعَزِيزُ الْكَرِيمُ - إِنَّ هَـذَا مَا كُنتُمْ بِهِ تَمْتَرُونَ  (Verily, the tree of Zaqqum will be the food of the sinners. Like boiling oil, it will boil in the bellies, like the boiling of scalding water. (It will be said) \"Seize him and drag him into the midst of blazing Fire, then pour over his head the torment of boiling water. Taste you (this)! Verily, you were the mighty, the generous! Verily, this is that whereof you used to doubt!\")44:43-50,  وَأَصْحَـبُ الشِّمَالِ مَآ أَصْحَـبُ الشِّمَالِ - فِى سَمُومٍ وَحَمِيمٍ - وَظِلٍّ مِّن يَحْمُومٍ - لاَّ بَارِدٍ وَلاَ كَرِيمٍ  (And those on the Left Hand - how (unfortunate) will be those on the Left Hand In fierce hot wind and boiling water, and shadow of black smoke, neither cool nor pleasant.)56:41-44  هَـذَا وَإِنَّ لِلطَّـغِينَ لَشَرَّ مَـَابٍ - جَهَنَّمَ يَصْلَوْنَهَا فَبِئْسَ الْمِهَادُ - هَـذَا فَلْيَذُوقُوهُ حَمِيمٌ وَغَسَّاقٌ - وَءَاخَرُ مِن شَكْلِهِ أَزْوَجٌ  (This is so! And for the Taghun will be an evil final return. Hell! Where they will burn, and worst is that place to rest! This is so! Then let them taste it Hamim and Ghassaq. And other (torments) of similar kind all together!)38:55-58 There are many other similar Ayat that indicate that the punishment they will receive is of different kinds, and that it is repeated in various types and forms that only Allah the Exalted knows, as just recompense,  وَمَا رَبُّكَ بِظَلَّـمٍ لِّلْعَبِيدِ  (And your Lord is not at all unjust to (His) slaves.) 41:46 "
  14,18,"<h2>A Parable for the Deeds of the Disbelievers</h2> This is a parable that Allah has given for the deeds and actions of the disbelievers who worshipped others besides Him and rejected His Messengers, thus building their acts on groundless basis. Their actions vanished from them when they were most in need of their rewards. Allah said, ﴾مَّثَلُ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ بِرَبِّهِمْ أَعْمَالُهُمْ﴿ (The parable of those who disbelieved in their Lord is that their works) on the Day of Judgment, when they will seek their rewards from Allah the Exalted. They used to think that they had something, but they will find nothing, except what remains of ashes when a strong wind blows on it, ﴾فِي يَوْمٍ عَاصِفٍ﴿ (on a stormy day;) They will not earn rewards for any of the good works they performed during this life, except what they can preserve of ashes during a day of strong wind. Allah said in other Ayat, ﴾وَقَدِمْنَآ إِلَى مَا عَمِلُواْ مِنْ عَمَلٍ فَجَعَلْنَاهُ هَبَآءً مَّنثُوراً ﴿ (And We shall turn to whatever deeds they did, and We shall make such deeds as scattered floating particles of dust.)25:23, ﴾مَثَلُ مَا يُنْفِقُونَ فِى هِـذِهِ الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا كَمَثَلِ رِيحٍ فِيهَا صِرٌّ أَصَابَتْ حَرْثَ قَوْمٍ ظَلَمُواْ أَنفُسَهُمْ فَأَهْلَكَتْهُ وَمَا ظَلَمَهُمُ اللَّهُ وَلَـكِنْ أَنفُسَهُمْ يَظْلِمُونَ ﴿ (The parable of what they spend in this world is that of a wind which is extremely cold; it struck the harvest of a people who did wrong against themselves and destroyed it. Allah wronged them not, but they wronged themselves.)3:117,and, ﴾يأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ لاَ تُبْطِلُواْ صَدَقَـتِكُم بِالْمَنِّ وَالاٌّذَى كَالَّذِى يُنفِقُ مَالَهُ رِئَآءَ النَّاسِ وَلاَ يُؤْمِنُ بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الاٌّخِرِ فَمَثَلُهُ كَمَثَلِ صَفْوَانٍ عَلَيْهِ تُرَابٌ فَأَصَابَهُ وَابِلٌ فَتَرَكَهُ صَلْدًا لاَّ يَقْدِرُونَ عَلَى شَىْءٍ مِّمَّا كَسَبُواْ وَاللَّهُ لاَ يَهْدِي الْقَوْمَ الْكَـفِرِينَ ﴿ (O you who believe! Do not render in vain your Sadaqah (charity) by reminders of your generosity or by injury, like him who spends his wealth to be seen of men, and he does not believe in Allah, nor in the Last Day. His parable is that of a smooth rock on which is a little dust; on it falls heavy rain which leaves it bare. They are not able to do anything with what they have earned. And Allah does not guide the disbelieving people.)2:264 Allah said in this Ayah, ﴾ذلِكَ هُوَ الضَّلاَلُ الْبَعِيدُ﴿ (That is the straying, far away from the right path) meaning, their work and deeds were not based on firm, correct grounds, and thus, they lost their rewards when they needed them the most, ﴾ذلِكَ هُوَ الضَّلاَلُ الْبَعِيدُ﴿ (That is the straying, far away from the right path.) "
