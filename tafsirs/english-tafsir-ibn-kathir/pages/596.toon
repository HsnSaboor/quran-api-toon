  92,21,"<h2>The Matter of Guidance and other than it is in the Hand of Allah, and Allah's Warning about the Hell</h2> Qatadah said,  إِنَّ عَلَيْنَا لَلْهُدَى  (Truly, on Us is (to give) guidance.) \"This means, We will explain what is lawful and what is prohibited.\" Others have said that it means, \"Whoever traverses upon the path of guidance, then he will reach Allah (i.e., in the Hereafter).\" They consider this Ayah like Allah's saying,  وَعَلَى اللَّهِ قَصْدُ السَّبِيلِ  (And upon Allah is the responsibility to explain the Straight path.) (16:9) This has been mentioned by Ibn Jarir. Allah said;  وَإِنَّ لَنَا لَلاٌّخِرَةَ وَالاٍّولَى  (And truly, unto Us (belong) the last (Hereafter) and the first (this world).) This means, `they both belong to Us and I (Allah) am in complete control of them.' Then Allah says,  فَأَنذَرْتُكُمْ نَاراً تَلَظَّى  (Therefore I have warned you of a Fire Talazza.) Mujahid said, \"Blazing.\" Imam Ahmad recorded from Simak bin Harb that he heard An-Nu`man bin Bashir giving a sermon, in which he said, \"I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ giving a sermon, in which he said:  «أَنْذَرْتُكُمُ النَّار»  (I have warned you of the Fire.) And he said it in such a voice that if a man was in the marketplace he could hear it from where I am standing now. And he said it (with such force) that the garment that was on his shoulder fell down to his feet.\" Imam Ahmad recorded from Abu Ishaq that he heard An-Nu`man bin Bashir giving a sermon, in which he said, \"I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ saying,  «إِنَّ أَهْوَنَ أَهْلِ النَّارِ عَذَابًا يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ رَجُلٌ تُوضَعُ فِي أَخْمَصِ قَدَمَيْهِ جَمْرَتَانِ يَغْلِي مِنْهُمَا دِمَاغُه»  (Verily, the person to be punished lightest of the people of the Fire on the Day of Judgement will be a man who will have placed on the soles of his feet two coals that will cause his brain to boil.)\" Imam Al-Bukhari also recorded this narration. Muslim recorded that Abu Ishaq narrated from An-Nu`man bin Bashir that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,  «إِنَّ أَهْوَنَ أَهْلِ النَّارِ عَذَابًا مَنْ لَهُ نَعْلَانِ وَشِرَاكَانِ مِنْ نَارٍ يَغْلِي مِنْهُمَا دِمَاغُهُ كَمَا يَغْلِي الْمِرْجَلُ، مَا يَرَى أَنَّ أَحَدًا أَشَدُّ مِنْهُ عَذَابًا، وَإِنَّهُ لَأَهْوَنُهُمْ عَذَابًا»  (Verily, the lightest punishment received by the people of the Hellfire will be a man who will have two sandals whose straps will be made of fire that will cause his brain to boil just as a cauldron boils. Yet he will not think that anyone is receiving a torment more severe than him, even though he will be receiving the lightest punishment of them.) Allah says,  لاَ يَصْلَـهَآ إِلاَّ الاٌّشْقَى  (None shall enter it save the most wretched.) meaning, none will enter surrounded by it on all sides except the most wretched. Then Allah explains who this (the most wretched) is by His saying,  الَّذِى كَذَّبَ  (Who denies) meaning, in his heart.  وَتَوَلَّى  (and turns away.) meaning, from acting with his limbs and performing deeds according to their pillars. Imam Ahmad recorded from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,  «كُلُّ أُمَّتِي يَدْخُلُ الْجَنَّـةَ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ إِلَّا مَنْ أَبَى»  (All of my followers will enter Paradise on the Day of Judgement except for whoever refuses.) They (the Companions) said, \"Who would refuse, O Messenger of Allah\" He replied,  «مَنْ أَطَاعَنِي دَخَلَ الْجَنَّةَ، وَمَنْ عَصَانِي فَقَدْ أَبَى»  (Whoever obeys me, he will enter Paradise, and whoever disobeys me, then he has refused.) Al-Bukhari also recorded this Hadith. Allah then says,  وَسَيُجَنَّبُهَا الاٌّتْقَى  (And those with Taqwa will be far removed from it.) meaning, the righteous, pure, most pious person will be saved from the Fire. Then He explains who he is by His saying,  الَّذِى يُؤْتِى مَالَهُ يَتَزَكَّى  (He who gives of his wealth for self-purification.) meaning, he spends his wealth in obedience of his Lord in order to purify himself, his wealth and whatever Allah has bestowed upon him of religion and worldly things.  وَمَا لاًّحَدٍ عِندَهُ مِن نِّعْمَةٍ تُجْزَى  (And who has (in mind) no favor from anyone to be paid back.) meaning, giving his wealth is not done so that he may gain some favor from someone wherein they return some good to him, and therefore he gives to get something in return. He only spends his wealth  ابْتِغَآءَ وَجْهِ رَبِّهِ الاٌّعْلَى  (to seek the Face of his Lord, the Most High) meaning, hoping to attain the blessing of seeing Him in the final abode in the Gardens of Paradise. Allah then says,  وَلَسَوْفَ يَرْضَى  (He, surely, will be pleased.) meaning, indeed those with these characteristics will be pleased. <h2>The Cause of this Revelation and the Virtue of Abu Bakr</h2> Many of the scholars of Tafsir have mentioned that these Ayat were revealed about Abu Bakr As-Siddiq. Some of them even mentioned that there is a consensus among the Qur'anic commentators concerning this. There is no doubt that he is included in the meaning of these Ayat, and that he is the most deserving of the Ummah to be described with these characteristics in general, for indeed, the wording of these Ayat is general. As in Allah's saying,  وَسَيُجَنَّبُهَا الاٌّتْقَى - الَّذِى يُؤْتِى مَالَهُ يَتَزَكَّى - وَمَا لاًّحَدٍ عِندَهُ مِن نِّعْمَةٍ تُجْزَى  (And those with Taqwa will be far removed from it. He who gives of his wealth for self-purification. And who has (in mind) no favor from anyone to be paid back.) However, he (Abu Bakr) was the first and foremost of this Ummah to have all of these characteristics and other praiseworthy characteristics as well. For verily, he was truthful, pious, generous, charitable, and he always spent his wealth in obedience of His Master (Allah) and in aiding the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. How many Dirhams and Dinars did he spend seeking the Face of His Most Noble Lord. And did not consider any of the people as owning him some favor that he needed to get compensation for. Rather, his virtue and kindness was even shown towards leaders and chiefs from all the other tribes as well. This is why `Urwah bin Mas`ud, who was the chief of the Thaqif tribe, said to him on the day of the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah, \"By Allah, if I did not owe you a debt, which I have not paid you back for, I would have responded to you (i.e., your call to Islam).\" Abu Bakr As-Siddiq became angry with him for saying such a thing (i.e., I owe you something). So if this was his position with the chiefs of the Arabs and the heads of the tribes, then what about those other than them. Thus, Allah says,  وَمَا لاًّحَدٍ عِندَهُ مِن نِّعْمَةٍ تُجْزَى - إِلاَّ ابْتِغَآءَ وَجْهِ رَبِّهِ الاٌّعْلَى - وَلَسَوْفَ يَرْضَى  (And who has (in mind) no favor from anyone to be paid back. Except to seek the Face of his Lord, the Most High. He, surely, will be pleased.) And in the Two Sahihs it is recorded that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,  «مَنْ أَنْفَقَ زَوْجَيْنِ فِي سَبِيلِ اللهِ دَعَتْهُ خَزَنَةُ الْجَنَّةِ يَاعَبْدَاللهِ، هَذَا خَيْر»  (Whoever equipped two riding animals in the way of Allah, the Gatekeepers of Paradise will call to him saying, \"O servant of Allah! This is good.\") So Abu Bakr said, \"O Messenger of Allah! The one who is called from them will not have any need. Will there be anyone who will be called from all of them\" The Prophet replied,  «نَعَمْ ، وَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونَ مِنْهُم»  (Yes, and I hope that you will be one of them.) This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat Al-Layl, and all praise and thanks are due to Allah. "

  93,11,"<h2>Which was revealed in Makkah</h2>﴾بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ ﴿ (In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. <h2>The Reason for the Revelation of Surat Ad-Duha</h2> Imam Ahmad recorded from Jundub that he said, \"The Prophet became ill, so he did not stand for prayer for a night or two. Then a woman came and said, `O Muhammad! I think that your devil has finally left you.' So Allah revealed, ﴾وَالضُّحَى - وَالَّيْلِ إِذَا سَجَى - مَا وَدَّعَكَ رَبُّكَ وَمَا قَلَى ﴿ (By the forenoon. By the night when it darkens. Your Lord has neither forsaken you nor hates you.)\" Al-Bukhari, Muslim, At-Tirmidhi, An-Nasa'i, Ibn Abi Hatim and Ibn Jarir, all recorded this Hadith. This Jundub (who narrated it) is Ibn `Abdullah Al-Bajali Al-`Alaqi. In a narration from Al-Aswad bin Qays, he said that he heard Jundub say that Jibril was slow in coming to the Messenger of Allah . So the idolators said, \"Muhammad's Lord has abandoned him.\" So Allah revealed, ﴾وَالضُّحَى - وَالَّيْلِ إِذَا سَجَى - مَا وَدَّعَكَ رَبُّكَ وَمَا قَلَى ﴿ (By the forenoon. By the night when it darkens. Your Lord has neither forsaken you nor hates you.) ﴾وَالضُّحَى - وَالَّيْلِ إِذَا سَجَى ﴿ (By the forenoon. By the night when it darkens.) Al-`Awfi reported from Ibn `Abbas, \"When the Qur'an was revealed to the Messenger of Allah , Jibril was delayed from coming to him for a number of days (on one occasion). Therefore, the Messenger of Allah was affected by this. Then the idolators began to say, `His Lord has abandoned him and hates him.' So Allah revealed, ﴾مَا وَدَّعَكَ رَبُّكَ وَمَا قَلَى ﴿ (Your Lord has neither forsaken you nor hates you.)\" In this, Allah is swearing by the forenoon and the light that He has placed in it. ﴾وَالَّيْلِ إِذَا سَجَى ﴿ (By the night when it darkens (Saja).) meaning, it settles, darkens meaning, it settles, darkens and overcomes them. This was said by Mujahid, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak, Ibn Zayd and others. This is a clear proof of the power of the Creator of this (light) and that (darkness). This is as Allah says, ﴾وَالَّيْلِ إِذَا يَغْشَى - وَالنَّهَارِ إِذَا تَجَلَّى ﴿ (By the night as it envelops. By the Day as it appears.) (92:1-2) Allah also says, ﴾فَالِقُ الإِصْبَاحِ وَجَعَلَ الَّيْلَ سَكَناً وَالشَّمْسَ وَالْقَمَرَ حُسْبَاناً ذَلِكَ تَقْدِيرُ الْعَزِيزِ الْعَلِيمِ ﴿ ((He is the) Cleaver of the daybreak. He has appointed the night for resting, and the sun and the moon for reckoning. Such is the measuring of the Almighty, the All-Knowing.) (6:96) Allah then says, ﴾مَا وَدَّعَكَ رَبُّكَ﴿ (Your Lord has neither forsaken you) meaning, `He has not abandoned you.' ﴾وَمَا قَلَى﴿ (nor hates (Qala) you.) meaning, `He does not hate you.' <h2>The Hereafter is Better Than This First Life</h2>﴾وَلَلاٌّخِرَةُ خَيْرٌ لَّكَ مِنَ الاٍّولَى ﴿ (And indeed the Hereafter is better for you than the present.) meaning, the abode of the Hereafter is better for you than this current abode. For this reason the Messenger of Allah used to be the most abstinent of the people concerning the worldly things, and he was the greatest of them in his disregard for worldly matters. This is well known by necessity from his biography. When the Prophet was given the choice at the end of his life between remaining in this life forever and then going to Paradise, or moving on to the company of Allah, he chose that which is with Allah over this lowly world. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"The Messenger of Allah was lying down on a straw mat and it left marks on his side. Then when he woke up he began to rub his side. So I said, `O Messenger of Allah! Will you allow us to spread something soft over this straw mat' He replied, ﴾«مَالِي وَلِلدُّنْيَا، إِنَّمَا مَثَلِي وَمَثَلُ الدُّنْيَا كَرَاكِبٍ ظَلَّ تَحْتَ شَجَرَةٍ ثُمَّ رَاحَ وَتَرَكَهَا»﴿ (I have nothing to do with this world. The parable of me and this world is like a rider who rests in the shade of a tree, then he passes on and leaves it.)\" At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah both recorded this Hadith by way of Al-Mas`udi. At-Tirmidhi said, \"Hasan Sahih.\" <h2>The Numerous Bounties of the Hereafter are waiting for the Messenger of Allah</h2> Then Allah says, ﴾وَلَسَوْفَ يُعْطِيكَ رَبُّكَ فَتَرْضَى ﴿ (And verily, your Lord will give you so that you shall be well-pleased.) meaning, in the final abode Allah will give him until He pleases him concerning his followers, and in that which He has prepared for him from His generosity. From this will be the River of Al-Kawthar, which will have domes of hollowed pearls on its banks, and the mud on its banks will be the strongest frangrance of musk, as will be mentioned. Imam Abu `Amr Al-Awza`i recorded that Ibn `Abbas said, \"The Messenger of Allah was shown that which his Ummah would be blessed with after him, treasure upon treasure. So he was pleased with that. Then Allah revealed, ﴾وَلَسَوْفَ يُعْطِيكَ رَبُّكَ فَتَرْضَى ﴿ (And verily, your Lord will give you so that you shall be well-pleased.) So, Allah will give him in Paradise one million palaces, and each palace will contain whatever he wishes of wives and servants.\" This was recorded by Ibn Jarir and Ibn Abi Hatim from his route of transmission. This chain of narration is authentic to Ibn `Abbas, and statements like this can only be said from that which is Tawqif. <h2>The Numerous Bounties of the Hereafter are waiting for the Messenger of Allah</h2> Then Allah says, ﴾وَلَسَوْفَ يُعْطِيكَ رَبُّكَ فَتَرْضَى ﴿ (And verily, your Lord will give you so that you shall be well-pleased.) meaning, in the final abode Allah will give him until He pleases him concerning his followers, and in that which He has prepared for him from His generosity. From this will be the River of Al-Kawthar, which will have domes of hollowed pearls on its banks, and the mud on its banks will be the strongest frangrance of musk, as will be mentioned.

This chain of narration is authentic to Ibn `Abbas, and statements like this can only be said from that which is Tawqif. <h2>A Mention of some of Allah's Favors upon the Messenger Enumerating His favors upon His Messenger</h2> Allah says; ﴾أَلَمْ يَجِدْكَ يَتِيماً فَآوَى ﴿ (Did He not find you an orphan and gave you a refuge) This refers to the fact that his father died while his mother was still pregnant with him, and his mother, Aminah bint Wahb died when he was only six years old. After this he was under the guardianship of his grandfather, `Abdul-Muttalib, until he died when Muhammad was eight years old. Then his uncle, Abu Talib took responsibility for him and continued to protect him, assist him, elavate his status, honor him, and even restrain his people from harming him when he was forty years of age and Allah commissioned him with the prophethood. Even with this, Abu Talib continued to follow the religion of his people, worshipping idols. All of this took place by the divine decree of Allah and His decree is most excellent. Until Abu Talib died a short time before the Hijrah. After this (Abu Talib's death) the foolish and ignorant people of the Quraysh began to attack him, so Allah chose for him to migrate away from them to the city of Al-Aws and Al-Khazraj among those who helped him (in Al-Madinah). Allah caused his Sunnah to be spread in the most perfect and complete manner. Then, when he arrived at their city, they gave him shelter, supported him, defended him and fought before him (against the enemies of Islam) -- may Allah be pleased with all of them. All of this was from Allah's protection for him, guarding over him and caring for him. Then Allah says, ﴾وَوَجَدَكَ ضَآلاًّ فَهَدَى ﴿ (He found you unaware and guided you) This is similar to Allah's saying, ﴾وَكَذَلِكَ أَوْحَيْنَآ إِلَيْكَ رُوحاً مِّنْ أَمْرِنَا مَا كُنتَ تَدْرِى مَا الْكِتَـبُ وَلاَ الإِيمَـنُ وَلَـكِن جَعَلْنَـهُ نُوراً نَّهْدِى بِهِ مَن نَّشَآءُ مِنْ عِبَادِنَا﴿ (And thus We have sent to you a Ruh from Our command. you knew not what is the Book, nor what is Faith. But We have made it a light wherewith We guide whosoever of our servants We will...) (42:52) Allah says, ﴾وَوَجَدَكَ عَآئِلاً فَأَغْنَى ﴿ (And He found you poor and made you rich) meaning, `you were poor having dependents, so Allah made you wealthy and independent of all others besides Him.' Thus, Allah combined for him the two positions: the one who is poor and patient, and the one who is wealthy and thankful. In the Two Sahihs it has been recorded from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah said, ﴾«لَيْسَ الْغِنَى عَنْ كَثْرَةِ الْعَرَضِ، وَلَكِنَّ الْغِنَى غِنَى النَّفْس»﴿ (Wealth is not determined by abundance of possessions, but wealth is the richness of the soul.) In Sahih Muslim, it is recorded from `Abdullah bin `Amr that the Messenger of Allah said, ﴾«قَدْ أَفْلَحَ مَنْ أَسْلَمَ وَرُزِقَ كَفَافًا وَقَنَّعَهُ اللهُ بِمَا آتَاه»﴿ (Whoever accepts Islam, is provided with his basic needs, and Allah makes him content with what He has given him, then he will be successful.) <h2>How should this Bounty be responded to</h2> Then Allah says, ﴾فَأَمَّا الْيَتِيمَ فَلاَ تَقْهَرْ ﴿ (Therefore, treat not the orphan with oppression.) meaning, `just as you were an orphan and Allah sheltered you, then do not oppress the orphan.' In other words, `do not humiliate him, scorn him or despise him. Rather, you should be kind and gentle to him.' Qatadah said, \"Be like a merciful father to the orphan.\" ﴾وَأَمَّا السَّآئِلَ فَلاَ تَنْهَرْ ﴿ (And repulse not the one who asks.) meaning, `just as you were astray and Allah guided you, then do not scorn the one who asks for knowledge seeking to be guided.' Ibn Ishaq said, ﴾وَأَمَّا السَّآئِلَ فَلاَ تَنْهَرْ ﴿ (And repulse not the one who asks.) \"This means do not be oppressive, arrogant, wicked, or mean to the weak among Allah's servants.\" Qatadah said, \"This means respond to the poor with mercy and gentleness.\" ﴾وَأَمَّا بِنِعْمَةِ رَبِّكَ فَحَدِّثْ ﴿ (And procalim the grace of your Lord.) meaning, `just as you were poor and needy, and Allah made you wealthy, then tell about Allah's favor upon you.' Abu Dawud recorded from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet said, ﴾«لَا يَشْكُرُ اللهَ مَنْ لَا يَشْكُرُ النَّاس»﴿ (Whoever is not thankful to the people, then he is not thankful to Allah.) At-Tirmidhi also recorded this Hadith and he said, \"Sahih\". Abu Dawud recorded from Jabir that the Prophet said, ﴾«مَنْ أُبْلِيَ بَلَاءً فَذَكَرَهُ فَقَدْ شَكَرَهُ، وَمَنْ كَتَمَهُ فَقَدْ كَفَرَه»﴿ (Whoever overcomes some test (i.e., calamity) and mentions it (to others), then he is indeed thankful. And whoever conceals it, then indeed he was ungrateful.) Abu Dawud was alone in recording this Hadith. This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat Ad-Duha, and unto Allah is due all praise and thanks. "

  94,8,"<h2>Which was revealed in Makkah</h2> بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ  In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. <h2>The Meaning of opening the Breast</h2> Allah says,  أَلَمْ نَشْرَحْ لَكَ صَدْرَكَ  (Have We not opened your breast for you) meaning, `have We not opened your chest for you.' This means, `We illuminated it, and We made it spacious, vast and wide.' This is as Allah says,  فَمَن يُرِدِ اللَّهُ أَن يَهْدِيَهُ يَشْرَحْ صَدْرَهُ لِلإِسْلَـمِ  (And whomsoever Allah wills to guide, He opens his breast to Islam.) (6:125) And just as Allah expanded his chest, He also made His Law vast, wide, accommodating and easy, containing no difficulty, hardship or burden. <h2>A Discussion of Allah's Favor upon His Messenger Concerning Allah's statement,</h2> وَوَضَعْنَا عَنكَ وِزْرَكَ  (And removed from you your burden.) This means  لِّيَغْفِرَ لَكَ اللَّهُ مَا تَقَدَّمَ مِن ذَنبِكَ وَمَا تَأَخَّرَ  (That Allah may forgive you your sins of the past and the future.) (48:2)  الَّذِى أَنقَضَ ظَهْرَكَ  (Which weighed down your back) Al-Inqad means the sound. And more than one of the Salaf has said concerning Allah's saying,  الَّذِى أَنقَضَ ظَهْرَكَ  (Which weighed down your back) meaning, `its burden weighed heavy upon you.' <h2>The Meaning of raising the Fame of the Prophet (Peace be upon him)</h2> وَرَفَعۡنَا لَكَ ذِكۡرَكَ  (And have We not raised high your fame?) Mujahid said, \"I (Allah) am not remembered except that you are remembered with Me: I bear witness that there is no God worthy of worship except Allah, and that Muhammad ﷺ is the Messenger of Allah.\"  Qatadah said , \"Allah raised his fame in this life and in the Hereafter. There is no one who gives a sermon, declares the Testimony of Faith (Shahadah), or prays a prayer (Salah) except that he proclaims it: I bear witness that there is no God worthy of worship except Allah, and that Muhammad ﷺ is the Messenger of Allah. <h2>Ease after Difficulty</h2> إِنَّ مَعَ ٱلۡعُسۡرِ يُسۡرً۬ا • فَإِنَّ مَعَ ٱلۡعُسۡرِ يُسۡرًا  (Verily along with every hardship is relief. Veriliy along with every hardship is relief)  Allah informs that with difficulty there is ease, and then He reaffirms this information (by repeating it) <h2>The Command to remember Allah during Spare Time</h2> فَإِذَا فَرَغۡتَ فَٱنصَبۡ • وَإِلَىٰ رَبِّكَ فَٱرۡغَب  ( So when you have finished, devote yourself to Allah's worship. And to your Lord turn intentions and hopes. )  Meaning, 'when you have completed your worldly affairs and its tasks, and you have broken away from its routine, then get up to perform the worship, and stand for it with zeal, complete devotion and purify your intention and desire for your lord.' Similar to this is the Prophet's statement in a hadith that is agreed-upon to be authentic,  لَا صَلَاةَ بِحَضْرَةِ الطَّعَامِ, وَلَا هُوَ يُدَافِعُهُ الأَخْبَثَانِ  There is no prayer when the food is served, nor when the two foul things (excrement and urine) are pressing a person.  The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) also said,  إِذَا أُقِيمَتِ الصَّلَاةُ وَحَضَرَ الْعَشَاءُ فَبْدَأُوا بِااْلْعَشَاءِ  When the prayer has started and the dinner has been served, then begin with dinner.  Mujahid said concerning this Ayah, \"When you are free from the worldly affairs, and you have stood to pray, then stand up for your Lord.\" "
