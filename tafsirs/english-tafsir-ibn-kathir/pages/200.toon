  9,80,"<h2>The Prohibition of asking for Forgiveness for Hypocrites</h2> Allah says to His Prophet that hypocrites are not worthy of seeking forgiveness for them and that if he asks Allah to forgive them seventy times, Allah will not forgive them. The number seventy here was mentioned to close the door on this subject, for Arabs use this number when they exaggerate, not that they actually mean seventy or more than seventy. Ash-Sha`bi said that when `Abdullah bin Ubayy was dying, his son went to the Prophet and said to him, \"My father has died, I wish you could attend him and pray the funeral prayer for him.\" The Prophet said,  ﴾«مَا اسْمُك»﴿ (\"What is you name) He said, \"Al-Hubab bin `Abdullah.\" The Prophet said,  ﴾«بَلْ أَنْتَ عَبْدُاللهِ بْنُ عَبْدِاللهِ إِنَّ الْحُبَابَ اسْمَ شَيْطَان»﴿ (Rather, you are `Abdullah bin `Abdullah, for Al-Hubab is a devil's name.) The Prophet went along with him, attended his father's funeral, gave him his shirt as a shroud and prayed the funeral prayer for him. He was asked, \"Would you pray on him, when he is a hypocrite\" He said,  ﴾«إِنَّ اللهَ قَالَ:﴿﴾إِن تَسْتَغْفِرْ لَهُمْ سَبْعِينَ مَرَّةً﴿﴾وَلَأسْتَغْفِرَنَّ لَهُمْ سَبْعِينَ وَسَبْعِينَ وَسَبْعِين»﴿ (Allah said,(...(and even) if you ask seventy times for their forgiveness...) Verily, I will ask Allah to forgive them seventy times and seventy more and seventy more.)\" Similar narrations were collected from `Urwah bin Az-Zubayr, Mujahid, Qatadah bin Di`amah and Ibn Jarir.

  9,82,"<h2>Hypocrites rejoice because They remained behind from Tabuk!</h2> Allah admonishes the hypocrites who lagged behind from the battle of Tabuk with the Companions of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, rejoicing that they remained behind after the Messenger ﷺ departed for the battle,  وَكَرِهُواْ أَن يُجَـهِدُواْ  (they hated to strive and fight), along with the Messenger ,  بِأَمْوَلِهِمْ وَأَنْفُسِهِمْ فِى سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ وَقَالُواْ  (with their properties and their lives in the cause of Allah, and they said), to each other,  لاَ تَنفِرُواْ فِى الْحَرِّ  (\"March not forth in the heat.\") Tabuk occurred at a time when the heat was intense and the fruits and shades became delightful. This is why they said,  لاَ تَنفِرُواْ فِى الْحَرِّ  (\"March not forth in the heat\") Allah said to His Messenger ,  قُلْ  (Say) to them,  نَارُ جَهَنَّمَ  (\"The fire of Hell...), which will be your destination because of your disobedience,  أَشَدُّ حَرًّا  (\". ..is more intense in heat;\"), than the heat that you sought to avoid; it is even more intense than fire. Imam Malik narrated that Abu Az-Zinad said that Al-A`raj narrated that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said,  «نَارُ بَنِي آدَمَ الَّتِي تُوقِدُونَهَا جُزْءٌ مِنْ سَبْعِينَ جُزْءًا مِنْ نَارِ جَهَنَّم»  (The fire that the son of Adam kindles is but one part of seventy parts of the Fire of Jahannam.) They said, \"O Allah's Messenger! This fire alone is enough.\" He said,  «فُضِّلَتْ عَلَيْهَا بِتِسْعَةٍ وَسِتِّينَ جُزْءًا»  ((Hellfire) was favored by sixty-nine parts.) The Two Sahihs collected this Hadith. Al-A`mash narrated that Abu Ishaq said that An-Nu`man bin Bashir said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,  «إِنَّ أَهْوَنَ أَهْلِ النَّارِ عَذَابًا يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ لِمَنْ لَهُ نَعْلَانِ وَشِرَاكَانِ مِنْ نَارِ جَهَنَّمَ يَغْلِي مِنْهُمَا دِمَاغُهُ كَمَا يَغْلِي الْمِرْجَلُ، لَا يَرَى أَنَّ أَحَدًا مِنْ أَهْلِ النَّارِ أَشَدُّ عَذَابًا مِنْهُ وَإِنَّهُ أَهْوَنُهُمْ عَذَابًا»  (On the Day of Resurrection, the person who will receive the least punishment among the people of the Fire, wears two slippers made from the Fire of Jahannam causing his brain to boil, just as a pot boils. He thinks that none in the Fire is receiving a more severe torment than he, when in fact he is receiving the least torment.) The Two Sahihs collected this Hadith. There are many other Ayat and Prophetic Hadiths on this subject. Allah said in His Glorious Book,  كَلاَّ إِنَّهَا لَظَى - نَزَّاعَةً لِّلشَّوَى  (By no means! Verily, it will be the Fire of Hell. Taking away (burning completely) the scalp!) 70:15-16,  هَـذَانِ خَصْمَانِ اخْتَصَمُواْ فِى رَبِّهِمْ فَالَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ قُطِّعَتْ لَهُمْ ثِيَابٌ مِّن نَّارِ يُصَبُّ مِن فَوْقِ رُءُوسِهِمُ الْحَمِيمُ - يُصْهَرُ بِهِ مَا فِى بُطُونِهِمْ وَالْجُلُودُ - وَلَهُمْ مَّقَامِعُ مِنْ حَدِيدٍ - كُلَّمَآ أَرَادُواْ أَن يَخْرُجُواْ مِنْهَا مِنْ غَمٍّ أُعِيدُواْ فِيهَا وَذُوقُواْ عَذَابَ الْحَرِيقِ  (Al-Hamim (boiling water) will be poured down over their heads. With it will melt (or vanish away) what is within their bellies, as well as (their) skins. And for them are hooked rods of iron (to punish them). Every time they seek to get away therefrom, from anguish, they will be driven back therein, and (it will be said to them): \"Taste the torment of burning!\") 22:19-22, and,  إِنَّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ بِـَايَـتِنَا سَوْفَ نُصْلِيهِمْ نَاراً كُلَّمَا نَضِجَتْ جُلُودُهُمْ بَدَّلْنَـهُمْ جُلُوداً غَيْرَهَا لِيَذُوقُواْ الْعَذَابَ  (Surely, those who disbelieved in Our Ayat, We shall burn them in Fire. As often as their skins are roasted through, We shall change them for other skins that they may taste the punishment.)4:56 Allah said here,  قُلْ نَارُ جَهَنَّمَ أَشَدُّ حَرًّا لَّوْ كَانُوا يَفْقَهُونَ  (Say: \"The fire of Hell is more intense in heat;\" if only they could understand!) meaning, if they have any comprehension or understanding, they would have marched with the Messenger of Allah ﷺ during the heat, so as to save themselves from the Fire of Jahannam, which is much more severe. Allah, the Exalted, then warns the hypocrites against their conduct,  فَلْيَضْحَكُواْ قَلِيلاً  (So let them laugh a little...) Ibn Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas commented, \"Life is short, so let them laugh as much as they like in it. But when life ends and they are returned to Allah, the Exalted and Most Honored, they will start crying forever without end.\" "
  9,83,"<h2>Hypocrites are barred from participating in Jihad</h2> Allah commands His Messenger, peace be upon him,  ﴾فَإِن رَّجَعَكَ اللَّهُ﴿ (If Allah brings you back), from this battle,  ﴾إِلَى طَآئِفَةٍ مِّنْهُمْ﴿ (to a party of them) in reference to the twelve (hypocrite) men, according to Qatadah,  ﴾فَاسْتَأْذَنُوكَ لِلْخُرُوجِ﴿ (and they ask your permission to go out), with you to another battle,  ﴾فَقُلْ لَّن تَخْرُجُواْ مَعِىَ أَبَدًا وَلَن تُقَـتِلُواْ مَعِىَ عَدُوًّا﴿ (say: \"Never shall you go out with me nor fight an enemy with me...\") as an admonishment and punishment for them. Allah mentioned the reason for this decision,  ﴾إِنَّكُمْ رَضِيتُمْ بِالْقُعُودِ أَوَّلَ مَرَّةٍ﴿ (\"You were pleased to sit (inactive) on the first occasion...\") Allah said in a similar Ayah,  ﴾وَنُقَلِّبُ أَفْئِدَتَهُمْ وَأَبْصَـرَهُمْ كَمَا لَمْ يُؤْمِنُواْ بِهِ أَوَّلَ مَرَّةٍ﴿ (And We shall turn their hearts and their eyes away (from guidance), as they refused to believe therein for the first time. ) 6:110 The recompense of an evil deed includes being directed to follow it with another evil deed, while the reward of a good deed includes being directed to another good deed after it. For instance, Allah said concerning the `Umrah of Hudaybiyyah,  ﴾سَيَقُولُ الْمُخَلَّفُونَ إِذَا انطَلَقْتُمْ إِلَى مَغَانِمَ لِتَأْخُذُوهَا﴿ (Those who lagged behind will say, when you set forth to take the spoils.)48:15 Allah said next,  ﴾فَاقْعُدُواْ مَعَ الْخَـلِفِينَ﴿ (\"...then you sit (now) with those who lag behind.\") in reference to the men who lagged behind from Tabuk battle, according to Ibn `Abbas.

  9,85,"<h2>The Prohibition of Prayer for the Funeral of Hypocrites</h2> Allah commands His Messenger to disown the hypocrites, to abstain from praying the funeral prayer when any of them dies, from standing next to his grave to seek Allah's forgiveness for him, or to invoke Allah for his benefit. This is because hypocrites disbelieved in Allah and His Messenger and died as such. This ruling applies to all those who are known to be hypocrites, even though it was revealed about the specific case of `Abdullah bin Ubayy bin Salul, the chief hypocrite. Al-Bukhari recorded that Ibn `Umar said, \"When `Abdullah bin Ubayy died, his son, `Abdullah bin `Abdullah, came to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and asked him to give him his shirt to shroud his father in, and the Messenger did that. He also asked that the Prophet offer his father's funeral prayer, and Allah's Messenger ﷺ stood up to offer the funeral prayer. `Umar took hold of the Prophet's robe and said, `O Allah's Messenger! Are you going to offer his funeral prayer even though your Lord has forbidden you to do so' Allah's Messenger ﷺ said,  «إِنَّمَا خَيَّرَنِي اللهُ فَقَالَ:  (I have been given the choice, for Allah says:  اسْتَغْفِرْ لَهُمْ أَوْ لاَ تَسْتَغْفِرْ لَهُمْ إِن تَسْتَغْفِرْ لَهُمْ سَبْعِينَ مَرَّةً فَلَن يَغْفِرَ اللَّهُ لَهُمْ  (Whether you ask forgiveness for them (hypocrites), or do not ask for forgiveness for them. Even though you ask for their forgiveness seventy times, Allah will not forgive them.)  وَسَأَزِيدُهُ عَلَى السَّبْعِين»  (Verily, I will ask for forgiveness for him more than seventy times).' `Umar said, `He is a hypocrite!' So Allah's Messenger offered the funeral prayer and on that Allah revealed this Verse,  وَلاَ تُصَلِّ عَلَى أَحَدٍ مِّنْهُم مَّاتَ أَبَداً وَلاَ تَقُمْ عَلَى قَبْرِهِ  (And never (O Muhammad) pray (funeral prayer) for any of them (hypocrites) who dies, nor stand at his grave.)\" `Umar bin Al-Khattab narrated a similar narration. In this narration, `Umar said, \"The Prophet offered his funeral prayer, walked with the funeral procession and stood on his grave until he was buried. I was amazed at my daring to talk like this to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, while Allah and His Messenger have better knowledge. By Allah, soon afterwards, these two Ayat were revealed,  وَلاَ تُصَلِّ عَلَى أَحَدٍ مِّنْهُم مَّاتَ أَبَداً  (And never (O Muhammad ) pray (funeral prayer) for any of them (hypocrites) who dies.) Ever since this revelation came, the Prophet never offered the funeral prayer for any hypocrite nor stood on his grave until Allah, the Exalted and Most Honored, brought death to him.\" At-Tirmidhi collected this Hadith in his Tafsir section of his Sunan and said, \"Hasan Sahih\". Al-Bukhari also recorded it. "
