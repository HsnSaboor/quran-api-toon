tafsir[5]{c,v,t}:
  2,260,"<h2>The Khalil Supplicates to Allah to Show Him How He Resurrects the Dead</h2> The scholars said that there are reasons behind this request by Ibrahim. For instance, when Ibrahim said to Nimrod,  رَبِّيَ الَّذِى يُحْىِ وَيُمِيتُ  e(My Lord (Allah) is He Who gives life and causes death,) he wanted to solidify his knowledge about resurrection by actually witnessing it with his eyes. Prophet Ibrahim said,  رَبِّ أَرِنِى كَيْفَ تُحْىِ الْمَوْتَى قَالَ أَوَلَمْ تُؤْمِن قَالَ بَلَى وَلَـكِن لِّيَطْمَئِنَّ قَلْبِى  (\"My Lord! Show me how You give life to the dead.\" He (Allah) said: \"Do you not believe\" He (Ibrahim) said: \"Yes (I believe), but to be stronger in faith.\")  Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,  «نَحْنُ أَحَقُّ بِالشَّكِّ مِنْ إِبْرَاهِيمَ إِذْ قَالَ  رَبِّ أَرِنِى كَيْفَ تُحْىِ الْمَوْتَى قَالَ أَوَلَمْ تُؤْمِن قَالَ بَلَى وَلَـكِن لِّيَطْمَئِنَّ قَلْبِى  (We are more liable to be in doubt than Ibrahim when he said, \"My Lord! Show me how You give life to the dead.\" Allah said, \"Don't you believe\" Ibrahim said, \"Yes (I believe), but (I ask) in order to be stronger in faith.\")  The Prophet's statement in the Hadith means, \"We are more liable to seek certainty.\" <h2>The Answer to Al-Khalil's Request</h2> Allah said,  قَالَ فَخُذْ أَرْبَعَةً مِّنَ الطَّيْرِ فَصُرْهُنَّ إِلَيْكَ  (He said: \"Take four birds, then cause them to incline towards you.\")  Scholars of Tafsir disagreed over the type of birds mentioned here, although this matter in not relevant due to the fact that the Qur'an did not mention it. Allah's statement,  فَصُرْهُنَّ إِلَيْكَ  (cause them to incline towards you) means, cut them to pieces. This is the explanation of Ibn `Abbas, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Abu Malik, Abu Al-Aswad Ad-Dili, Wahb bin Munabbih, Al-Hasan and As-Suddi. Therefore, Ibrahim caught four birds, slaughtered them, removed the feathers, tore the birds to pieces and mixed the pieces together. He then placed parts of these mixed pieces on four or seven hills. Ibn `Abbas said, \"Ibrahim kept the heads of these birds in his hand. Next, Allah commanded Ibrahim to call the birds to him, and he did as Allah commanded him. Ibrahim witnessed the feathers, blood and flesh of these birds fly to each other, and the parts flew each to their bodies, until every bird came back to life and came walking at a fast pace towards Ibrahim, so that the example that Ibrahim was witnessing would become more impressive. Each bird came to collect its head from Ibrahim's hand, and if he gave the bird another head the bird refused to accept it. When Ibrahim gave each bird its own head, the head was placed on its body by Allah's leave and power. \" This is why Allah said,  وَاعْلَمْ أَنَّ اللَّهَ عَزِيزٌ حَكِيمٌ  (And know that Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise) and no one can overwhelm or resist Him. Whatever Allah wills, occurs without hindrance, because He is the All-Mighty, Supreme above all things, and He is Wise in His statements, actions, legislation and decrees.  `Abdur-Razzaq recorded that Ma`mar said that Ayyub said that Ibn `Abbas commented on what Ibrahim said,  وَلَـكِن لِّيَطْمَئِنَّ قَلْبِى  (but to be stronger in Faith), \"To me, there is no Ayah in the Qur'an that brings more hope than this Ayah.\" Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Muhammad bin Al-Munkadir said that `Abdullah bin `Abbas met `Abdullah bin `Amr bin Al-`As and said to him, \"Which Ayah in the Qur'an carries more hope for you\" Ibn `Amr said,  قُلْ يعِبَادِىَ الَّذِينَ أَسْرَفُواْ عَلَى أَنفُسِهِمْ لاَ تَقْنَطُواْ  (Say: \"O `Ibadi (My servants) who have transgressed against themselves (by committing evil deeds and sins)! Despair not.) 39:53.  Ibn `Abbas said, \"But I say that it is Allah's statement,  وَإِذْ قَالَ إِبْرَهِيمُ رَبِّ أَرِنِى كَيْفَ تُحْىِ الْمَوْتَى قَالَ أَوَلَمْ تُؤْمِن قَالَ بَلَى  (And (remember) when Ibrahim said, \"My Lord! Show me how You give life to the dead.\" He (Allah) said: \"Do you not believe\" He (Ibrahim) said: \"Yes (I believe)...)  Allah accepted Ibrahim's affirmation when he merely said, `Yes.' This Ayah refers to the doubts that attack the heart and the thoughts that Shaytan inspires.\" Al-Hakim also recorded this in Al-Mustadrak and said; \"Its chain is Sahih but they did not record it.\" "
  2,261,"<h2>Rewards of Spending in Allah's Cause</h2> This is a parable that Allah made of the multiplication of rewards for those who spend in His cause, seeking His pleasure. Allah multiplies the good deed ten to seven hundred times. Allah said,  مَّثَلُ الَّذِينَ يُنفِقُونَ أَمْوَلَهُمْ فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ  (The parable of those who spend their wealth in the way of Allah...)  Sa`id bin Jubayr commented, \"Meaning spending in Allah's obedience.\" Makhul said that the Ayah means, \"Spending on Jihad, on horse stalls, weapons and so forth.\" The parable in the Ayah is more impressive on the heart than merely mentioning the number seven hundred. This Ayah indicates that Allah `grows' the good deeds for its doers, just as He grows the plant for whoever sows it in fertile land. The Sunnah also mentions that the deeds are multiplied up to seven hundred folds. For instance, Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Mas`ud said that a man once gave away a camel, with its bridle on, in the cause of Allah and the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,  «لَتَأْتِيَنَّ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ بِسَبْعِمِائَةِ نَاقَةٍ مَخْطُومَة»  (On the Day of Resurrection, you will have seven hundred camels with their bridles.)  Muslim and An-Nasa'i also recorded this Hadith, and Muslim's narration reads, \"A man brought a camel with its bridle on and said, `O Messenger of Allah! This is in the sake of Allah.' The Messenger ﷺ said,  «لَكَ بِهَا يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ سَبْعُمِائَةِ نَاقَة»  (You will earn seven hundred camels as reward for it on the Day of Resurrection. )  Another Hadith: Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,  «كُلُّ عَمَلِ ابْنِ آدَمَ يُضَاعَفُ، الْحَسَنَةُ بِعَشَرِ أَمْثَالِهَا، إِلَى سَبْعِمِائَةِ ضِعْفٍ، إِلى مَا شَاءَ اللهُ، يَقُولُ اللهُ: إِلَّا الصَّوْمَ فَإِنَّهُ لِي، وَأَنَا أَجْزِي بِهِ، يَدَعُ طَعَامَهُ وَشَهْوَتَهُ مِنْ أَجْلِي، وَلِلصَّائِمِ فَرْحَتَانِ: فَرْحَةٌ عِنْدَ فِطْرِهِ وَفَرْحَةٌ عِنْدَ لِقَاءِ رَبِّهِ، وَلَخَلُوفُ فَمِ الصَّائِمِ أَطْيَبُ عِنْدَ اللهِ مِنْ رِيحِ الْمِسْكِ، الصَّوْمُ جُنَّةٌ، الصَّومُ جُنَّة»  (Every good deed that the son of Adam performs will be multiplied ten folds, to seven hundred folds, to many other folds, to as much as Allah wills. Allah said, \"Except the fast, for it is for Me and I will reward for it. One abandons his food and desire in My sake.\" The fasting person has two times of happiness: when he breaks his fast and when he meets his Lord. Verily, the odor that comes from the mouth of whoever fasts is more pure to Allah than the scent of musk. Fasting is a shield (against sinning), fasting is a shield.) Muslim recorded this Hadith.  Allah's statement,  وَاللَّهُ يُضَـعِفُ لِمَن يَشَآءُ  (Allah gives manifold increase to whom He wills) is according to the person's sincerity in his deeds.  وَاللَّهُ وَسِعٌ عَلِيمٌ  (And Allah is All-Sufficient for His creatures' needs, All-Knower) meaning, His Favor is so wide that it encompasses much more than His creation, and He has full knowledge in whoever deserves it, or does not deserve it. All the praise and thanks are due to Allah. "

  2,264,"<h2>To Remind About Charity Given is Forbidden</h2> Allah praises those who spend from their money in His cause, and then refrain from reminding those who received the charity of that fact, whether these hints take the form of words or actions.  Allah's statement,  وَلاَ أَذًى  (or with injury), indicates that they do not cause harm to those whom they gave the charity to, for this harm will only annul the charity. Allah next promised them the best rewards for this good deed,  لَهُمْ أَجْرُهُمْ عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ  (their reward is with their Lord), indicating that Allah Himself will reward them for these righteous actions. Further,  وَلاَ خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ  (On them shall be no fear) regarding the horrors of the Day of Resurrection,  وَلاَ هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ  (nor shall they grieve) regarding the offspring that they leave behind and the adornment and delights of this world. They will not feel sorry for this, because they will acquire what is far better for them.  Allah then said,  قَوْلٌ مَّعْرُوفٌ  (Kind words) meaning, compassionate words and a supplication for Muslims,  وَمَغْفِرَةٌ  (and forgiving) meaning, forgiving an injustice that took the form of actions or words,  خَيْرٌ مِّن صَدَقَةٍ يَتْبَعُهَآ أَذًى  (are better than Sadaqah (charity) followed by injury.)  وَاللَّهُ غَنِىٌّ  (And Allah is Rich) not needing His creation,  حَلِيمٌ  (Most Forbearing) forgives, releases and pardons them.  There are several Hadiths that prohibit reminding people of acts of charity. For instance, Muslim recorded that Abu Dharr said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,  «ثَلَاثَةٌ لَا يُكَلِّمُهُمُ اللهُ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ، وَلَا يَنْظُرُ إِلَيْهِم، وَلَا يُزَكِّيهِمْ، وَلَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ: الْمَنَّانُ بِمَا أَعْطَى، وَالْمُسْبِلُ إِزَارَهُ، وَالْمُنَفِّقُ سِلْعَتَهُ بِالْحَلِفِ الْكَاذِب»  (Three persons whom Allah shall neither speak to on the Day of Resurrection nor look at nor purify, and they shall receive a painful torment: he who reminds (the people) of what he gives away, he who lengthens his clothes below the ankles and he who swears an oath while lying, to sell his merchandise.)  This is why Allah said,  يأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ لاَ تُبْطِلُواْ صَدَقَـتِكُم بِالْمَنِّ وَالاٌّذَى  (O you who believe! Do not render in vain your Sadaqah (charity) by reminders of your generosity or by injury) stating that the charity will be rendered in vain if it is followed by harm or reminders. In this case, the reward of giving away charity is not sufficient enough to nullify the harm and reminders. Allah then said,  كَالَّذِى يُنفِقُ مَالَهُ رِئَآءَ النَّاسِ  (like him who spends his wealth to be seen of men) meaning, \"Do not nullify your acts of charity by following them with reminders and harm, just like the charity of those who give it to show off to people.\" The boasting person pretends to give away charity for Allah's sake, but in reality seeks to gain people's praise and the reputation of being kind or generous, or other material gains of this life. All the while, he does not think about Allah or gaining His pleasure and generous rewards, and this is why Allah said,  وَلاَ يُؤْمِنُ بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الاٌّخِرِ  (and he does not believe in Allah, nor in the Last Day.)  Allah next set the example of whoever gives charity to show off. Ad-Dahhak commented that the example fits one who follows his acts of charity with reminders or harm. Allah said,  فَمَثَلُهُ كَمَثَلِ صَفْوَانٍ  (His likeness is the likeness of Safwan) where Safwan, from is Safwanah, meaning `the smooth rocks,'  عَلَيْهِ تُرَابٌ فَأَصَابَهُ وَابِلٌ  (on which is little dust; on it falls a Wabil) meaning, heavy rain,  فَتَرَكَهُ صَلْدًا  (which leaves it bare.) This Ayah means that heavy rain left the Safwan completely barren of dust. Such is the case with Allah's action regarding the work of those who show off, as their deeds are bound to vanish and disappear, even though people think that these deeds are as plentiful as specks of dust. So Allah said,  لاَّ يَقْدِرُونَ عَلَى شَىْءٍ مِّمَّا كَسَبُواْ وَاللَّهُ لاَ يَهْدِي الْقَوْمَ الْكَـفِرِينَ  (They are not able to do anything with what they have earned. And Allah does not guide the disbelieving people.) "
