  12,88,"<h2>Ya`qub orders His Children to inquire about Yusuf and His Brother</h2> Allah states that Ya`qub, peace be upon him, ordered his children to go back and inquire about the news of Yusuf and his brother Binyamin, in a good manner, not as spies. He encouraged them, delivered to them the good news and ordered them not to despair of Allah's mercy. He ordered them to never give up hope in Allah, nor to ever discontinue trusting in Him for what they seek to accomplish. He said to them that only the disbelieving people despair of Allah's mercy.  <h2>Yusuf's Brothers stand before Him</h2> Allah said next,  ﴾فَلَمَّا دَخَلُواْ عَلَيْهِ﴿ (Then, when they entered unto him), when they went back to Egypt and entered upon Yusuf,  ﴾قَالُواْ يأَيُّهَا الْعَزِيزُ مَسَّنَا وَأَهْلَنَا الضُّرُّ﴿ (they said: \"O Aziz! A hard time has hit us and our family...\"), because of severe droughts and the scarcity of food,  ﴾وَجِئْنَا بِبِضَاعَةٍ مُّزْجَاةٍ﴿ (and we have brought but poor capital,) means, `we brought money for the food we want to buy, but it is not substantial,' according to Mujahid, Al-Hasan and several others. Allah said that they said next,  ﴾فَأَوْفِ لَنَا الْكَيْلَ﴿ (so pay us full measure) meaning, `in return for the little money we brought, give us the full measure that you gave us before.' Ibn Mas`ud read this Ayah in a way that means, \"So give the full load on our animals and be charitable with us.\" Ibn Jurayj commented, \"So be charitable to us by returning our brother to us.\" And when Sufyan bin `Uyaynah was asked if the Sadaqah (charity) was prohibited for any Prophet before our Prophet , he said, \"Have you not heard the Ayah,  ﴾فَأَوْفِ لَنَا الْكَيْلَ وَتَصَدَّقْ عَلَيْنَآ إِنَّ اللَّهَ يَجْزِى الْمُتَصَدِّقِينَ﴿ (so pay us full measure and be charitable to us. Truly, Allah does reward the charitable.)\" Ibn Jarir At-Tabari collected this statement.  "

  12,92,"<h2>Yusuf reveals His True Identity to His Brothers and forgives Them</h2> Allah says, when Yusuf's brothers told him about the afflictions and hardship, and shortages in food they suffered from in the aftermath of the drought that struck them, and he remembered his father's grief for losing his two children, he felt compassion, pity and mercy for his father and brothers. He felt this way, especially since he was enjoying kingship, authority and power, so he cried and revealed his true identity to them when he asked them,  ﴾هَلْ عَلِمْتُمْ مَّا فَعَلْتُم بِيُوسُفَ وَأَخِيهِ إِذْ أَنتُمْ جَـهِلُونَ﴿ (Do you know what you did with Yusuf and his brother, when you were ignorant) meaning, `when you separated between Yusuf and his brother,'  ﴾إِذْ أَنتُمْ جَـهِلُونَ﴿ (when you were ignorant) He said, `What made you do this is your ignorance of the tremendous sin you were about to commit.' It appears, and Allah knows best, that Yusuf revealed his identity to his brothers only then by Allah's command, just as he hid his identity from them in the first two meetings, by Allah's command. When the affliction became harder, Allah sent His relief from that affliction, just as He said He does,  ﴾فَإِنَّ مَعَ الْعُسْرِ يُسْراً - إِنَّ مَعَ الْعُسْرِ يُسْراً ﴿ (Verily, along with every hardship is relief. Verily, along with every hardship is relief.)94:5-6 This is when they said to Yusuf,  ﴾أَءِنَّكَ لاّنتَ يُوسُفُ﴿ (Are you indeed Yusuf), in amazement, because they had been meeting him for more than two years while unaware of who he really was. Yet, he knew who they were and hid this news from them. Therefore, they asked in astonishment,  ﴾أَءِنَّكَ لاّنتَ يُوسُفُ قَالَ أَنَاْ يُوسُفُ وَهَـذَا أَخِى﴿ (Are you indeed Yusuf He said: \"I am Yusuf, and this is my brother...\") Yusuf said next,  ﴾قَدْ مَنَّ اللَّهُ عَلَيْنَآ﴿ `(Allah has indeed been gracious to us.) by gathering us together after being separated all this time,'  ﴾إِنَّهُ مَن يَتَّقِ وَيِصْبِرْ فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ لاَ يُضِيعُ أَجْرَ الْمُحْسِنِينَقَالُواْ تَاللَّهِ لَقَدْ آثَرَكَ اللَّهُ عَلَيْنَا﴿ (\"Verily, he who has Taqwa, and is patient, then surely, Allah makes not the reward of the gooddoers to be lost.\" They said: \"By Allah! Indeed Allah has preferred you above us.\") They affirmed Yusuf's virtue above them, being blessed with beauty, conduct, richness, kingship, authority and, above all, prophethood. They admitted their error and acknowledged that they made a mistake against him,  ﴾قَالَ لاَ تَثْرَيبَ عَلَيْكُمُ الْيَوْمَ﴿ (He said: \"No reproach on you this day.\") He said to them, `There will be no blame for you today or admonishment, and I will not remind you after today of your error against me.' He then multiplied his generosity by invoking Allah for them for mercy,  ﴾يَغْفِرُ اللَّهُ لَكُمْ وَهُوَ أَرْحَمُ الرَحِمِينَ﴿ (may Allah forgive you, and He is the Most Merciful of those who show mercy!)

  12,95,"<h2>Ya`qub finds the Scent of Yusuf in his Shirt!</h2> Yusuf said, `Take this shirt of mine,  ﴾فَأَلْقُوهُ عَلَى وَجْهِ أَبِى يَأْتِ بَصِيرًا﴿ (and cast it over the face of my father, his vision will return),' because Ya`qub had lost his sight from excessive crying,  ﴾وَأْتُونِى بِأَهْلِكُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ﴿ (and bring to me all your family.) all the children of Ya`qub.  ﴾وَلَمَّا فَصَلَتِ الْعِيرُ﴿ (And when the caravan departed) from Egypt,  ﴾قَالَ أَبُوهُمْ﴿ (their father said...), Ya`qub, peace be upon him, said to the children who remained with him,  ﴾إِنِّى لأَجِدُ رِيحَ يُوسُفَ لَوْلاَ أَن تُفَنِّدُونِ﴿ `(I do indeed feel the smell of Yusuf, if only you think me not senile.), except that you might think me senile because of old age.' `Abdur-Razzaq narrated that Ibn `Abbas said, \"When the caravan departed from Egypt, a wind started blowing and brought the scent of Yusuf's shirt to Ya`qub. He said,  ﴾إِنِّى لأَجِدُ رِيحَ يُوسُفَ لَوْلاَ أَن تُفَنِّدُونِ﴿ (I do indeed feel the smell of Yusuf , if only you think me not senile.) He found his scent from a distance of eight days away!\" Similar was also reported through Sufyan Ath-Thawri and Shu`bah and others reported it from Abu Sinan. Ya`qub said to them,  ﴾لَوْلاَ أَن تُفَنِّدُونِ﴿ (if only you think me not senile.) Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, `Ata, Qatadah and Sa'id bin Jubayr commented, \"If only you think me not a fool!\" Mujahid and Al-Hasan said that it means, \"If only you think me not old.\" Their answer to him was,  ﴾إِنَّكَ لَفِى ضَلَـلِكَ الْقَدِيمِ﴿ (Certainly, you are in your old Dalal.) meaning, `in your old error,' according to Ibn `Abbas. Qatadah commented, \"They meant that, `because of your love for Yusuf you will never forget him.' So they uttered a harsh word to their father that they should never have uttered to him, nor to a Prophet of Allah.\" Similar was said by As-Suddi and others.  "
