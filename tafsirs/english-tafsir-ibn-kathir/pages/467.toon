tafsir[8]{c,v,t}:
  39,75,"﴾وَقُضِىَ بَيْنَهُمْ﴿ (And they will be judged) meaning, all of creation.  ﴾بِالْحَقِّ﴿ (with truth.) Then He says:  ﴾وَقِيلَ الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ﴿ (And it will be said, \"All the praises and thanks be to Allah, the Lord of all that exits.\") meaning, all of creation, whether animate or inanimate, will speak words of praise to Allah, the Lord of all that exists, for His wisdom and justice. These words are not attributed to any specific speaker, which indicates that the whole of creation will testify to His praise. Qatadah said, \"Allah began His creation with praise, as He said,  ﴾الْحَمْدُ للَّهِ الَّذِى خَلَقَ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضَ﴿ (All praises and thanks be to Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth) (6:1). and He ended it with praise, as He says:  ﴾وَقُضِىَ بَيْنَهُمْ بِالْحَقِّ وَقِيلَ الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ﴿ (And they will be judged with truth. And it will be said, \"All the praises and thanks be to Allah, the Lord of all that exists.\").\" "

  40,3,"<h2>The Virtues of the Surahs that begin with Ha Mim</h2> Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"Everything has an essence and the essence of the Qur'an is the family of Ha Mim,\" or he said, \"the Ha Mims.\" Mis`ar bin Kidam said, \"They used to be called `the brides'.\" All of this was recorded by the the Imam, great scholar, Abu `Ubayd Al-Qasim bin Sallam, may Allah have mercy upon him, in his book Fada'il Al-Qur'an. Humayd bin Zanjuyah narrated that `Abdullah, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"The parable of the Qur'an is that of a man who sets out to find a place for his family to stay, and he comes to a place where there is evidence of rainfall. While he is walking about, admiring it, he suddenly comes upon beautiful gardens. He says, `I liked the first traces of rainfall, but this is far better.' It was said to him, `The first place is like the Qur'an, and these beautiful gardens are like the splendor of family of Ha Mim in relation to the rest of the Qur'an'.\" This was recorded by Al-Baghawi. Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"When I reach the family of Ha Mim, it is like reaching a beautiful garden, so I take my time.\"  بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ  In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.  «إِنْ بُيِّتُّمُ اللَّيْلَةَ فَقُولُوا: حم لَا يُنْصَرُون»  (When you go to bed tonight, recite Ha Mim, La Yunsarun.)\" Its chain of narrators is Sahih.  تَنزِيلُ الْكِتَـبِ مِنَ اللَّهِ الْعَزِيزِ الْعَلِيمِ  (The revelation of the Book is from Allah, the Almighty, the All-Knower.) means, this book -- the Qur'an -- is from Allah, the Owner of might and knowledge, Who cannot be overtaken and from Whom nothing is hidden, not even an ant concealed beneath many layers.  غَافِرِ الذَّنبِ وَقَابِلِ التَّوْبِ  (The Forgiver of sin, the Acceptor of repentance,) means, He forgives sins that have been committed in the past, and He accepts repentance for sins that may be committed in the future, from the one who repents and submits to Him.  شَدِيدُ الْعِقَابِ  (the Severe in punishment,) means, to the one who persists in transgression and prefers the life of this world, who stubbornly turns away from the commands of Allah and commits sin. This is like the Ayah:  نَبِّىءْ عِبَادِى أَنِّى أَنَا الْغَفُورُ الرَّحِيمُ - وَأَنَّ عَذَابِى هُوَ ٱلْعَذَابُ ٱلْأَلِيمُ  (Declare unto My servants that truly I am the Oft-Forgiving, the Most-Merciful. And that My torment is indeed the most painful torment.) (15:49-50). These two attributes (mercy and punishment) are often mentioned together in the Qur'an, so that people will remain in a state of both hope and fear.  ذِى الطَّوْلِ  (the Bestower.) Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"This means He is Generous and Rich (Independent of means).\" The meaning is that He is Most Generous to His servants, granting ongoing blessings for which they can never sufficiently thank Him.  وَإِن تَعُدُّواْ نِعْمَةَ اللَّهِ لاَ تُحْصُوهَا  (And if you would count the favors of Allah, never could you be able to count them...) (16:18).  لاَ إِلَـهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ  (La ilaha illa Huwa) means, there is none that is equal to Him in all His attributes; there is no God or Lord besides Him.  إِلَيْهِ الْمَصِيرُ  (to Him is the final return.) means, all things will come back to Him and He will reward or punish each person according to his deeds.  وَهُوَ سَرِيعُ الْحِسَابِ  (and He is Swift at reckoning) (13:41).

  40,6,"<h2>One of the Attributes of the Disbelievers is That they dispute theAyat of Allah -- and The Consequences of that Allah tells us that noone rejects or disputes His signs after clear proof has come,</h2> إِلاَّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ  (but those who disbelieve), i.e., those who reject the signs of Allah and His proof and evidence.  فَلاَ يَغْرُرْكَ تَقَلُّبُهُمْ فِى الْبِلاَدِ  (So let not their ability of going about here and there through the land deceive you!) means, their wealth and luxurious life. This is like the Ayah:  لاَ يَغُرَّنَّكَ تَقَلُّبُ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ فِى الْبِلَـدِ - مَتَـعٌ قَلِيلٌ ثُمَّ مَأْوَاهُمْ جَهَنَّمُ وَبِئْسَ الْمِهَادُ  (Let not the free disposal (and affluence) of the disbelievers throughout the land deceive you. A brief enjoyment; then, their ultimate abode is Hell; and worst indeed is that place for rest.) (3:196-197)  نُمَتِّعُهُمْ قَلِيلاً ثُمَّ نَضْطَرُّهُمْ إِلَى عَذَابٍ غَلِيظٍ  (We let them enjoy for a little while, then in the end We shall oblige them to (enter) a great torment.) (31:24). Then Allah consoles His Prophet Muhammad ﷺ for the rejection of his people. He tells him that he has an example in the Prophets who came before him, may the blessings and peace of Allah be upon them all, for their nations disbelieved them and opposed them, and only a few believed in them.  كَذَّبَتْ قَبْلَهُمْ قَوْمُ نُوحٍ  (The people of Nuh denied before these;) Nuh was the first Messenger whom Allah sent to denounce and forbid idol worship.  وَالاٌّحْزَابُ مِن بَعْدِهِمْ  (and the groups after them) means, from every nation.  وَهَمَّتْ كُـلُّ أُمَّةٍ بِرَسُولِهِمْ لِيَأْخُذُوهُ  (and every (disbelieving) nation plotted against their Messenger to seize him,) means, they wanted to kill him by any means possible, and some of them did kill their Messenger.  وَجَـدَلُوا بِالْبَـطِلِ لِيُدْحِضُواْ بِهِ الْحَقَّ  (and disputed by means of falsehood to refute therewith the truth.) means, they came up with specious arguments with which to dispute the truth which was so plain and clear.  فَأَخَذَتْهُمُ  (So I seized them) means, `I destroyed them, because of the sins they committed.'  فَكَيْفَ كَانَ عِقَابِ  (and how was My punishment!) means, `how have you heard that My punishment and vengeance was so severe and painful.' Qatadah said, \"It was terrible, by Allah.\"  وَكَذَلِكَ حَقَّتْ كَلِمَةُ رَبِّكَ عَلَى الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ أَنَّهُمْ أَصْحَـبُ النَّارِ  (Thus has the Word of your Lord been justified against those who disbelieved, that they will be the dwellers of the Fire.) means, `just as the Word of punishment was justified against those of the past nations who disbelieved, so too is it justified against these disbelievers who have rejected you and gone against you, O Muhammad, and it is even more justified against them, because if they have disbelieved in you, there is no certainty that they will believe in any other Prophet.' And Allah knows best. "
