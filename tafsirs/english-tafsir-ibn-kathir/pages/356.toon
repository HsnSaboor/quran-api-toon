tafsir[10]{c,v,t}:
  24,44,"<h2>The Power of Allah to create the Clouds and that which comes from Them</h2> Allah tells us that He drives the clouds from the beginning, when they are formed and are still weak. This is the \"Gentle driving.\" ﴾ثُمَّ يُؤَلِّفُ بَيْنَهُ﴿ (then joins them together,) means, He brings them together after they have been scattered. ﴾ثُمَّ يَجْعَلُهُ رُكَاماً﴿ (then makes them into a heap of layers,) means, He piles them up on top of one another. ﴾فَتَرَى الْوَدْقَ﴿ (and you see the Wadq) meaning the rain, ﴾يَخْرُجُ مِنْ خِلاَلِهِ﴿ (come forth from between them;) means, from the gaps between them. This is how it was understood by Ibn `Abbas and Ad-Dahhak. `Ubayd bin `Umayr Al-Laythi said: \"Allah sends the scatterer wind, which stirs up that which is on the surface of the earth. Then he sends the generator wind, which forms the clouds. Then He sends the joiner wind which brings them together. Then He sends the fertilizer wind which fertilizes or `seeds' the clouds.\" This was recorded by Ibn Abi Hatim and Ibn Jarir. ﴾وَيُنَزِّلُ مِنَ السَّمَآءِ مِن جِبَالٍ فِيهَا مِن بَرَدٍ﴿ (and He sends down from Min the sky, from Min mountains in it of Min ice,) Some of the grammarians said that the first Min describes the place from which it is coming, the second specifies from which part of the sky it comes, and the third means some kind of mountains. This is based on the view of those scholars of Tafsir who say that, ﴾مِن جِبَالٍ فِيهَا مِن بَرَدٍ﴿ (from Min mountains in it of Min ice) means that there are mountains of hail in the sky from which Allah sends down ice. As for those who say that \"mountains\" here is used as a metaphor for clouds, they think that the second Min is also used to describe the place from which the ice is coming, and is thus interchangeable with the first. And Allah knows best. ﴾فَيُصِيبُ بِهِ مَن يَشَآءُ وَيَصْرِفُهُ عَن مَّن يَشَآءُ﴿ (and strikes therewith whom He wills, and averts it from whom He wills.) It may be that the phrase ﴾فَيُصِيبُ بِهِ﴿ (and strikes therewith) means, with what He sends down from the sky of different kinds of rain and hail. So then the phrase ﴾فَيُصِيبُ بِهِ مَن يَشَآءُ﴿ (and strikes therewith whom He wills) means, by His mercy towards them, and ﴾وَيَصْرِفُهُ عَن مَّن يَشَآءُ﴿ (and averts it from whom He wills. ) means, He withholds rain from them. Or it may be that ﴾فَيُصِيبُ بِهِ﴿ (and strikes therewith) means, with hail, as a punishment towards whomever He wills, striking their fruits and destroying their crops and trees. And He averts it from whomever He wills as a mercy towards them. ﴾يَكَادُ سَنَا بَرْقِهِ يَذْهَبُ بِالاٌّبْصَـرِ﴿ (The vivid flash of its lightning nearly blinds the sight.) the brightness of its lightning almost takes away their sight if the eyes follow it and try to look at it. ﴾يُقَلِّبُ اللَّهُ الَّيْلَ وَالنَّهَارَ﴿ (Allah causes the night and the day to succeed each other.) He is controlling them, so that He takes something from the length of one and adds it to the other, which is short, until they become equal, then He does the opposite so that the one which was short becomes long and vice versa. Allah is the One Who is controlling that by His command, power, might and knowledge. ﴾إِنَّ فِى ذَلِكَ لَعِبْرَةً لاوْلِى الاٌّبْصَـرِ﴿ (Truly, in this is indeed a lesson for those who have insight.) means, this is an indication of His greatness, may He be exalted. This is like the Ayah: ﴾إِنَّ فِى خَلْقِ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ وَاخْتِلَـفِ الَّيْلِ وَالنَّهَارِ لاّيَـتٍ لاٌّوْلِى الاٌّلْبَـبِ ﴿ (Verily, in the creation of the heavens and the earth, and in the alternation of night and day, there are indeed signs for men of understanding.) 3:190 and thereafter. "
  24,45,"<h2>Allah's Power in His creation of the Animals</h2> Allah mentions His complete and almighty power to create all the different kinds of animals with their various forms, colors and ways of moving and stopping, from one kind of water. ﴾فَمِنْهُمْ مَّن يَمْشِى عَلَى بَطْنِهِ﴿ (Of them there are some that creep on their bellies,) like snakes and so on; ﴾وَمِنهُمْ مَّن يَمْشِى عَلَى رِجْلَيْنِ﴿ (and some that walk on two legs,) like humans and birds; ﴾وَمِنْهُمْ مَّن يَمْشِى عَلَى أَرْبَعٍ﴿ (and some that walk on four,) like cattle and all kinds of animals. Allah says: ﴾يَخْلُقُ اللَّهُ مَا يَشَآءُ﴿ (Allah creates what He wills.) meaning by His power, because what He wills happens and what He does not will does not happen. So he says: ﴾إِنَّ اللَّهَ عَلَى كُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدِيرٌ﴿ (Verily, Allah is able to do all things.) "
  24,46,"﴾وَاللَّهُ يَهْدِى مَن يَشَآءُ إِلَى صِرَاطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ﴿ (And Allah guides whom He wills to the Straight Path.) "

  24,52,"<h2>The Treachery of the Hypocrites and the Attitude of the Believers</h2> Allah tells us about the characteristics of the hypocrites who show one thing while hiding another, and who say with their tongues, ﴾آمَنَّا بِاللَّهِ وَبِالرَّسُولِ وَأَطَعْنَا ثُمَّ يَتَوَلَّى فَرِيقٌ مِّنْهُمْ مِّن بَعْدِ ذلِكَ﴿ (\"We have believed in Allah and in the Messenger, and we obey,\" then a party of them turn away thereafter,) meaning, their actions contradict their deeds, and they say that which they do not do. Allah says: ﴾وَمَآ أُوْلَـئِكَ بِالْمُؤْمِنِينَ﴿ (such are not believers.) ﴾وَإِذَا دُعُواْ إِلَى اللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ لِيَحْكُمَ بَيْنَهُمْ﴿ (And when they are called to Allah and His Messenger, to judge between them...) means, when they are asked to follow the guidance which Allah has revealed to His Messenger , they turn away and are too arrogantly proud of themselves to follow him. This is like the Ayah: ﴾أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى الَّذِينَ يَزْعُمُونَ أَنَّهُمْ ءَامَنُواْ بِمَآ أُنزِلَ إِلَيْكَ وَمَآ أُنزِلَ مِن قَبْلِكَ﴿ (Have you not seen those who claim that they believe in that which has been sent down to you, and that which was sent down before you,) until His saying: ﴾رَأَيْتَ الْمُنَـفِقِينَ يَصُدُّونَ عَنكَ صُدُوداً﴿ (you see the hypocrites turn away from you with aversion) 4: 60-61. ﴾وَإِن يَكُنْ لَّهُمُ الْحَقُّ يَأْتُواْ إِلَيْهِ مُذْعِنِينَ ﴿ (But if the truth is on their side, they come to him willingly with submission.) means, if the ruling will be in their favor and not against them, then they will come and will listen and obey, which is what is meant by the phrase ﴾مُذْعِنِينَ﴿ (willingly with submission.) But if the ruling will go against him, he turns away and demands something that goes against the truth, and he prefers to refer for judgement to someone other than the Prophet so that his false claims may prevail. His acceptance in the beginning was not because he believed that it was the truth, but because it happened to be in accordance with his desires. So when the truth went against what he was hoping for, he turned away from it. Allah said: ﴾أَفِى قُلُوبِهِمْ مَّرَضٌ﴿ (Is there a disease in their hearts...) meaning, their situation cannot be anything else, they must necessarily have a disease in their hearts, or else they have some doubts about the religion, or they are afraid that Allah and His Messenger will be unjust in their ruling against them. Whichever it is, it is pure disbelief, and Allah knows which of these characteristics each one of them has. d ﴾بَلْ أُوْلَـئِكَ هُمُ الظَّـلِمُونَ﴿ (Nay, it is they themselves who are the wrongdoers.) means, they are the evildoers who commit immoral actions, and Allah and His Messenger are innocent of the injustice and unfairness that they imagine; exalted be Allah and His Messenger above such a thing. Then Allah tells us about the attributes of the believers who respond to Allah and His Messenger and who seek no other way apart from the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Messenger . Allah says: ﴾إِنَّمَا كَانَ قَوْلَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ إِذَا دُعُواْ إِلَى اللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ لِيَحْكُمَ بَيْنَهُمْ أَن يَقُولُواْ سَمِعْنَا وَأَطَعْنَا﴿ (The only saying of the faithful believers, when they are called to Allah and His Messenger, to judge between them, is that they say: \"We hear and we obey\".) meaning, to hear to obey. Allah describes them as having attained success, which is achieving what one wants and being saved from what one fears. So Allah says: ﴾وَأُوْلَـئِكَ هُمُ الْمُفْلِحُونَ﴿ (And such are the successful.) Concerning the Ayah: ﴾أَن يَقُولُواْ سَمِعْنَا وَأَطَعْنَا﴿ (they say: \"We hear and we obey\".), Qatadah said: \"We were told that when `Ubadah bin As-Samit, who had been present at Al-`Aqabah and at Badr, and was one of the leaders of the Ansar, was dying, he said to his nephew Junadah bin Abi Umayyah: `Shall I not tell you what you must do and what is your due' He said, `Yes.' He said: `You have to listen and obey when times are easy and when they are hard, when you feel energetic and when you do not want to, and when you feel selfish. You have to train your tongue to speak the truth. Do not go against those who are in authority, unless they openly command you to commit acts of disobedience to Allah. Whenever you are commanded to do something that goes against the Book of Allah, then follow the Book of Allah.\"' Qatadah said: We were told that Abu Ad-Darda' said, \"There is no Islam except through obedience to Allah, and no goodness except in Jama`ah. Sincerity is to Allah and His Messenger , and to the Khalifah and all the believers.\" He said: \"And we were told that `Umar bin Al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him, used to say; `The bonds of Islam are La ilaha illallah, establishing prayer, paying Zakah and obeying those whom Allah has given authority over the affairs of the Muslims.\"' This was recorded by Ibn Abi Hatim. There are very many Hadiths and reports which state that it is obligatory to obey the Book of Allah, the Sunnah of His Messenger, the Rightly-Guided Khalifahs and the Imams when they command us to obey Allah; there are too many of these reports to quote them all here. ﴾وَمَن يُطِعِ اللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ﴿ (And whosoever obeys Allah and His Messenger,) in what he is commanded with, and avoid what he is forbidden, ﴾وَيَخْشَ اللَّهَ﴿ (fears Allah, ) means, for his past sins, ﴾وَيَتَّقْهِ﴿ (and has Taqwa of Him,) regarding sins he may commit in the future. ﴾فَأُوْلَـئِكَ هُمُ الْفَآئِزُون﴿ (such are the successful.) means, those who will attain all goodness and be saved from all evil in this world and the Hereafter.
