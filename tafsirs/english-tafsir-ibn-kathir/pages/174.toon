tafsir[9]{c,v,t}:
  7,179,"<h2>Disbelief and the Divine Decree</h2> Allah said,  وَلَقَدْ ذَرَأْنَا لِجَهَنَّمَ  (And surely, We have created for Hell) We made a share in the Fire for,  كَثِيرًا مِّنَ الْجِنِّ وَالإِنْسِ  (many of the Jinn and mankind) We prepared them for it by their performance of the deeds of its people. When Allah intended to create the creation, He knew what their work will be before they existed. He wrote all this in a Book, kept with Him, fifty thousand years before He created the heavens and earth. Muslim recorded that `Abdullah bin `Amr narrated that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,  «إِنَّ اللهَ قَدَّرَ مَقَادِيرَ الْخَلْقِ قَبْلَ أَنْ يَخْلُقَ السَّمَوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ بِخَمْسِينَ أَلْفَ سَنَةٍ وَكَانَ عَرْشُهُ عَلَى الْمَاء»  (Verily, Allah decided the destination and due measurement of the creation fifty thousand years before He created the heavens and earth, and His Throne was over the water.) There are many Hadiths on this subject, and certainly, the matter of Al-Qadar is of utmost importance, yet this is not where we should discuss it. Allah said,  لَهُمْ قُلُوبٌ لاَّ يَفْقَهُونَ بِهَا وَلَهُمْ أَعْيُنٌ لاَّ يُبْصِرُونَ بِهَا وَلَهُمْ ءَاذَانٌ لاَّ يَسْمَعُونَ بِهَآ  (They have hearts wherewith they understand not, and they have eyes wherewith they see not, and they have ears wherewith they hear not.) meaning, they do not benefit from these senses that Allah made for them as a means of gaining guidance. Similarly, Allah said,  وَجَعَلْنَا لَهُمْ سَمْعاً وَأَبْصَـراً وَأَفْئِدَةً فَمَآ أَغْنَى عَنْهُمْ سَمْعُهُمْ وَلاَ أَبْصَـرُهُمْ وَلاَ أَفْئِدَتُهُمْ مِّن شَىْءٍ إِذْ كَانُواْ يَجْحَدُونَ بِـَايَـتِ اللَّهِ  (And We had assigned them the (faculties of) hearing, seeing, and hearts; but their hearing, seeing, and their hearts availed them nothing since they used to deny the Ayat.) 46:26. Allah also said about the hypocrites,  صُمٌّ بُكْمٌ عُمْىٌ فَهُمْ لاَ يَرْجِعُونَ  ((They are) deaf, dumb, and blind, so they return not (to the right path)) 2:18, and about the disbelievers,  صُمٌّ بُكْمٌ عُمْىٌ فَهُمْ لاَ يَعْقِلُونَ  ((They are) deaf, dumb and blind. So they do not understand.) 2:171 However, they are not deaf, dumb or blind, except relation to the guidance. Allah said;  وَلَوْ عَلِمَ اللَّهُ فِيهِمْ خَيْرًا لأَسْمَعَهُمْ وَلَوْ أَسْمَعَهُمْ لَتَوَلَّواْ وَّهُم مُّعْرِضُونَ  (Had Allah known of any good in them, He would indeed have made them listen; and even if He had made them listen, they would but have turned away with aversion (to the truth).) 8:23,  فَإِنَّهَا لاَ تَعْمَى الاٌّبْصَـرُ وَلَـكِن تَعْمَى الْقُلُوبُ الَّتِى فِى الصُّدُورِ  (Verily, it is not the eyes that grow blind, but it is the hearts which are in the breasts that grow blind.) 22:46, and,  وَمَن يَعْشُ عَن ذِكْرِ الرَّحْمَـنِ نُقَيِّضْ لَهُ شَيْطَاناً فَهُوَ لَهُ قَرِينٌ - وَإِنَّهُمْ لَيَصُدُّونَهُمْ عَنِ السَّبِيلِ وَيَحْسَبُونَ أَنَّهُم مُّهْتَدُونَ  (And whosoever turns away blindly from the remembrance of the Most Gracious (Allah), We appoint for him Shaytan to be an intimate companion to him. And verily, they hinder them from the path, but they think that they are guided aright!)43:36-37 Allah's statement,  أُوْلَـئِكَ كَالأَنْعَـمِ  (They are like cattle), means, those who neither hear the truth, nor understand it, nor see the guidance, are just like grazing cattle that do not benefit from these senses, except for what sustains their life in this world. Allah said in a similar Ayah,  وَمَثَلُ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ كَمَثَلِ الَّذِى يَنْعِقُ بِمَا لاَ يَسْمَعُ إِلاَّ دُعَآءً وَنِدَآءً  (And the example of those who disbelieve is as that of one who shouts to those who hear nothing but calls and cries.) 2:171 meaning, their example, when they are called to the faith, is the example of cattle that hear only the voice of their shepherd, but cannot understand what he is saying. Allah further described them  بَلْ هُمْ أَضَلُّ  (nay even more astray), than cattle, because cattle still respond to the call of their shepherd, even though they do not understand what he is saying. As for the people described here, they are unlike cattle, which fulfill the purpose and service they were created for. The disbeliever was created to worship Allah alone in Tawhid, but he disbelieved in Allah and associated others in His worship. Therefore, those people who obey Allah are more honorable than some angels, while cattle are better than those who disbelieve in Him. So Allah said;  أُوْلَـئِكَ كَالأَنْعَـمِ بَلْ هُمْ أَضَلُّ أُوْلَـئِكَ هُمُ الْغَـفِلُونَ  (They are like cattle, nay even more astray; those! They are the heedless ones.) "
  7,180,"<h2>Allah's Most Beautiful Names</h2> Abu Hurayrah narrated that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,  «إِنَّ للهِ تِسْعًا وَتِسْعِينَ اسْمًا مِائَةً إِلَّا وَاحِدًا، مَنْ أَحْصَاهَا دَخَلَ الْجَنَّةَ وَهُوَ وِتْرٌ يُحِبُّ الْوِتْر»  (Verily, Allah has ninety-nine Names, a hundred less one; whoever counts (and preserves) them, will enter Paradise. Allah is Witr (One) and loves Al-Witr (the odd numbered things),) The Two Sahihs collected this Hadith. We should state that Allah's Names are not restricted to only ninety-nine. For instance, in his Musnad, Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said;  «مَا أَصَابَ أَحَدًا قَطُّ هَمٌّ وَلَا حَزَنٌ فَقَالَ: اللَّهُمَّ إِنِّي عَبْدُكَ، ابْنُ أَمَتِكَ، نَاصِيَتِي بِيَدِكَ مَاضٍ فِيَّ حُكْمُكَ، عَدْلٌ فِيَّ قَضُاؤُكَ، أَسْأَلُكَ بِكُلِّ اسْمٍ هُوَ لَكَ سَمَّيْتَ بِهِ نَفْسَكَ أَوْ أَنْزَلْتَهُهِفي كِتَابِكَ أَوْ عَلَّمْتَهُ أَحَدًا مِنْ خَلْقِكَ أَوِ اسْتَأْثَرْتَ بِهِ فِي عِلْمِ الْغَيْبِ عِنْدَكَ أَنْ تَجْعَلَ الْقُرآنَ الْعَظِيمَ رَبِيعَ قَلْبِي، وَنُورَ صَدْرِي، وَجَلَاءَ حُزْنِي، وَذَهَابَ هَمِّي، إِلَّا أَذْهَبَ اللهُ حُزْنَهُ وَهَمَّهُ وَأَبْدَلَ مَكَانَهُ فَرَحًا»  (Any person who is overcome by sadness or grief and supplicates, `O Allah! I am Your servant, son of Your female servant. My forelock is in Your Hand. Your decision concerning me shall certainly come to pass. Just is Your Judgement about me. I invoke You by every Name that You have and that You called Yourself by, sent down in Your Book, taught to any of Your creatures, or kept with You in the knowledge of the Unseen that is with You. Make the Glorious Qur'an the spring of my heart, the light of my chest, the remover of my grief and the dissipater of my concern.' Surely, Allah will remove his grief and sadness and exchange them for delight.) The Prophet was asked \"O Messenger of Allah! Should we learn these words\" He said,  «بَلَى يَنْبَغِي لِكُلِّ مَنْ سَمِعَهَا أَنْ يَتَعَلَّمَهَا»  (Yes. It is an obligation on all those who hear this supplication to learn it.) Al-`Awfi said that Ibn `Abbas said about Allah's statement,  وَذَرُواْ الَّذِينَ يُلْحِدُونَ فِى أَسْمَـئِهِ  (and leave the company of those who belie His Names) \"To belie Allah's Names includes saying that Al-Lat (an idol) derived from Allah's Name.\" Ibn Jurayj narrated from Mujahid that he commented,  وَذَرُواْ الَّذِينَ يُلْحِدُونَ فِى أَسْمَـئِهِ  (and leave the company of those who belie His Names) \"They derived Al-Lat (an idol's name) from Allah, and Al-`Uzza (another idol) from Al-`Aziz (the All-Mighty).\" Qatadah stated that Ilhad refers to associating others with Allah in His Names (such as calling an idol Al-`Uzza). The word Ilhad used in the Ayah in another from means deviation, wickedness, injustice and straying. The hole in the grave is called Lahd, because it is a hole within a hole, that is turned towards the Qiblah (the direction of the prayer). "
  7,181," وَمِمَّنْ خَلَقْنَآ  (And of those whom We have created), in reference to some nations,  أُمَّةٍ  (a community), that stands in truth, in words and action,  يَهْدُونَ بِالْحَقِّ  (who guides (others) with the truth), they proclaim it and call to it,  وَبِهِ يَعْدِلُونَ  (and establishes justice therewith), adhere to it themselves and judge by it. It was reported that this Ayah refers to the Ummah of Muhammad ﷺ. In the Two Sahihs, it is recorded that Mu`awiyah bin Abi Sufyan said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,  «لَا تَزَالُ طَائِفَةٌ مِنْ أُمَّتِي ظَاهِرِينَ عَلَى الْحَقِّ لَا يَضُرُّهُمْ مَنْ خَذَلَهُمْ وَلَا مَنْ خَالَفَهُمْ حَتَّى تَقُومَ السَّاعَة»  (There will always be a group of my Ummah who are apparent on the Truth, unabated by those who fail or oppose them, until the (Last) Hour commences.) rIn another narration, the Messenger  ﷺ said,  «حَتَّى يَأْتِيَ أَمْرُ اللهِ وَهُمْ عَلَى ذَلِك»  (Until Allah's command (the Last Hour) comes while they are still like this. ) and in yet another narration,  «وَهُمْ بِالشَّام»  (And they will dwell in Ash-Sham (Greater Syria).) "

  7,183,"﴾وَالَّذِينَ كَذَّبُواْ بِـَايَـتِنَا سَنَسْتَدْرِجُهُم مِّنْ حَيْثُ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ ﴿ (Those who reject Our Ayat, We shall gradually seize them in ways they perceive not) meaning, the doors of provisions will be opened for them and also the means of livelihood, in this life. They will be deceived by all this and think that they are on the correct path. Allah said in another instance,  ﴾فَلَمَّا نَسُواْ مَا ذُكِّرُواْ بِهِ فَتَحْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ أَبْوَابَ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ حَتَّى إِذَا فَرِحُواْ بِمَآ أُوتُواْ أَخَذْنَـهُمْ بَغْتَةً فَإِذَا هُمْ مُّبْلِسُونَ - فَقُطِعَ دَابِرُ الْقَوْمِ الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ وَالْحَمْدُ للَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ ﴿ (So, when they forgot (the warning) with which they had been reminded, We opened for them the gates of every (pleasant) thing, until in the midst of their enjoyment in that which they were given, all of a sudden, We took them (in punishment), and lo! They were plunged into destruction with deep regrets and sorrow. So the root of the people who did wrong was cut off. And all the praises and thanks are to Allah, the Lord of all that exists.)6:44-45. Allah said here,  ﴾وَأَمْلَى لَهُمْ﴿ (And I respite them) prolong what they are in,  ﴾إِنَّ كَيْدِى مَتِينٌ﴿ (certainly My plan is strong) and perfect.  "
  7,184," أَوَلَمْ يَتَفَكَّرُواْ  (Do they not reflect) `those who deny Our Ayat,'  مَا بِصَاحِبِهِم  (there is not in their companion), Muhammad ,  مِّن جِنَّةٍ  (madness) Muhammad is not mad, rather, he is truly the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, calling to Truth,  إِنْ هُوَ إِلاَّ نَذِيرٌ مُّبِينٌ  (but he is a plain warner), and this is clear for those who have a mind and a heart by which they understand and comprehend. Allah said in another Ayah,  وَمَا صَـحِبُكُمْ بِمَجْنُونٍ  (And (O people) your companion is not a madman.)81:22 Allah also said,  قُلْ إِنَّمَآ أَعِظُكُمْ بِوَحِدَةٍ أَن تَقُومُواْ لِلَّهِ مَثْنَى وَفُرَادَى ثُمَّ تَتَفَكَّرُواْ مَا بِصَـحِبِكُمْ مِّن جِنَّةٍ إِنْ هُوَ إِلاَّ نَذِيرٌ لَّكُمْ بَيْنَ يَدَىْ عَذَابٍ شَدِيدٍ  (Say: \"I exhort you to one (thing) only, that you stand up for Allah's sake in pairs and singly, and reflect, there is no madness in your companion. He is only a warner to you in face of a severe torment.\") 34:46 meaning, `I ask you to stand for Allah in sincerity without stubbornness or bias,'  مَثْنَى وَفُرَادَى  (in pairs and singly) 34:46 individuals and in groups,  ثُمَّ تَتَفَكَّرُواْ  (and reflect) 34:46, about this man who brought the Message from Allah, is he mad If you do this, it will become clear to you that he is the Messenger of Allah ﷺ in truth and justice. Qatadah bin Di'amah said, \"We were informed that the Prophet of Allah once was on (Mount) As-Safa and called the Quraysh, subtribe by subtribe, proclaiming,  «يَا بَنِي فُلَانٍ، يَا بَنِي فُلَانٍ فَحَذَّرَهُمْ بَأْسَ اللهِ وَوَقَائِعَ الله»  (O Children of so-and-so, O Children of so-and-so! He warned them against Allah's might and what He has done (such as revenge from His enemies).) Some of them commented, `This companion of yours (Prophet Muhammad) is mad; he kept shouting until the morning' Allah sent down this Ayah,  أَوَلَمْ يَتَفَكَّرُواْ مَا بِصَاحِبِهِم مِّن جِنَّةٍ إِنْ هُوَ إِلاَّ نَذِيرٌ مُّبِينٌ  (Do they not reflect There is no madness in their companion. He is but a plain warner) 7:184.\"' "
  7,185," فَبِأَىِّ حَدِيثٍ بَعْدَهُ يُؤْمِنُونَ  (In what message after this will they then believe) Allah says, what more warnings, and discouragements should compel them to believe, if the warnings and threats that Muhammad ﷺ brought them from Allah in His Book do not compel them to do so Allah said next, "
  7,186,"﴾وَمَن يُرِدِ اللَّهُ فِتْنَتَهُ فَلَن تَمْلِكَ لَهُ مِنَ اللَّهِ شَيْئاً﴿ (And whomsoever Allah wants to put in Fitnah (error, because of his rejecting of Faith, or trial), you can do nothing for him against Allah) 5:41, and,  ﴾قُلِ انظُرُواْ مَاذَا فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ وَمَا تُغْنِى الآيَـتُ وَالنُّذُرُ عَن قَوْمٍ لاَّ يُؤْمِنُونَ ﴿ (Say: \"Behold all that is in the heavens and the earth,\" but neither Ayat nor warners benefit those who believe not) 10:101.  "
  7,187,"<h2>The Last Hour and its Portents</h2> Allah said here,  يَسْـَلُونَكَ عَنِ السَّاعَةِ  (They ask you about the Hour), just as He said in another Ayah,  يَسْـَلُكَ النَّاسُ عَنِ السَّاعَةِ  (People ask you concerning the Hour) 33:63. It was said that this Ayah was revealed about the Quraysh or the Jews, although it appears that it was about the Quraysh, because this Ayah was revealed in Makkah. The Quraysh used to ask about the Last Hour, because they used to deny it and discount its coming. For instance, Allah said in another Ayah,  وَيَقُولُونَ مَتَى هَـذَا الْوَعْدُ إِن كُنتُمْ صَـدِقِينَ  (And they say: \"When will be this promise (the torment or the Day of Resurrection), if you speak the truth\") 10:48, and,  يَسْتَعْجِلُ بِهَا الَّذِينَ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِهَا وَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ مُشْفِقُونَ مِنْهَا وَيَعْلَمُونَ أَنَّهَا الْحَقُّ أَلاَ إِنَّ الَّذِينَ يُمَارُونَ فَى السَّاعَةِ لَفِى ضَلَـلَ بَعِيدٍ  (Those who believe not therein seek to hasten it, while those who believe are fearful of it, and know that it is the very truth. Verily, those who dispute concerning the Hour are certainly in error far away) 42:18. Allah said here (that the Quraysh asked),  أَيَّانَ مُرْسَـهَا  (\"When will be its appointed time\") in reference to its commencement, according to `Ali bin Abi Talhah who reported this from Ibn `Abbas. They asked about the Hour's appointed term and when the end of this world will begin;  قُلْ إِنَّمَا عِلْمُهَا عِنْدَ رَبِّي لاَ يُجَلِّيهَا لِوَقْتِهَآ إِلاَّ هُوَ  (Say: \"The knowledge thereof is with my Lord (Alone). None can reveal its time but He.\") Allah commanded His Messenger that when asked about the appointed term of the Last Hour, he referred its knowledge to Allah, the Exalted. Only Allah knows the Last Hour's appointed term and when it will certainly occur, and none besides Him has this knowledge,  ثَقُلَتْ فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ  (Heavy is its burden through the heavens and the earth) `Abdur-Razzaq narrated that Ma`mar said that Qatadah commented on this Ayah,  ثَقُلَتْ فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ  (Heavy is its burden through the heavens and the earth) \"Its knowledge is heavy on the residents of the heavens and earth, they do not have knowledge in it.\" Also, Ma`mar said that Al-Hasan commented on this Ayah, \"When the Last Hour comes, it will be heavy on the residents of the heavens and earth.\" Ad-Dahhak said that Ibn `Abbas explained this Ayah,  ثَقُلَتْ فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ  (Heavy is its burden through the heavens and the earth, ) saying, \"All creatures will suffer its heaviness on the Day of Resurrection.\" Ibn Jurayj also said about this Ayah,  ثَقُلَتْ فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ  (Heavy is its burden through the heavens and the earth.) \"When it commences, the heavens will be torn, the stars will scatter all over, the sun will be wound round (thus losing its light), the mountains will be made to pass away and all of which Allah spoke of will occur. This is the meaning of its burden being heavy.\" As-Suddi said that,  ثَقُلَتْ فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ  (Heavy is its burden through the heavens and the earth) means, its knowledge is hidden in the heavens and earth, and none, not even a close angel or a sent Messenger has knowledge of its appointed time.  لاَ تَأْتِيكُمْ إِلاَّ بَغْتَةً  (It shall not come upon you except all of a sudden) indicating that the Hour will start all of a sudden, while they are unaware. Qatadah said, \"Allah has decided that,  لاَ تَأْتِيكُمْ إِلاَّ بَغْتَةً  (It shall not come upon you except all of a sudden.) He then said, \"We were informed that Allah's Prophet said,  «إِنَّ السَّاعَةَ تَهِيجُ بِالنَّاسِ، وَالرَّجُلُ يُصْلِحُ حَوْضَهُ وَالرَّجُلُ يَسْقِي مَاشِيَتَهُ، وَالرَّجُلُ يُقِمُ سِلْعَتَهُ فِي السُّوقِ وَيَخْفِضُ مِيزَانَهُ وَيَرْفَعُه»  The Hour will start (suddenly) for the people while one is mending his watering hole, giving water to his cattle, setting his goods in the market or lowering his scale and raising it (selling and buying).\"' Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,  «لَا تَقُومُ السَّاعَةُ حَتَّى تَطْلُعَ الشَّمْسُ مِنْ مَغْرِبِهَا، فَإِذَ طَلَعَتْ فَرَآهَا النَّاسُ آمَنُوا أَجْمَعُونَ، فَذَلِكَ حِينَ لَا يَنْفَعُ نَفْسًا إِيمَانُهَا لَمْ تَكُنْ آمَنَتْ مِنْ قَبْلُ أَوْ كَسَبَتْ فِي إِيمَانِهَا خَيْرًا، وَلَتَقُومَنَّ السَّاعَةُ وَقَدْ نَشَرَ الرَّجُلَانِ ثَوْبَهُمَا بَيْنَهُمَا، فَلَا يَتَبَايَعَانِهِ وَلَا يَطْوِيَانِهِ. وَلَتَقُومَنَّ السَّاعَةُ وَقَدِ انْصَرَفَ الرَّجُلُ بِلَبَنِ لِقْحَتِهِ فَلَا يَطْعَمُهُ، وَلَتَقُومَنَّ السَّاعَةُ وَهُو يَلِيطُ حَوْضَهُ فَلَا يَسْقِي فِيهِ، وَلَتَقُومَنَّ السَّاعَةُ وَالرَّجُلُ قَدْ رَفَعَ أَكْلَتَهُ إِلَى فِيهِ فَلَا يَطْعَمُهَا»  (The Hour will not commence until the sun rises from the west. When it rises (from the west) and the people see it, then, all people will believe. However, this is when faith does not benefit a soul that did not believe beforehand nor earned good in faith. The Hour will (all of a sudden) commence while two men have spread a garment between them, and they will neither have time to conclude the transaction nor to fold the garment. The Hour will commence after a man milked his animal, but he will not have time to drink it. The Hour will start when a man is making his watering hole (for his animals), but will not have time to make use of the pool. And the Hour will commence while a man has raised his hand with a bite to his mouth, but will not eat it.) Al-`Awfi said that Ibn `Abbas commented on the Ayah,  يَسْـَلُونَكَ كَأَنَّكَ حَفِىٌّ عَنْهَا  (They ask you as if you have good knowledge of it.) \"As if you have good relations and friendship with them!\" Ibn `Abbas said, \"When the people (pagans of Quraysh) asked the Prophet about the Last Hour, they did so in a way as if Muhammad was their friend! Allah revealed to him that its knowledge is with Him Alone and He did not inform a close angel or Messenger of it.\" The correct explanation for this Ayah is, as narrated from Mujahid, through Ibn Abi Najih,  يَسْـَلُونَكَ كَأَنَّكَ حَفِىٌّ عَنْهَا  (They ask you as if you have Hafi of it.) means, `as if you had asked about its time and so its knowledge is with you.' Allah said,  قُلْ إِنَّمَا عِلْمُهَا عِندَ اللَّهِ وَلَـكِنَّ أَكْثَرَ النَّاسِ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ  (Say: \"The knowledge thereof is with Allah (Alone), but most of mankind know not.\") When Jibril came in the shape of a bedouin man to teach the people matters of their religion, he sat next to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ asking him as if to learn. Jibril asked the Messenger about Islam, then about Iman (faith) then about Ihsan (Excellence in the religion). He asked next, \"When will the Hour start\" Allah's Messenger ﷺ said,  «مَا الْمَسْؤُولُ عَنْهَا بِأَعْلَمَ مِنَ السَّائِل»  (He who is asked about it has no more knowledge of it than the questioner.) Therefore, the Prophet was saying, `I have no more knowledge in it than you (O Jibril), nor does anyone have more knowledge in it than anyone else.' The Prophet then recited the Ayah,  إِنَّ اللَّهَ عِندَهُ عِلْمُ السَّاعَةِ  (Verily, Allah, with Him (Alone) is the knowledge of the Hour.) 31:34 In another narration, Jibril asked the Prophet about the portents of the Hour, and the Prophet mentioned them. The Prophet also said in this narration,  «فِي خَمْسٍ لَا يَعْلَمُهُنَّ إِلَّا الله»  (Five, their knowledge is only with Allah) then recited this Ayah (31:34). In response to the Prophet's answers after each question, Jibril would say, \"You have said the truth.\" This made the Companions wonder about this questioner who would ask a question and attest to every answer he was given. When Jibril went away, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to the Companions,  «هَذَا جِبْرِيلُ أَتَاكُمْ يُعَلِّمُكُمْ دِينَكُم»  (This is Jibril, he came to teach you matters of your religion.) In yet another narration, the Prophet commented,  «وَمَا أَتَانِي فِي صُورَةٍ إِلَّا عَرَفْتُهُ فِيهَا إِلَّا صُورَتُهُ هَذِه»  (I recognized him (Jibril) in every shape he came to me in, except this one.) Muslim recorded that `Aishah, may Allah be pleased with her, said; \"When the bedouins used to come to the Prophet , they used to ask him about the Hour. The Prophet would answer them, while pointing at the youngest person among them,  «إِنْ يَعِشْ هَذَا لَمْ يُدْرِكْهُ الْهَرَمُ حَتَّى قَامَتْ عَلَيْكُمْ سَاعَتُكُم»  (If this (young man) lives, he will not become old before your Hour starts.) The Prophet meant the end of their life that introduces them to the life in Barzakh, which is between this life and the Hereafter. Muslim recorded that Anas said that a man asked Allah's Messenger ﷺ about the Hour, and the Messenger ﷺ answered,  «إِنْ يَعِشْ هَذَا الْغُلَامُ فَعَسَى أَنْ لَا يُدْرِكَهُ الْهَرَمُ حَتَّى تَقُومَ السَّاعَة»  (If this young boy lives, it might be that he will not become old before the Hour starts.) Only Muslim collected this Hadith. Jabir bin `Abdullah said, \"I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ saying, one month before he died,  «تَسْأَلُونِي عَنِ السَّاعَةِ، وَإِنَّمَا عِلْمُهَا عِنْدَ اللهِ، وَأُقْسِمُ بِاللهِ مَا عَلَى ظَهْرِ الْأَرْضِ الْيَوْمَ مِنْ نَفْسٍ مَنْفُوسَةٍ تَأْتِي عَلَيْهَا مِائَةُ سَنَة»  (You keep asking me about the Hour, when its knowledge is with Allah. I swear by Allah that there is no living soul on the face of the earth now will be alive a hundred years from now.) Muslim collected this Hadith. A similar Hadith is recorded in Two Sahihs from Ibn `Umar, but he commented, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ meant that his generation will be finished by that time reach its appointed term.\" Imam Ahmad recorded that Ibn Mas`ud said that the Prophet said,  «لَقِيتُ لَيْلَةَ أُسْرِيَ بِي إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَمُوسَى وَعِيسَى، فَتَذَاكَرُوا أَمْرَ السَّاعَةِ قَالَ فَرَدُّوْا أَمْرَهُمْ إِلَى إِبْرَاهِيمَ عَلَيهِ السَّلَامُ، فَقَالَ: لَا عِلْمَ لِي بِهَا، فَرَدُّوا أَمْرَهُمْ إِلَى مُوسَى فَقَالَ: لَا عِلْمَ لِي بِهَا، فَرَدُّوا أَمْرَهُمْ إِلَى عِيسَى فَقَالَ عِيسَى: أَمَّا وَجْبَتُهَا فَلَا يَعْلَمُ بِهَا أَحَدٌ إِلَّا اللهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ، وَفِيمَا عَهِدَ إِلَيَّ رَبِّي عَزَّ وَجَلَّ أَنَّ الدَّجَّالَ خَارِجٌ قَالَ وَمَعِي قَضِيبَانِ، فَإِذَا رَآنِي ذَابَ كَمَا يَذُوبُ الرَّصَاصُ، قَالَ: فَيُهْلِكُهُ اللهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ إِذَا رَآنِي حَتَّى إِنَّ الشَّجَرَ وَالْحَجَرَ يَقُولُ: يَا مُسْلِمُ إِنَّ تَحْتِي كَافِرًا فَتَعَالَ فَاقْتُلْهُ، قَالَ: فَيُهْلِكُهُمُ اللهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ ثُمَّ يَرْجِعُ النَّاسُ إِلَى بِلَادِهِمْ وَأَوْطَانِهِمْ،قَالَ: فَعِنْدَ ذَلِكَ يَخْرُجُ يَأْجُوجُ وَمَأْجُوجُ وَهُمْ مِنْ كُلِّ حَدَبٍ يَنْسِلُونَ، فَيَطَأُونَ بِلَادَهُمْ لَا يَأْتُون عَلَى شَيْءٍ إِلَّا أَهْلَكُوهُ وَلَا يَمُرُّونَ عَلَى مَاءٍ إِلَّا شَرِبُوه: قَالَ: ثُمَّ يَرْجِعُ النَّاسُ إِليَّ فَيَشْكُونَهُمْ فَأَدْعُو اللهَ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ عَلَيْهِمْ فَيُهْلِكُهُمْ وَيُمِيتُهُمْ حَتَّى تَجْوَى الْأَرْضُ مِنْ نَتْنِ رِيحِهِمْ أَيْ تُنْتِنُ، قَالَ: فَيُنْزِلُ اللهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ الْمَطَرَ فَيَجْتَرِفُ أَجْسَادَهُمْ حَتَّى يَقْذِفَهُمْ فِي الْبَحْرِ. قال يزيد بن هارون: ثُمَّ تُنْسَفُ الْجِبَالُ وَتُمَدُّ الْأَرْضُ مَدَّ الْأَدِيمِ، ثُمَّ رَجَعَ إِلَى حَدِيثِ هُشَيْمٍ، قَالَ: فَفِيمَا عَهِدَ إِلَيَّ رَبِّي عَزَّ وَجَلَّ أَنَّ ذَلِكَ إِذَا كَانَ كَذَلِكَ، فَإِنَّ السَّاعَةَ كَالْحَامِلِ المُتِمِّ لَا يَدْرِي أَهْلُهَا مَتَى تُفَاجِئُهُمْ بِوَلَادَتِهَا لَيْلًا أَوْ نَهَارًا»  (During the night of Isra', I met Ibrahim, Musa and `Isa. They mentioned the matter of the Last Hour, and they asked Ibrahim about it, who said, `I do not have knowledge of it.' They asked Musa about it and he said, `I have no knowledge of it.' They then asked `Isa about it, and he said, `As for when it will occur, only Allah, the Exalted and Most Honored, knows that. My Lord has conveyed to me that the Dajjal (False Messiah) will appear, and I will have two staffs (spears) with me. When he sees me, he will dissolve just as lead is dissolved. Allah will destroy him when he sees me, and the tree and the stone will say, `O Muslim! There is a disbeliever under (behind) me, so come and kill him.' Allah will destroy them (the Dajjal and his army), and the people will safely go back to their lands and areas. Thereafter, Gog and Magog will appear, and they will be swarming from every mound, sweeping over the earth and destroying everything they pass by. They will drink every water source they pass. The people will come to me complaining about Gog and Magog and will invoke Allah, the Exalted and Most Honored, against them, and Allah will bring death to all of them until the earth rots with their stinking odor. Allah will send down rain on them and the rain will carry their corpses, until it throws them in the sea... My Lord, the Exalted and Most Honored has conveyed to me that when this occurs, the Hour will be just like the pregnant women when the term of pregnancy is full, her family does not know when she will surprise them and give birth, whether by night or by day.) Ibn Majah also collected a similar Hadith Therefore these are the greatest of the Messengers but they did not have knowledge of the appointed term of the Hour. They asked `Isa about it and he spoke about its Signs, since he will descend in the last generations of this Ummah, implementing the Law of Allah's Messenger ﷺ, killing the Dajjal and destroying Gog and Magog people by the blessing of his supplication. `Isa merely informed them of the knowledge Allah gave him on this subject. Imam Ahmad recorded that Hudhayfah said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ was asked about the Hour and he said,  «عِلْمُهَا عِنْدَ رَبِّي عَزَّ وَجَلَّ لَا يُجَلِّيهَا لِوَقْتِهَا إِلَّا هُوَ، وَلَكِنْ سَأُخْبِرُكُمْ بِمَشَارِيطِهَا وَمَا يَكُونُ بَيْنَ يَدَيْهَا، إِنَّ بَيْنَ يَدَيْهَا فِتْنَةً وَهَرَجًا»  (Its knowledge is with my Lord, the Exalted and Most Honored, none can reveal its time except Him. However, I will tell you about its portents and the signs that precede it. Before it commences, there will be Fitnah (trials) and Harj.) They asked, `O Allah's Messenger! We know the meaning of the Fitnah, so what is the Harj' He said,  «بِلِسَانِ الْحَبَشَةِ الْقَتْل»  (It means killing, in the Language of the Ethiopians. ) He then said,  «وَيُلْقَى بَيْنَ النَّاسِ التَّنَاكُرُ، فَلَا يَكَادُ أَحَدٌ يَعْرِفُ أَحَدًا»  (Isolation and loneliness will be common between people, and therefore, almost no one will be able to recognize any other.)\" None among the collectors of the six Sunan collected this Hadith using this chain of narration. Tariq bin Shihab said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ kept mentioning the Last Hour for people kept asking about it, until this Ayah was revealed,  يَسْـَلُونَكَ عَنِ السَّاعَةِ أَيَّانَ مُرْسَـهَا  (They ask you about the Hour (Day of Resurrection): \"When will be its appointed time\"). An-Nasa'i collected this Hadith, which has a strong chain. Therefore, this unlettered Prophet , the chief of the Messengers ﷺ and their Seal, Muhammad, may Allah's peace and blessings be on him, Muhammad, the Prophet of mercy, repentance, Al-Malhmah (great demise of the disbelievers), Al-`Aqib (who came after many Prophets), Al-Muqaffi (the last of a succession) and Al-Hashir (below whom will all people be gathered on the Day of Gathering) Muhammad who said, as collected in the Sahih from Anas and Sahl bin Sa`d,  «بُعِثْتُ أَنَا وَالسَّاعَةَ كَهَاتَيْن»  (My sending and the Hour are like this,) and he joined his index and middle fingers. Yet, he was commanded to defer knowledge of the Last Hour to Allah if he was asked about it,  قُلْ إِنَّمَا عِلْمُهَا عِندَ اللَّهِ وَلَـكِنَّ أَكْثَرَ النَّاسِ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ  (Say: \"The knowledge thereof is with Allah (alone), but most of mankind know not.\") "
