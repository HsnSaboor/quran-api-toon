  27,26,"<h2>How the Hoopoe came before Sulayman and told Him about Saba'</h2> Allah says: ﴾فَمَكَثَ غَيْرَ بَعِيدٍ﴿ (But (the hoopoe) stayed not long,) meaning, he was absent for only a short time. Then he came and said to Sulayman: ﴾أَحَطتُ بِمَا لَمْ تُحِطْ بِهِ﴿ (I have grasped which you have not grasped) meaning, `I have come to know something that you and your troops do not know.' ﴾وَجِئْتُكَ مِن سَبَإٍ بِنَبَإٍ يَقِينٍ﴿ (and I have come to you from Saba' with true news.) meaning, with true and certain news. Saba' (Sheba) refers to Himyar, they were a dynasty in Yemen. Then the hoopoe said: ﴾إِنِّى وَجَدتُّ امْرَأَةً تَمْلِكُهُمْ﴿ (I found a woman ruling over them,) Al-Hasan Al-Basri said, \"This is Bilqis bint Sharahil, the queen of Saba'.\" Allah's saying: ﴾وَأُوتِيَتْ مِن كُلِّ شَىْءٍ﴿ (she has been given all things,) means, all the conveniences of this world that a powerful monarch could need. ﴾وَلَهَا عَرْشٌ عَظِيمٌ﴿ (and she has a great throne.) meaning, a tremendous chair adorned with gold and different kinds of jewels and pearls. The historians said, \"This throne was in a great, strong palace which was high and firmly constructed. In it there were three hundred and sixty windows on the east side, and a similar number on the west, and it was constructed in such a way that each day when the sun rose it would shine through one window, and when it set it would shine through the opposite window. And the people used to prostrate to the sun morning and evening. This is why the hoopoe said: ﴾وَجَدتُّهَا وَقَوْمَهَا يَسْجُدُونَ لِلشَّمْسِ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ وَزَيَّنَ لَهُمُ الشَّيْطَـنُ أَعْمَـلَهُمْ فَصَدَّهُمْ عَنِ السَّبِيلِ﴿ (I found her and her people worshipping the sun instead of Allah, and Shaytan has made their deeds fair seeming to them, and has prevented them from the way,) meaning, from the way of truth, ﴾فَهُمْ لاَ يَهْتَدُونَ﴿ (so they have no guidance.) Allah's saying: ﴾وَزَيَّنَ لَهُمُ الشَّيْطَـنُ أَعْمَـلَهُمْ فَصَدَّهُمْ عَنِ السَّبِيلِ فَهُمْ لاَ يَهْتَدُونَأَلاَّ يَسْجُدُواْ للَّهِ﴿ (and Shaytan has made their deeds fair seeming to them, and has prevented them from the way, so they have no guidance, so they do not prostrate themselves before Allah.) They do not know the way of truth, prostrating only before Allah alone and not before anything that He has created, whether heavenly bodies or anything else. This is like the Ayah: ﴾وَمِنْ ءَايَـتِهِ الَّيْلُ وَالنَّهَارُ وَالشَّمْسُ وَالْقَمَرُ لاَ تَسْجُدُواْ لِلشَّمْسِ وَلاَ لِلْقَمَرِ وَاسْجُدُواْ لِلَّهِ الَّذِى خَلَقَهُنَّ إِن كُنتُمْ إِيَّاهُ تَعْبُدُونَ ﴿ (And from among His signs are the night and the day, and the sun and the moon. Prostrate yourselves not to the sun nor to the moon, but prostrate yourselves to Allah Who created them, if you indeed worship Him.) (41:37) ﴾الَّذِى يُخْرِجُ الْخَبْءَ فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ﴿ (Who brings to light what is hidden in the heavens and the earth,) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas said: \"He knows everything that is hidden in the heavens and on earth.\" This was also the view of `Ikrimah, Mujahid, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Qatadah and others. His saying: ﴾وَيَعْلَمُ مَا تُخْفُونَ وَمَا تُعْلِنُونَ﴿ (and knows what you conceal and what you reveal.) means, He knows what His servants say and do in secret, and what they say and do openly. This is like the Ayah: ﴾سَوَآءٌ مِّنْكُمْ مَّنْ أَسَرَّ الْقَوْلَ وَمَنْ جَهَرَ بِهِ وَمَنْ هُوَ مُسْتَخْفٍ بِالَّيْلِ وَسَارِبٌ بِالنَّهَارِ ﴿ (It is the same whether any of you conceals his speech or declares it openly, whether he be hid by night or goes forth freely by day) (13:10). His saying: ﴾اللَّهُ لاَ إِلَـهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ رَبُّ الْعَرْشِ الْعَظِيمِ ﴿ (Allah, La ilaha illa Huwa, the Lord of the Supreme Throne!) means, He is the One to be called upon, Allah, He is the One other than Whom there is no god, the Lord of the Supreme Throne, and there is none greater than Him in all of creation. Since the hoopoe was calling to what is good, and for people to worship and prostrate to Allah alone, it would have been forbidden to kill him. Imam Ahmad, Abu Dawud and Ibn Majah recorded that Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, said that the Prophet forbade killing four kinds of animals: ants, bees, hoopoes and the sparrow hawks. Its chain of narration is Sahih. "

  27,31,"<h2>Sulayman's Letter to Bilqis</h2> Allah tells us what Sulayman said to the hoopoe when he told him about the people of Saba' and their queen: ﴾قَالَ سَنَنظُرُ أَصَدَقْتَ أَمْ كُنتَ مِنَ الْكَـذِبِينَ ﴿ ((Sulayman) said: \"We shall see whether you speak the truth or you are (one) of the liars.\") meaning, `are you telling the truth' ﴾أَمْ كُنتَ مِنَ الْكَـذِبِينَ﴿ (or you are (one) of the liars.) meaning, `or are you telling a lie in order to save yourself from the threat I made against you' ﴾اذْهَب بِّكِتَابِى هَـذَا فَأَلْقِهْ إِلَيْهِمْ ثُمَّ تَوَلَّ عَنْهُمْ فَانْظُرْ مَاذَا يَرْجِعُونَ ﴿ (Go you with this letter of mine and deliver it to them then draw back from them and see what they return.) Sulayman wrote a letter to Bilqis and her people and gave it to the hoopoe to deliver. It was said that he carried it on his wings, as is the way with birds, or that he carried it in his beak. He went to their land and found the palace of Bilqis, then he went to her private chambers and threw the letter through a small window, then he stepped to one side out of good manners. Bilqis was amazed and confused when she saw that, then she went and picked up the letter, opened its seal and read it. The letter said: ﴾إِنَّهُ مِن سُلَيْمَانَ وَإِنَّهُ بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ - أَلاَّ تَعْلُواْ عَلَىَّ وَأْتُونِى مُسْلِمِينَ ﴿ (it is from Sulayman, and it (reads): `In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful; Be you not exalted against me, but come to me submitting (as Muslims).') So she gathered her commanders and ministers and the leaders of her land, and said to them: ﴾يأَيُّهَا الْمَلأُ إِنَّى أُلْقِىَ إِلَىَّ كِتَابٌ كَرِيمٌ﴿ (\"O chiefs! Verily, here is delivered to me a noble letter.\") She described it as such because of the wondrous things she had seen, that it was delivered by a bird who threw it to her, then stood aside out of good manners. This was something that no king could do. Then she read the letter to them: ﴾إِنَّهُ مِن سُلَيْمَانَ وَإِنَّهُ بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ - أَلاَّ تَعْلُواْ عَلَىَّ وَأْتُونِى مُسْلِمِينَ ﴿ (Verily, it is from Sulayman, and it (reads): `In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful; Be you not exalted against me, but come to me submitting (as Muslims).') Thus they knew that it was from Allah's Prophet Sulayman, upon him be peace, and that they could not match him. This letter was the utmost in brevity and eloquence, coming straight to the point. ﴾أَلاَّ تَعْلُواْ عَلَىَّ﴿ (Be you not exalted against me,) Qatadah said: \"Do not be arrogant with me. ﴾وَأْتُونِى مُسْلِمِينَ﴿ (but come to me submitting (as Muslims). )\" `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam said: \"Do not refuse or be too arrogant to come to me ﴾وَأْتُونِى مُسْلِمِينَ﴿ (but come to me submitting (as Muslims).)\" "

  27,35,"<h2>Bilqis consults with Her Chiefs</h2> When she read Sulayman's letter to them and consulted with them about this news, she said: ﴾يأَيُّهَا الْمَلأ أَفْتُونِى فِى أَمْرِى مَا كُنتُ قَـطِعَةً أَمْراً حَتَّى تَشْهَدُونِ﴿ (\"O chiefs! Advise me in (this) case of mine. I decide no case till you are present with me.\") meaning, `until you come together and offer me your advice.' ﴾قَالُواْ نَحْنُ أُوْلُواْ قُوَّةٍ وَأُولُو بَأْسٍ شَدِيدٍ﴿ (They said: \"We have great strength, and great ability for war...\") They reminded her of their great numbers, preparedness and strength, then they referred the matter to her and said: ﴾وَالاٌّمْرُ إِلَيْكِ فَانظُرِى مَاذَا تَأْمُرِينَ﴿ (but it is for you to command; so think over what you will command.) meaning, `we have the power and strength, if you want to go to him and fight him.' The matter is yours to decide, so instruct us as you see fit and we will obey. Ibn `Abbas said: \"Bilqis said: ﴾إِنَّ الْمُلُوكَ إِذَا دَخَلُواْ قَرْيَةً أَفْسَدُوهَا وَجَعَلُواْ أَعِزَّةَ أَهْلِهَآ أَذِلَّةً﴿ (Verily, kings, when they enter a town, they destroy it and make the most honorable amongst its people the lowest.) And Allah said: ﴾وَكَذلِكَ يَفْعَلُونَ﴿ (And thus they do. ) Then she resorted to peaceful means, seeking a truce and trying to placate Sulayman, and said: ﴾وَإِنِّى مُرْسِلَةٌ إِلَيْهِمْ بِهَدِيَّةٍ فَنَاظِرَةٌ بِمَ يَرْجِعُ الْمُرْسَلُونَ ﴿ (But verily, I am going to send him a present, and see with what the messengers return.) meaning, `I will send him a gift befitting for one of his status, and will wait and see what his response will be. Perhaps he will accept that and leave us alone, or he will impose a tax which we can pay him every year, so that he will not fight us and wage war against us.' Qatadah said: \"May Allah have mercy on her and be pleased with her -- how wise she was as a Muslim and (before that) as an idolator! She understood how gift-giving has a good effect on people.\" Ibn `Abbas and others said: \"She said to her people, if he accepts the gift, he is a king, so fight him; but if he does not accept it, he is a Prophet, so follow him.\" "
