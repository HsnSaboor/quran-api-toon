  28,37,"<h2>Musa before Fir`awn and His People</h2> Allah tells us how Musa and his brother Harun came before Fir`awn and his chiefs, and showed them the clear miracles and overwhelming proof that Allah had given them to confirm the truth of what they were saying about Allah being One and that His commandments were to be followed. Fir`awn and his chiefs saw that with their own eyes and realized that it was certainly from Allah, but because of their disbelief and sin they resorted to stubbornness and false arguments. This was because they were too evil and arrogant to follow the truth. They said: ﴾مَا هَـذَآ إِلاَّ سِحْرٌ مُّفْتَرًى﴿ (This is nothing but invented magic.) meaning, fabricated and made up. They wanted to oppose him by means of their own tricks and their position and power, but this did not work. ﴾وَمَا سَمِعْنَا بِهَـذَا فِى ءَابَآئِنَا الاٌّوَّلِينَ﴿ (Never did we hear of this among our fathers of old.) They were referring worshipping Allah Alone, with no partner or associate. They said: \"We have never seen anyone among our forefathers following this religion; we have only ever seen people associating other gods in worship with Allah. Musa said in response to them: ﴾رَبِّى أَعْلَمُ بِمَن جَآءَ بِالْهُدَى مِنْ عِندِهِ﴿ (My Lord knows best him who came with guidance from Him,) meaning, `of me and you, and He will decide between me and you.' So he said: ﴾وَمَن تَكُونُ لَهُ عَـقِبَةُ الدَّارِ﴿ (and whose will be the happy end in the Hereafter. ) meaning, who will be supported and will prevail. ﴾إِنَّهُ لاَ يُفْلِحُ الظَّـلِمُونَ﴿ (Verily, the wrongdoers will not be successful.) refers to the idolators who associate others in worship with Allah.

  28,42,"<h2>The Arrogance of Fir`awn and His ultimate Destiny</h2> Allah tells us of Fir`awn's disbelief and wrongdoing, and how he falsely claimed divinity for his evil self, may Allah curse him. ﴾فَاسْتَخَفَّ قَوْمَهُ فَأَطَاعُوهُ﴿ (Thus he fooled his people, and they obeyed him.) 43:54 He called on his people to recognize his divinity, and they responded, because of their weak and foolish minds. So, he said: ﴾يأَيُّهَا الْملأ مَا عَلِمْتُ لَكُمْ مِّنْ إِلَـهٍ غَيْرِى﴿ (O chiefs! I know not that you have a god other than me.) Allah tells us about Fir`awn: ﴾فَحَشَرَ فَنَادَى - فَقَالَ أَنَاْ رَبُّكُمُ الاٌّعْلَى - فَأَخَذَهُ اللَّهُ نَكَالَ الاٌّخِرَةِ وَالاٍّوْلَى - إِنَّ فِى ذَلِكَ لَعِبْرَةً لِّمَن يَخْشَى ﴿ (Then he gathered (his people) and cried aloud, saying: \"I am your lord, most high.\" So Allah, seized him with punishment for his last and first transgression. Verily, in this is an instructive admonition for whosoever fears Allah.) (79:23-26) meaning: he brought his people together and called to them in a loud voice, shouting that, and they responded to him obediently. So Allah took revenge on him, and made him a lesson to others in this world and the Hereafter. He even confronted Musa with that, and said: ﴾لَئِنِ اتَّخَذْتَ إِلَـهَاً غَيْرِى لأَجْعَلَنَّكَ مِنَ الْمَسْجُونِينَ﴿ (If you choose a god other than me, I will certainly put you among the prisoners) (26:29). ﴾فَأَوْقِدْ لِى يَهَـمَـنُ عَلَى الطِّينِ فَاجْعَل لِّى صَرْحاً لَّعَلِّى أَطَّلِعُ إِلَى إِلَـهِ مُوسَى﴿ (So kindle for me (a fire), O Haman, to bake (bricks out of) clay, and set up for me a Sarh in order that I may look at the God of Musa;) He commanded his minister and adviser Haman to bake bricks for him, i.e., to make bricks in order to build a Sarh, a exalted towering palace. This is like the Ayah, ﴾وَقَالَ فَرْعَوْنُ يهَـمَـنُ ابْنِ لِى صَرْحاً لَّعَـلِّى أَبْلُغُ الاٌّسْبَـبَ - أَسْبَـبَ السَّمَـوَتِ فَأَطَّلِعَ إِلَى إِلَـهِ مُوسَى وَإِنِّى لاّظُنُّهُ كَـذِباً وَكَـذَلِكَ زُيِّنَ لِفِرْعَوْنَ سُوءُ عَمَلِهِ وَصُدَّ عَنِ السَّبِيلِ وَمَا كَـيْدُ فِرْعَوْنَ إِلاَّ فِى تَبَابٍ ﴿ (And Fir`awn said: \"O Haman! Build me a Sarh that I may arrive at the ways -- the ways of the heavens, and I may look upon the God of Musa, but verily, I think him to be a liar.\" Thus it was made fair seeming, in Fir`awn's eyes, the evil of his deeds, and he was hindered from the path; and the plot of Fir`awn led to nothing but loss and destruction) (40:36-37). Fir`awn built this tower, which was the highest structure ever seen on earth, because he wanted to show his people that Musa was lying when he claimed that there was a God other than Fir`awn. Fir`awn said: ﴾وَإِنِّى لأَظُنُّهُ مِنَ الْكَـذِبِينَ﴿ (and verily, I think that he (Musa) is one of the liars.) meaning, `when he says that there is a lord other than me.' The issue was not whether Allah had sent Musa, because he did not acknowledge the existence of the Creator in the first place. On the contrary, he said: ﴾وَمَا رَبُّ الْعَـلَمِينَ﴿ (And what is the Lord of Al-`Alamin) (26:23) and: ﴾لَئِنِ اتَّخَذْتَ إِلَـهَاً غَيْرِى لأَجْعَلَنَّكَ مِنَ الْمَسْجُونِينَ﴿ (If you choose a god other than me, I will certainly put you among the prisoners.) (26:29) and he said: ﴾يأَيُّهَا الْملأ مَا عَلِمْتُ لَكُمْ مِّنْ إِلَـهٍ غَيْرِى﴿ (O chiefs! I know not that you have a god other than me.) This was the view of Ibn Jarir. ﴾وَاسْتَكْبَرَ هُوَ وَجُنُودُهُ فِى الاٌّرْضِ بِغَيْرِ الْحَقِّ وَظَنُّواْ أَنَّهُمْ إِلَيْنَا لاَ يُرْجَعُونَ ﴿ (And he and his armies were arrogant in the land, without right, and they thought that they would never return to Us.) means, they were arrogant oppressors who spread much mischief in the land, and they believed that there would be no Resurrection. ﴾فَصَبَّ عَلَيْهِمْ رَبُّكَ سَوْطَ عَذَابٍ - إِنَّ رَبَّكَ لَبِالْمِرْصَادِ ﴿ (So, your Lord poured on them different kinds of severe torment. Verily, your Lord is Ever Watchful (over them).) (89:13-14). Allah says here: ﴾فَأَخَذْنَـهُ وَجُنُودَهُ فَنَبَذْنَـهُمْ فِى الْيَمِّ﴿ (So, We seized him and his armies, and We threw them all into the sea.) meaning, `We drowned them in the sea in a single morning, and not one of them was left.' ﴾فَانظُرْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَـقِبَةُ الظَّـلِمِينَوَجَعَلْنَـهُمْ أَئِمَّةً يَدْعُونَ إِلَى النَّارِ﴿ (So, behold what was the end of the wrongdoers. And We made them leaders inviting to the Fire) for those who followed them and took the same path as they did, rejecting the Messengers and denying the Creator. ﴾وَيَوْمَ الْقِيـمَةِ لاَ يُنصَرُونَ﴿ (and on the Day of Resurrection, they will not be helped.) their humiliation in this world is combined with and connected to their humiliation in the Hereafter, as Allah says: ﴾أَهْلَكْنَـهُمْ فَلاَ نَـصِرَ لَهُمْ﴿ (We have destroyed them. And there was none to help them) (47:13). ﴾وَأَتْبَعْنَـهُم فِى هَذِهِ الدُّنْيَا لَعْنَةً﴿ (And We made a curse to follow them in this world,) Allah decreed that they and their king Fir`awn should be cursed by the believers among His servants who follow His Messengers, just as in this world they were cursed by the Prophets and their followers. ﴾وَيَوْمَ القِيَـمَةِ هُمْ مِّنَ الْمَقْبُوحِينَ﴿ (and on the Day of Resurrection, they will be among disgraced.) Qatadah said, \"This Ayah is like the Ayah, ﴾وَأُتْبِعُواْ فِى هَـذِهِ لَعْنَةً وَيَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ بِئْسَ الرِّفْدُ الْمَرْفُودُ ﴿ (They were pursued by a curse in this (life) and on the Day of Resurrection. Evil indeed is the gift given.) (11:99).\" "
  28,43,"<h2>The Blessings which Allah bestowed upon Musa</h2> Allah tells us about the blessings which He gave His servant and Messenger Musa, the speaker, may the best of peace and blessings from his Lord be upon him, He revealed the Tawrah to him after He destroyed Fir`awn and his chiefs. ﴾مِن بَعْدِ مَآ أَهْلَكْنَا الْقُرُونَ الاٍّولَى﴿ (after We had destroyed the generations of old) After the revelation of the Tawrah, no nation would again be punished with an overwhelming calamity; instead the believers were now commanded to fight the enemies of Allah among the idolators, as Allah says: ﴾وَجَآءَ فِرْعَوْنُ وَمَن قَبْلَهُ وَالْمُؤْتَفِكَـتُ بِالْخَاطِئَةِ - فَعَصَوْاْ رَسُولَ رَبِّهِمْ فَأَخَذَهُمْ أَخْذَةً رَّابِيَةً ﴿ (And Fir`awn, and those before him, and the cities overthrown committed sin. And they disobeyed their Lord's Messenger, so He seized them with a strong punishment) (69:9-10). ﴾بَصَآئِرَ لِلنَّاسِ وَهُدًى وَرَحْمَةً﴿ (as an enlightenment for mankind, and a guidance and a mercy,) guidance from blindness and error. A guidance to the truth and a mercy means, to show the way towards doing righteous deeds. ﴾لَعَلَّهُمْ يَتَذَكَّرُونَ﴿ (that they might remember.) means, that the people might be reminded and guided by it.
