  22,40,"<h2>Permission to fight; this is the first Ayah of Jihad</h2> Al-`Awfi reported that Ibn `Abbas said, \"This was revealed about Muhammad ﷺ and his Companions, when they were expelled from Makkah.\" Mujahid, Ad-Dahhak and others among the Salaf, such as Ibn `Abbas, `Urwah bin Az-Zubayr, Zayd bin Aslam, Muqatil bin Hayan, Qatadah and others said, \"This is the first Ayah which was revealed about Jihad.\" Ibn Jarir recorded that Ibn `Abbas said, \"When the Prophet was driven out of Makkah, Abu Bakr said, `They have their Prophet. Truly, to Allah we belong and truly, to Him we shall return; surely they are doomed.\"' Ibn `Abbas said, \"Then Allah revealed the words:  أُذِنَ لِلَّذِينَ يُقَـتَلُونَ بِأَنَّهُمْ ظُلِمُواْ وَإِنَّ اللَّهَ عَلَى نَصْرِهِمْ لَقَدِيرٌ  (Permission (to fight) is given to those (believers) fought against, because they have been wronged; and surely, Allah is able to give them victory.)\" Abu Bakr, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"Then I knew that there would be fighting.\" Imam Ahmad added: \"Ibn `Abbas said, `This was the first Ayah to be revealed concerning fighting.\"' This was also recorded by At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa'i in the Book of Tafsir of their Sunans. At-Tirmidhi said: \"It is a Hasan Hadith.\"  وَإِنَّ اللَّهَ عَلَى نَصْرِهِمْ لَقَدِيرٌ  (and surely, Allah is able to give them victory.) means, He is able to grant victory to His believing servants without any fighting taking place, but He wants His servants to strive their utmost in obeying Him, as He says:  فَإِذَا لَقِيتُمُ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ فَضَرْبَ الرِّقَابِ حَتَّى إِذَآ أَثْخَنتُمُوهُمْ فَشُدُّواْ الْوَثَاقَ فَإِمَّا مَنًّا بَعْدُ وَإِمَّا فِدَآءً حَتَّى تَضَعَ الْحَرْبُ أَوْزَارَهَا ذَلِكَ وَلَوْ يَشَآءُ اللَّهُ لاَنْتَصَرَ مِنْهُمْ وَلَـكِن لِّيَبْلُوَ بَعْضَكُمْ بِبَعْضٍ وَالَّذِينَ قُتِلُواْ فِى سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ فَلَن يُضِلَّ أَعْمَـلَهُمْ - سَيَهْدِيهِمْ وَيُصْلِحُ بَالَهُمْ - وَيُدْخِلُهُمُ الْجَنَّةَ عَرَّفَهَا لَهُمْ  (So, when you meet those who disbelieve, strike necks till when you have killed and wounded many of them, then bind a bond firmly. Thereafter either for generosity, or ransom, until war lays down its burden. Thus, but if it had been Allah's will, He Himself could certainly have punished them. But (He lets you fight) in order to test some of you with others. But those who are killed in the way of Allah, He will never let their deeds be lost. He will guide them and set right their state. And admit them to Paradise which He has made known to them.) 47:4-6  قَـتِلُوهُمْ يُعَذِّبْهُمُ اللَّهُ بِأَيْدِيكُمْ وَيُخْزِهِمْ وَيَنْصُرْكُمْ عَلَيْهِمْ وَيَشْفِ صُدُورَ قَوْمٍ مُّؤْمِنِينَ - وَيُذْهِبْ غَيْظَ قُلُوبِهِمْ وَيَتُوبُ اللَّهُ عَلَى مَن يَشَآءُ وَاللَّهُ عَلِيمٌ حَكِيمٌ  (Fight against them so that Allah will punish them by your hands, and disgrace them, and give you victory over them, and heal the breasts of a believing people, and remove the anger of their (believers') hearts. Allah accepts the repentance of whom He wills. Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.) 9:14-15  وَلَنَبْلُوَنَّكُمْ حَتَّى نَعْلَمَ الْمُجَـهِدِينَ مِنكُمْ وَالصَّـبِرِينَ وَنَبْلُوَ أَخْبَـرَكُمْ  (And surely, We shall try you till We test those who strive hard and the patient, and We shall test your facts.) 47:31. And there are many similar Ayat. Ibn `Abbas commented on the Ayah,  وَإِنَّ اللَّهَ عَلَى نَصْرِهِمْ لَقَدِيرٌ  (and surely, Allah is able to give them (believers) victory.) \"And this is what He did.\" Allah prescribed Jihad at an appropriate time, because when they were in Makkah, the idolators outnumbered them by more than ten to one. Were they to engage in fighting at that time, the results would have been disastrous. When the idolators went to extremes to persecute Muslims, to expel the Prophet and resolving to kill him; when they sent his Companions into exile here and there, so that some went to Ethiopia and others went to Al-Madinah; when they settled in Al-Madinah and the Messenger of Allah ﷺ joined them there, and they gathered around him and lent him their support, and they had a place where Islam prevailed, and a stronghold to which they could retreat; then Allah prescribed Jihad against the enemy, and this was the first Ayah to be revealed for it. Allah said:  أُذِنَ لِلَّذِينَ يُقَـتَلُونَ بِأَنَّهُمْ ظُلِمُواْ وَإِنَّ اللَّهَ عَلَى نَصْرِهِمْ لَقَدِيرٌ الَّذِينَ أُخْرِجُواْ مِن دِيَـرِهِم بِغَيْرِ حَقٍّ  (Permission (to fight) is given to those fought against, because they have been wronged; and surely, Allah is able to give them victory. Those who have been expelled from their homes unjustly) Al-`Awfi reported that Ibn `Abbas said; \"They were driven out of Makkah to Al-Madinah unjustly, i.e., Muhammad ﷺ and his Companions.\"  إِلاَّ أَن يَقُولُواْ رَبُّنَا اللَّهُ  (only because they said: \"Our Lord is Allah.\") means, they had not done anything to their people or committed any wrongs against them, apart from the fact that they believed in the Oneness of Allah and they worshipped Him Alone, with no partner or associate. But for the idolators, this was the worst of sins, as Allah says:  يُخْرِجُونَ الرَّسُولَ وَإِيَّـكُمْ أَن تُؤْمِنُواْ بِاللَّهِ رَبِّكُمْ  (and have driven out the Messenger and yourselves because you believe in Allah, your Lord!) 60:1. Then Allah says:  وَلَوْلاَ دَفْعُ اللَّهِ النَّاسَ بَعْضَهُم بِبَعْضٍ  (For had it not been that Allah checks one set of people by means of another,) meaning, were it not for the fact that He repels one people by means of another, and restrains the evil of people towards others by means of whatever circumstances He creates and decrees, the earth would have been corrupted and the strong would have destroyed the weak.  لَّهُدِّمَتْ صَوَمِعُ  (Sawami` surely have been pulled down) means the small temples used by monks. This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Abu Al-`Aliyah, `Ikrimah, Ad-Dahhak and others. Qatadah said, \"This refers to the places of worship of the Sabians;\" according to another report, he said, \"The Sawami` of the Zoroastrians.\" Muqatil bin Hayyan said, \"These are houses along the roads.\"  وَبِيَعٌ  (Biya`.) These are larger than the Sawami` and accommodate more worshippers; the Christians also have these. This was the view of Abu Al-`Aliyah, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak, Ibn Sakhr, Muqatil bin Hayyan, Khusayf and others. Ibn Jubayr reported from Mujahid and others that this referred to the synagogues of the Jews which are known to them as Salut. And Allah knows best.  وَصَلَوَتِ  (Salawat) Al-`Awfi reported that Ibn `Abbas said, \"Salawat means churches.\" `Ikrimah, Ad-Dahhak and Qatadah said that it referred to the synagogues of the Jews. Abu Al-`Aliyah and others said, \"Salawat refers to the places of worship of the Sabians.\" Ibn Abi Najih reported that Mujahid said, \"Salawat refers to places of worship of the People of the Book and of the people of Islam along the roads.\" Masjids belong to the Muslims.  يُذْكَرُ فِيهَا اسمُ اللَّهِ كَثِيراً  (wherein the Name of Allah is mentioned much,) It was said that the pronoun refers to Masjids, because this is the closest of the words mentioned. Ad-Dahhak said, \"In all of them the Name of Allah is often mentioned.\" Ibn Jarir said, \"The correct view is that the monasteries of the monks, the churches of the Christians, the synagogues of the Jews and the Masjids of the Muslims, in which the Name of Allah is mentioned much, would have been destroyed -- because this is the usual usage in Arabic.\" Some of the scholars said, \"This is a sequence listing the smallest to the greatest, because the Masjids are more frequented by more worshippers who have the correct intention and way.\"  وَلَيَنصُرَنَّ اللَّهُ مَن يَنصُرُهُ  (Verily, Allah will help those who help His (cause).) This is like the Ayah:  يأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ إِن تَنصُرُواْ اللَّهَ يَنصُرْكُمْ وَيُثَبِّتْ أَقْدَامَكُمْ - وَالَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ فَتَعْساً لَّهُمْ وَأَضَلَّ أَعْمَـلَهُمْ  (O you who believe! If you help (in the cause of) Allah, He will help you, and make your foothold firm. But those who disbelieve, for them is destruction, and (Allah) will make their deeds vain.) 47:7-8  إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَقَوِىٌّ عَزِيزٌ  (Truly, Allah is All-Strong, All-Mighty.) Allah describes Himself as being All-Strong and All-Mighty. By His strength He created everything and measured it exactly according to its due measurements; by His might nothing can overpower Him or overwhelm Him, rather everything is humbled before Him and is in need of Him. Whoever is supported by the All-Strong, the All-Mighty, is indeed supported and helped, and his enemy will be overpowered. Allah says:  وَلَقَدْ سَبَقَتْ كَلِمَتُنَا لِعِبَادِنَا الْمُرْسَلِينَ - إِنَّهُمْ لَهُمُ الْمَنصُورُونَ - وَإِنَّ جُندَنَا لَهُمُ الْغَـلِبُونَ  (And, verily, Our Word has gone forth of old for Our servants, the Messengers, that they verily, would be made triumphant, and that Our soldiers! They verily, would be the victors.) 37:171-173  كَتَبَ اللَّهُ لاّغْلِبَنَّ أَنَاْ وَرُسُلِى إِنَّ اللَّهَ قَوِىٌّ عَزِيزٌ  (Allah has decreed: \"Verily, it is I and My Messengers who shall be the victorious.\" Verily, Allah is All-Powerful, All-Mighty.) 58:21 "
  22,41,"<h2>The Duties of the Muslims when They attain Power</h2> Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `Uthman bin `Affan said, \"The Ayah:  الَّذِينَ إِنْ مَّكَّنَّـهُمْ فِى الاٌّرْضِ أَقَامُواْ الصَّلَوةَ وَآتَوُاْ الزَّكَـوةَ وَأَمَرُواْ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ وَنَهَوْاْ عَنِ الْمُنْكَرِ  (Those who, if We give them power in the land, (they) establish the Salah, enforce the Zakah, and they enjoin the good and forbid the evil.) was revealed concerning us, for we had been expelled from our homes unjustly only because we said: `Our Lord is Allah.' Then we were given power in the land, so we established regular prayer, paid the Zakah, enjoined what is good and forbade what is evil, and with Allah rests the end of (all) matters. This is about my companions and I.\" Abu Al-`Aliyah said, \"They were the Companions of Muhammad ﷺ.\" As-Sabah bin Suwadah Al-Kindi said, \"I heard `Umar bin `Abdul-`Aziz give a speech and say:  الَّذِينَ إِنْ مَّكَّنَّـهُمْ فِى الاٌّرْضِ  (Those who, if We give them power in the land....) Then he said, \"This is not obligatory only for those who are in authority, it also applies to those who are governed by them. Shall I not tell you what you can expect from your governor, and what duties those who are ruled owe to him Your rights over your governor are that he should check on you with regard to your duties towards Allah and restore the rights that you have over one another, and that he should guide you to the straight path as much as possible. Your duties towards him are that you should obey him without cheating and without resentment, and you should obey him both in secret and openly.\" `Atiyah Al-`Awfi said, \"This Ayah is like the Ayah:  وَعَدَ اللَّهُ الَّذِينَ ءامَنُواْ مِنْكُمْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّـلِحَاتِ لَيَسْتَخْلِفَنَّهُمْ فِى الاْرْضِ  (Allah has promised those among you who believe and do righteous good deeds, that He will certainly grant them succession to (the present rulers) in the land) 24:55.  وَلِلَّهِ عَـقِبَةُ الاٍّمُورِ  (And with Allah rests the end of (all) matters.) This is like the Ayah:  وَالْعَـقِبَةُ لِلْمُتَّقِينَ  (And the good end is for those who have Taqwa) 28:83. Zayd bin Aslam said:  وَلِلَّهِ عَـقِبَةُ الاٍّمُورِ  (And with Allah rests the end of (all) matters.) \"And with Allah will be the reward for what they did.\" "

  22,46,"<h2>The Consequences for the Disbelievers</h2> Here Allah consoles His Prophet Muhammad ﷺ for the disbelief of those among his people who opposed him.  وَإِن يُكَذِّبُوكَ فَقَدْ كَذَّبَتْ قَبْلَهُمْ قَوْمُ نُوحٍ  (And if they deny you, so did deny before them the people of Nuh) until His saying,  وَكُذِّبَ مُوسَى  (and denied was Musa.) means, despite all the clear signs and evidence that they brought.  فَأمْلَيْتُ لِلْكَـفِرِينَ  (But I granted respite to the disbelievers for a while,) means, `I delayed and postponed.'  ثُمَّ أَخَذْتُهُمْ فَكَيْفَ كَانَ نَكِيرِ  (then I seized them, and how (terrible) was My punishment!) means, `how great was My vengeance against them and My punishment of them!' In the Two Sahihs it is reported from Abu Musa that the Prophet said:  «إِنَّ اللهَ لَيُمْلِي لِلظَّالِمِ حَتَّى إِذَا أَخَذَهُ لَمْ يُفْلِتْه»  (Allah lets the wrongdoer carry on until, when He seizes him, He will never let him go.) Then he recited:  وَكَذلِكَ أَخْذُ رَبِّكَ إِذَا أَخَذَ الْقُرَى وَهِىَ ظَـلِمَةٌ إِنَّ أَخْذَهُ أَلِيمٌ شَدِيدٌ  (Such is the punishment of your Lord when He seizes the towns while they are doing wrong. Verily, His punishment is painful (and) severe.) 11:102 Then Allah says:  فَكَأَيِّن مِّن قَرْيَةٍ أَهْلَكْنَـهَا  (And many a township did We destroy)  وَهِىَ ظَـلِمَةٌ  (while they were given wrongdoing,) meaning, they were rejecting their Messengers.  فَهِىَ خَاوِيَةٌ عَلَى عُرُوشِهَا  (so that it lie in ruins,) Ad-Dahhak said, \"Leveled to their roofs,\" i.e., their houses and cities were destroyed.  وَبِئْرٍ مُّعَطَّلَةٍ  (and (many) a deserted well) means, they draw no water from it, and no one comes to it, after it had been frequented often by crowds of people.  وَقَصْرٍ مَّشِيدٍ  (and a castle Mashid!) `Ikrimah said, \"This means whitened with plaster.\" Something similar was narrated from `Ali bin Abi Talib, Mujahid, `Ata', Sa`id bin Jubayr, Abu Al-Mulayh and Ad-Dahhak. Others said that it means high and impenetrable fortresses. All of these suggestions are close in meaning and do not contradict one another, for this sturdy construction and great height did not help their occupants or afford them any protection when the punishment of Allah came upon them, as He says:  أَيْنَمَا تَكُونُواْ يُدْرِككُّمُ الْمَوْتُ وَلَوْ كُنتُمْ فِى بُرُوجٍ مُّشَيَّدَةٍ  (\"Wheresoever you may be, death will overtake you even if you are in Buruj Mushayyadah!\") 4:78  أَفَلَمْ يَسِيرُواْ فِى الاٌّرْضِ  (Have they not traveled through the land,) means, have they not traveled in the physical sense and also used their minds to ponder That is sufficient, as Ibn Abi Ad-Dunya said in his book At-Tafakkur wal-I`tibar, \"Some of the wise people said, `Give life to your heart with lessons, illuminate it with thought, kill it with asceticism, strengthen it with certain faith, remind it of its mortality, make it aware of the calamities of this world, warn it of the disasters that life may bring, show it how things may suddenly change with the passing of days, tell it the stories of the people of the past, and remind it what happened to those who came before.\"' Walk through their ruins, see what they did and what became of them, meaning, look at the punishments and divine wrath that struck the nations of the past who belied,  فَتَكُونَ لَهُمْ قُلُوبٌ يَعْقِلُونَ بِهَآ أَوْ ءَاذَانٌ يَسْمَعُونَ بِهَا  (and have they hearts wherewith to understand and ears wherewith to hear) meaning, let them learn a lesson from that.  فَإِنَّهَا لاَ تَعْمَى الاٌّبْصَـرُ وَلَـكِن تَعْمَى الْقُلُوبُ الَّتِى فِى الصُّدُورِ  (Verily, it is not the eyes that grow blind, but it is the hearts which are in the breasts that grow blind.) means, the blind person is not the one whose eyes cannot see, but rather the one who has no insight. Even if the physical eyes are sound, they still cannot learn the lesson. "
