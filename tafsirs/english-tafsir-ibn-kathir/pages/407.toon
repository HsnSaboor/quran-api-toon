tafsir[8]{c,v,t}:
  30,25,"﴾وَمِنْ ءَايَـتِهِ﴿ (And among His signs) which speak of His greatness, ﴾يُرِيكُمُ الْبَرْقَ خَوْفاً وَطَمَعاً﴿ (He shows you the lightning, for fear and for hope,) Sometimes you fear the heavy rain and destructive thunderbolts that follow it, and sometimes you feel hope, when you see a flash of lightning, that much-needed rain will come. Allah says: ﴾وَيُنَزِّلُ مِنَ السَّمَآءِ مَآءً فَيُحْىِ بِهِ الاٌّرْضَ بَعْدَ مَوْتِهَا﴿ (and He sends down water from the sky, and therewith revives the earth after its death.) After it was barren, with nothing growing there, then the water comes to it and ﴾اهْتَزَّتْ وَرَبَتْ وَأَنبَتَتْ مِن كُلِّ زَوْجٍ بَهِيجٍ﴿ (it is stirred, and it swells and puts forth every lovely kind (of growth).) (22:5). In this is a clear sign and proof of the resurrection and the coming of the Hour. Allah says: ﴾إِنَّ فِى ذلِكَ لآيَـتٍ لِّقَوْمٍ يَعْقِلُونَ﴿ (Verily, in that are indeed signs for a people who understand.) Then Allah says: ﴾وَمِنْ ءَايَـتِهِ أَن تَقُومَ السَّمَآءُ وَالاٌّرْضُ بِأَمْرِهِ﴿ (And among His signs is that the heaven and the earth stand by His command.) This is like the Ayat: ﴾وَيُمْسِكُ السَّمَآءَ أَن تَقَعَ عَلَى الاٌّرْضِ إِلاَّ بِإِذْنِهِ﴿ (He withholds the heaven from falling on the earth except by His leave) (22: 65). ﴾إِنَّ اللَّهَ يُمْسِكُ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضَ أَن تَزُولاَ﴿ (Verily, Allah grasps the heavens and the earth lest they should move away from their places) (35:41). Whenever `Umar bin Al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him, swore an emphatic oath, he would say, \"No, by the One by Whose command the heaven and the earth stand,\" i.e., they stand firm by His command to them and His subjugation of them. Then, when the Day of Resurrection comes, the Day when the earth will be exchanged with another earth and the dead will come forth from their graves, brought back to life by His command and His call to them, ﴾ثُمَّ إِذَا دَعَاكُمْ دَعْوَةً مِّنَ الاٌّرْضِ إِذَآ أَنتُمْ تَخْرُجُونَ﴿ (Then afterwards when He will call you by a single call, behold, you will come out from the earth.) This is like the Ayat: ﴾يَوْمَ يَدْعُوكُمْ فَتَسْتَجِيبُونَ بِحَمْدِهِ وَتَظُنُّونَ إِن لَّبِثْتُمْ إِلاَّ قَلِيلاً ﴿ (On the Day when He will call you, and you will answer with His praise and obedience, and you will think that you have stayed but a little while!) (17:52) ﴾فَإِنَّمَا هِىَ زَجْرَةٌ وَحِدَةٌ - فَإِذَا هُم بِالسَّاهِرَةِ ﴿ (But it will be only a single Zajrah. When behold, they find themselves on the surface of the earth alive after their death. ) (79:13-14), and ﴾إِن كَانَتْ إِلاَّ صَيْحَةً وَحِدَةً فَإِذَا هُمْ جَمِيعٌ لَّدَيْنَا مُحْضَرُونَ ﴿ (It will be but a single Sayhah, so behold they will all be brought up before Us!) (36:53). "

  30,27,"﴾وَلَهُ مَن فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ﴿ (To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth.) means, He owns it and it is enslaved to Him. ﴾كُلٌّ لَّهُ قَـنِتُونَ﴿ (All are obedient to Him.) they are humble before Him and submit to Him, whether willingly or unwillingly. <h2>Repeating the Creation is easier for Allah</h2> Allah's saying: ﴾وَهُوَ الَّذِى يَبْدَأُ الْخَلْقَ ثُمَّ يُعِيدُهُ وَهُوَ أَهْوَنُ عَلَيْهِ﴿ (And He it is Who originates the creation, then He will repeat it; and this is easier for Him.) Ibn Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas said, \"This means it is easier for Him.\" Mujahid said: \"Repeating it is easier for Him than originating it, and originating it is easy for Him.\" This was also the view of `Ikrimah and others. Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, said that the Prophet said: ﴾«قَالَ اللهُ: كَذَّبَنِي ابْنُ آدَمَ وَلَمْ يَكُنْ لَهُ ذَلِكَ، وَشَتَمَنِي وَلَمْ يَكُنْ لَهُ ذَلِكَ، فَأَمَّا تَكْذِيبُهُ إِيَّايَ فَقَوْلُهُ: لَنْ يُعِيدَنِي كَمَا بَدَأَنِي وَلَيْسَ أَوَّلُ الْخَلْقِ بِأَهْوَنَ عَلَيَّ مِنْ إِعَادَتِهِ، وَأَمَّا شَتْمُهُ إِيَّايَ فَقَوْلُهُ: اتَّخَذَ اللهُ وَلَدًا، وَأَنَا الْأَحَدُ الصَّمَدُ الَّذِي لَمْ يَلِدْ وَلَمْ يُولَدْ وَلَمْ يَكُنْ لَهُ كُفُوًا أَحَد»﴿ (Allah says; \"The son of Adam denied Me, and he had no right to do so. And he reviled Me, and he had no right to do so. As for his denying Me, it is his saying: `He will not remake me as He originated me' -- while originating the creation is not easier for Me than re-creating him. As for his reviling Me, it is his saying: `Allah has taken to Himself a son,' while I am the One, the Self-Sufficient Master; I beget not, nor was I begotten, and there is none comparable to Me.\") This was recorded only by Al-Bukhari. ﴾وَلَهُ الْمَثَلُ الأَعْلَى فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ﴿ (His is the highest description in the heavens and in the earth. ) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported Ibn `Abbas said, \"This is like the Ayah: ﴾لَيْسَ كَمِثْلِهِ شَىْءٌ﴿ (There is nothing like Him) (42:11).\" Qatadah said: \"His description is La ilaha illallah, and there is no Lord but He.\" "

  30,29,"<h2>A Parable of Tawhid</h2> This is the parable Allah makes of the idolators, those who worship others besides Him and attribute partners to Him, while at the same time admitting that these so-called partners -- idols and false gods -- are enslaved to and belong to Him. In their Talbiyah (during Hajj and `Umrah they used to say, \"At Your service, You have no partner except the partner that You have, You own Him and whatever he owns.\" ﴾ضَرَبَ لَكُمْ مَّثَلاً مِّنْ أَنفُسِكُمْ﴿ (He sets forth for you a parable from yourselves) `something which you yourselves can see witness, and understand.' ﴾هَلْ لَّكُمْ مِّن مَّا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَـنُكُمْ مِّن شُرَكَآءَ فِى مَا رَزَقْنَـكُمْ فَأَنتُمْ فِيهِ سَوَآءٌ﴿ (Do you have partners among those whom your right hands possess to share as equals in the wealth We have bestowed on you...) `None of you would like to have his servant as a partner in his wealth, each of them having an equal share.' ﴾تَخَافُونَهُمْ كَخِيفَتِكُمْ أَنفُسَكُمْ﴿ (whom you fear as you fear each other.) `You fear that they will have a share in your wealth with you.' Abu Mijlaz said, \"You do not fear that your servant will have a share in your wealth, because he has no such right; similarly, Allah has no partner.\" The point is, that since any one of you would abhor such a thing, how can you attribute rivals to Allah from among His creation At-Tabarani recorded that Ibn `Abbas said, \"The people of Shirk used to say in their Talbiyah, `At Your service, You have no partner except the partner that You have, You own Him and whatever he owns.' Then Allah revealed the words: ﴾هَلْ لَّكُمْ مِّن مَّا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَـنُكُمْ مِّن شُرَكَآءَ فِى مَا رَزَقْنَـكُمْ فَأَنتُمْ فِيهِ سَوَآءٌ تَخَافُونَهُمْ كَخِيفَتِكُمْ أَنفُسَكُمْ﴿ (Do you have partners among those whom your right hands possess to share as equals in the wealth We have bestowed on you, whom you fear as you fear each other)\" If humans have this characteristic, this parable shows that it is even less befitting for Allah to have a partner. ﴾كَذَلِكَ نُفَصِّلُ الاٌّيَـتِ لِقَوْمٍ يَعْقِلُونَ﴿ (Thus do We explain the signs in detail to a people who have sense.) Then Allah points out that when the idolators worship others instead of Him, doing so out of their own folly and ignorance: ﴾بَلِ اتَّبَعَ الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ﴿ (Nay, but those who do wrong follow...), meaning, the idolators, ﴾أَهْوَاءَهُمْ﴿ (...their own lusts) means, in their worship of false gods without knowledge. ﴾فَمَن يَهْدِى مَنْ أَضَلَّ اللَّهُ﴿ (Then who will guide him whom Allah has sent astray) means, no one can guide them if Allah has decreed that they will be misguided. ﴾وَمَا لَهُم مِّن نَّـصِرِينَ﴿ (And for such there will be no helpers.) means, there is no one who can save them from the power of Allah or grant them a way out, for what He wills, happens and what He does not will, does not happen.

  30,32,"<h2>The Command to adhere to Tawhid</h2> Allah says: `so set your face and persevere in the religion which Allah has prescribed for you, the worship of Allah Alone, the religion of Ibrahim, to which Allah has guided you and which He has perfected for you with the utmost perfection. In this manner, you will also adhere to the sound Fitrah with which He created His creation.' Allah created His creation to recognize Him and know His Tawhid, and that there is no God except Him, as we have already seen when discussing the Ayah,  وَأَشْهَدَهُمْ عَلَى أَنفُسِهِمْ أَلَسْتَ بِرَبِّكُمْ قَالُواْ بَلَى  (and made them testify as to themselves (saying): \"Am I not your Lord\" They said: \"Yes!...\") (7:172). And according to a Hadith, Allah said,  «إِنِّي خَلَقْتُ عِبَادِي حُنَفَاءَ، فَاجْتَالَتْهُمُ الشَّيَاطِينُ عَنْ دِينِهِم»  (\"I created my servants Hunafa (i.e., monotheists), then the Shayatin misled them from their religion.\") We will see in the Hadiths that Allah created His creation with the Fitrah of Islam, then among some of them there emerged corrupt religions such as Judaism, Christianity and Zoroastrianism.  لاَ تَبْدِيلَ لِخَلْقِ اللَّهِ  (No change let there be in Allah's Khalq,) Some of them said that this means, `do not change the creation of Allah, for if you do, you will divert the people away from the Fitrah with which He created them.' So it is instructive; just as His saying:  وَمَن دَخَلَهُ كَانَ ءَامِناً  (And whoever enters it, he is safe) This is a good and correct interpretation. Others said that this means, Allah made all of His creation equal, all of them have the same sound Fitrah and are by nature upright; they are all born with this nature and there is no disparity among people in this regard. Ibn `Abbas, Ibrahim An-Nakha`i, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and Ibn Zayd said that the Ayah:  لاَ تَبْدِيلَ لِخَلْقِ اللَّهِ  (No change let there be in Allah's Khalq) means, the religion of Allah. Al-Bukhari said:  لاَ تَبْدِيلَ لِخَلْقِ اللَّهِ  (No change let there be in Allah's Khalq,) \"It means, the religion of Allah, and the religion, and the Fitrah is Islam.\" Then he reported that Abu Hurayrah said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:  «مَا مِنْ مَوْلُودٍ يُولَدُ إِلَّا عَلَى الْفِطْرَةِ فَأَبَوَاهُ يُهَوِّدَانِهِ أَوْ يُنَصِّرَانِهِ أَوْ يُمَجِّسَانِهِ،كَمَا تُنْتَجُ الْبَهِيمَةُ بَهِيمَةً جَمْعَاءَ، هَلْ تُحِسُّونَ فِيهَا مِنْ جَدْعَاءَ؟»  (No child is born except in a state of Fitrah, then his parents make him a Jew or a Christian or a Zoroastrian, just as each animal produces a perfect animal like itself -- do you see any among them that are born mutilated) then the narrator (Abu Hurayrah) said (recite this Ayah),  فِطْرَةَ اللَّهِ الَّتِى فَطَرَ النَّاسَ عَلَيْهَا لاَ تَبْدِيلَ لِخَلْقِ اللَّهِ ذَلِكَ الدِّينُ الْقَيِّمُ  (Allah's Fitrah with which He has created mankind. No change let there be in Allah's Khalq, that is the straight religion.)\" This was also recorded by Muslim.  ذلِكَ الدِّينُ الْقَيِّمُ  (that is the straight religion,) means, adherence to the Shari`ah and the sound Fitrah is the true, straight religion.  وَلَـكِنَّ أَكْثَرَ النَّاسِ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ  (but most men know not.) means, most people do not know this and they deviate far astray from it, as Allah says:  وَمَآ أَكْثَرُ النَّاسِ وَلَوْ حَرَصْتَ بِمُؤْمِنِينَ  (And most of mankind will not believe even if you desire it eagerly.) (12:103)  وَإِن تُطِعْ أَكْثَرَ مَن فِى الاٌّرْضِ يُضِلُّوكَ عَن سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ  (And if you obey most of those on the earth, they will mislead you far away from Allah's path) (6:116).  مُّنِيبِينَ إِلَيْهِ  (turning in repentance to Him) Ibn Zayd and Ibn Jurayj said, \"This means, returning to Him.\"  وَاتَّقُوهُ  (and have Taqwa of Him;) means, fear Him and remember that He is always watching.  وَأَقِيمُواْ الصَّلَوةَ  (and perform the Salah), which is the greatest act of worship.)  وَلاَ تَكُونُواْ مِنَ الْمُشْرِكِينَ  (and be not of the idolators.) Be of those who single out Allah, devoting their worship sincerely for Him alone, not anyone or anything other than Him. Ibn Jarir recorded that Yazid bin Abi Maryam said: \"`Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, passed by Mu`adh bin Jabal and asked, `What is the foundation of this Ummah' Mu`adh said, `Three things, and they are the things that will bring salvation: Al-Ikhlas (doing a deed for Allah alone), which is the Fitrah with which Allah created mankind; Salah, which is the thing that tells a believer apart from a disbeliever; and obedience, which is protection.' `Umar said: `You have spoken the truth. <h2>Splitting into Sects and the Saved Sect</h2> His saying:  مِنَ الَّذِينَ فَرَّقُواْ دِينَهُمْ وَكَانُواْ شِيَعاً كُلُّ حِزْبٍ بِمَا لَدَيْهِمْ فَرِحُونَ  (Of those who Farraqu Dinahum (split up their religion), and became sects, each sect rejoicing in that which is with it.) means, do not be of the idolators who split up their religion, i.e., changed it by believing in parts of it and rejecting other parts. Some scholars read this as Faraqu Dinahum, meaning \"neglected their religion and left it behind them.\" These are like the Jews, Christians, Zoroastrians, idol worshippers and all the followers of false religions, besides the followers of Islam, as Allah says:  إِنَّ الَّذِينَ فَرَّقُواْ دِينَهُمْ وَكَانُواْ شِيَعًا لَّسْتَ مِنْهُمْ فِى شَىْءٍ إِنَّمَآ أَمْرُهُمْ إِلَى اللَّهِ  (Verily, those who divide their religion and break up into sects, you have no concern in them in the least. Their affair is only with Allah) (6:159). The followers of the religions before us had differences of opinions and split into false sects, each group claiming to be following the truth. This Ummah too has split into sects, all of which are misguided apart from one, which is Ahlus-Sunnah Wal-Jama`ah, those who adhere to the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and what was followed by the first generations, the Companions, their followers, and the Imams of the Muslims of earlier and later times. In his Mustadrak, Al-Hakim recorded that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was asked which of the sects was the saved sect and he said:  «مَا أَنَا عَلَيْهِ وَأَصْحَابِي»  (What I and my Companions are upon.)
