tafsir[7]{c,v,t}:
  22,24,"<h2>The Reward of the Believers</h2> When Allah tells us about the state of the people of Hell -- we seek refuge with Allah from that state of punishment, vengeance, burning and chains -- and the garments of fire that have been prepared for them, He then tells us about the state of the people of Paradise -- we ask Allah by His grace and kindness to admit us therein. He tells us: ﴾إِنَّ اللَّهَ يُدْخِلُ الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّـلِحَـتِ جَنَـتٍ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهَا الاٌّنْهَـرُ﴿ (Truly, Allah will admit those who believe and do righteous good deeds, to Gardens underneath which rivers flow,) means, these rivers flow throughout its regions, beneath its trees and palaces, and its inhabitants direct them to go wherever they want. ﴾يُحَلَّوْنَ فِيهَا﴿ (wherein they will be adorned) -- with jewelry -- ﴾مِنْ أَسَاوِرَ مِن ذَهَبٍ وَلُؤْلُؤاً﴿ (with bracelets of gold and pearls) means, on their arms, as the Prophet said in the agreed-upon Hadith: ﴾«تَبْلُغُ الْحِلْيَةُ مِنَ الْمُؤْمِنِ حَيْثُ يَبْلُغُ الْوَضُوء»﴿ (The jewelry of the believer in Paradise will reach as far as his Wudu' reached.) ﴾وَلِبَاسُهُمْ فِيهَا حَرِيرٌ﴿ (and their garments therein will be of silk. ) in contrast to the garments of fire worn by the inhabitants of Hell, the people of Paradise will have garments of silk, Sundus and Istabraq fine green silk and gold embroidery, as Allah says: ﴾عَـلِيَهُمْ ثِيَابُ سُندُسٍ خُضْرٌ وَإِسْتَبْرَقٌ وَحُلُّواْ أَسَاوِرَ مِن فِضَّةٍ وَسَقَـهُمْ رَبُّهُمْ شَرَاباً طَهُوراً - إِنَّ هَـذَا كَانَ لَكُمْ جَزَآءً وَكَانَ سَعْيُكُم مَّشْكُوراً ﴿ (Their garments will be of green Sundus, and Istabraq. They will be adorned with bracelets of silver, and their Lord will give them a pure drink. (And it will be said to them): \"Verily, this is a reward for you, and your endeavor has been accepted.\") 76:21-22. In the Sahih, it says: ﴾«لَا تَلْبَسُوا الْحَرِيرَ وَلَا الدِّيبَاجَ فِي الدُّنْيَا، فَإِنَّهُ مَنْ لَبِسَهُ فِي الدُّنْيَا لَمْ يَلْبَسْهُ فِي الْآخِرَة»﴿ (Do not wear fine silk or gold embroidery in this world, for whoever wears them in this world, will not wear them in the Hereafter.) `Abdullah bin Az-Zubayr said, \"Those who do not wear silk in the Hereafter are those who will not enter Paradise. Allah says: ﴾وَلِبَاسُهُمْ فِيهَا حَرِيرٌ﴿ (and their garments therein will be of silk)\" ﴾وَهُدُواْ إِلَى الطَّيِّبِ مِنَ الْقَوْلِ﴿ (And they are guided unto goodly speech.) This is like the Ayat: ﴾وَأُدْخِلَ الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّـلِحَاتِ جَنَّـتٍ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهَا الأَنْهَـرُ خَـلِدِينَ فِيهَا بِإِذْنِ رَبِّهِمْ تَحِيَّتُهُمْ فِيهَا سَلَـمٌ ﴿ (And those who believed and did righteous deeds, will be made to enter Gardens under which rivers flow -- to dwell therein forever, with the permission of their Lord. Their greeting therein will be: \"Salam (peace!)\") 14:23 ﴾جَنَّـتُ عَدْنٍ يَدْخُلُونَهَا وَمَنْ صَلَحَ مِنْ ءَابَائِهِمْ وَأَزْوَجِهِمْ وَذُرِّيَّاتِهِمْ وَالمَلَـئِكَةُ يَدْخُلُونَ عَلَيْهِمْ مِّن كُلِّ بَابٍ - سَلَـمٌ عَلَيْكُم بِمَا صَبَرْتُمْ فَنِعْمَ عُقْبَى الدَّارِ ﴿ (And angels shall enter unto them from every gate (saying): \"Salamun `Alaykum (peace be upon you!)\", for you persevered in patience! Excellent indeed is the final home!\") 13:23-24, ﴾لاَ يَسْمَعُونَ فِيهَا لَغْواً وَلاَ تَأْثِيماً - إِلاَّ قِيلاً سَلَـماً سَلَـماً ﴿ (No evil vain talk will they hear therein, nor any sinful speech. But only the saying of, \"Peace! Peace! (Salaman! Salaman!).\") 56:25-26 They will be guided to a place in which they will hear good speech. ﴾وَيُلَقَّوْنَ فِيهَا تَحِيَّةً وَسَلَـماً﴿ (Therein they shall be met with greetings and the word of peace and respect.) 25:75, unlike the scorn which will be heaped upon the people of Hell by way of rebuke, when they are told: ﴾ذُوقُواْ عَذَابَ الْحَرِيقِ﴿ (`Taste the torment of burning!\") ﴾وَهُدُواْ إِلَى صِرَطِ الْحَمِيدِ﴿ (and they are guided to the path of Him Who is Worthy of all praises. ) to a place in which they will give praise to their Lord for all His kindness, blessings and favors towards them, as it says in the Sahih Hadith: ﴾«إِنَّهُمْ يُلْهَمُونَ التَّسْبِيحَ وَالتَّحْمِيدَ كَمَا يُلْهَمُونَ النَّفَس»﴿ (They will be inspired with words of glorification and praise, just as they are inspired with breath.) Some scholars of Tafsir said that the Ayah, ﴾وَهُدُواْ إِلَى الطَّيِّبِ مِنَ الْقَوْلِ﴿ (And they are guided unto goodly speech) refers to the Qur'an; and it was said that it means La ilaha illallah or words of remembrance prescribed in Islam. And the Ayah: ﴾وَهُدُواْ إِلَى صِرَطِ الْحَمِيدِ﴿ (and they are guided to the path of Him Who is Worthy of all praises.) means, the straight path in this world. These interpretations do not contradict that mentioned above. And Allah knows best. "
  22,25,"<h2>A Warning to Those Who hinder Others from the Path of Allah and from Al-Masj id Al-Haram and Who seek to do Evil Actions therein</h2> Allah rebukes the disbelievers for preventing the believers from coming to Al-Masjid Al-Haram and performing their rites and rituals there, claiming that they were its guardians,  وَمَا كَانُواْ أَوْلِيَآءَهُ إِنْ أَوْلِيَآؤُهُ إِلاَّ الْمُتَّقُونَ  (and they are not its guardians. None can be its guardians except those who have Taqwa) 8:34. In this Ayah there is proof that it was revealed in Al-Madinah, as Allah says in Surat Al-Baqarah:  يَسْـَلُونَكَ عَنِ الشَّهْرِ الْحَرَامِ قِتَالٍ فِيهِ قُلْ قِتَالٌ فِيهِ كَبِيرٌ وَصَدٌّ عَن سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ وَكُفْرٌ بِهِ وَالْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ وَإِخْرَاجُ أَهْلِهِ مِنْهُ أَكْبَرُ عِندَ اللَّهِ  (They ask you concerning fighting in the Sacred Months. Say, \"Fighting therein is a great (transgression) but a greater (transgression) with Allah is to prevent mankind from following the way of Allah, to disbelieve in Him, to prevent access to Al-Masjid Al-Haram, and to drive out its inhabitants) 2:217 And Allah says here:  إِنَّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ وَيَصُدُّونَ عَن سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ وَالْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ  (Verily, those who disbelieved and hinder (men) from the path of Allah, and from Al-Masjid Al-Haram) meaning, not only are they disbelievers, but they also hinder people from the path of Allah and from Al-Masjid Al-Haram. They prevent the believers who want to go there from reaching it, although the believers have more right than anyone else to go there. The structure of this phrase is like that to be found in the Ayah:  الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَتَطْمَئِنُّ قُلُوبُهُمْ بِذِكْرِ اللَّهِ أَلاَ بِذِكْرِ اللَّهِ تَطْمَئِنُّ الْقُلُوبُ  (Those who believed, and whose hearts find rest in the remembrance of Allah, verily, in the remembrance of Allah do hearts find rest.) 13:28 Not only are they believers, but their hearts also find rest in the remembrance of Allah. <h2>The Issue of renting Houses in Makkah</h2> الَّذِى جَعَلْنَـهُ لِلنَّاسِ سَوَآءً الْعَـكِفُ فِيهِ وَالْبَادِ  (which We have made (open) to (all) men, the dweller in it and the visitor from the country are equal there) meaning that they prevent people from reaching Al-Masjid Al-Haram, which Allah has made equally accessible to all in Shari`ah, with no differentiation between those who live there and those who live far away from it.  سَوَآءً الْعَـكِفُ فِيهِ وَالْبَادِ  (the dweller in it and the visitor from the country are equal there,) Part of this equality is that everyone has equal access to all parts of the city and can live there, as `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas concerning the Ayah:  سَوَآءً الْعَـكِفُ فِيهِ وَالْبَادِ  (the dweller in it and the visitor from the country are equal there,) He Ibn `Abbas said: \"Both the people of Makkah and others can stay in Al-Masjid Al-Haram.\"  سَوَآءً الْعَـكِفُ فِيهِ وَالْبَادِ  (the dweller in it and the visitor from the country are equal there,) Mujahid said, \"The people of Makkah and others are equally allowed to stay there.\" This was also the view of Abu Salih, `Abdur-Rahman bin Sabit and `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam. `Abdur-Razzaq narrated from Ma`mar, from Qatadah who said: \"Its own people and others are equal therein.\" This is the issue about which Ash-Shafi`i and Ishaq bin Rahwayh differed in the Masjid of Al-Khayf, when Ahmad bin Hanbal was also present. Ash-Shafi`i was of the opinion that the various parts of Makkah can be owned, inherited and rented, and he used as evidence the Hadith of Usamah bin Zayd who said, \"I said, O Messenger of Allah, will you go and stay tomorrow in your house in Makkah\" He said,  «وَهَلْ تَرَكَ لَنَا عَقِيلٌ مِنْ رِبَاعٍ؟»  (Has `Aqil left us any property) Then he said,  «لَا يَرِثُ الْكَافِرُ الْمُسْلِمَ وَلَا الْمُسْلِمُ الْكَافِر»  (A disbeliever does not inherit from a Muslim and a Muslim does not inherit from a disbeliever.) This Hadith was recorded in the Two Sahihs. He also used as evidence the report that `Umar bin Al-Khattab bought a house in Makkah from Safwan bin Umayyah for four thousand Dinars, and made it into a prison. This was also the view of Tawus and `Amr bin Dinar. Ishaq bin Rahwayh was of the opinion that they (houses in Makkah) could not be inherited or rented. This was the view of a number of the Salaf, and Mujahid and `Ata' said likewise. Ishaq bin Rahwayh used as evidence the report recorded by Ibn Majah from `Alqamah bin Nadlah who said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ, Abu Bakr and `Umar died, and nobody claimed any property in Makkah except the grazing animals. Whoever needed to live there would take up residence there, and whoever did not need to live there would let others take up residence there.\" `Abdur-Razzaq recorded that `Abdullah bin `Amr said, \"It is not allowed to sell or rent the houses of Makkah.\" He also said, narrating from Ibn Jurayj: \"`Ata' would not allow people to charge rent in the Haram, and he told me that `Umar bin Al-Khattab did not allow people to put gates on the houses of Makkah because the pilgrims used to stay in their courtyards. The first person to put a gate on his house was Suhayl bin `Amr. `Umar bin Al-Khattab sent for him about that and he said, `Listen to me, O Commander of the faithful, I am a man who engages in trade and I want to protect my back.' He said, `Then you may do that.\"' `Abdur-Razzaq recorded from Mujahid that `Umar bin Al-Khattab said, \"O people of Makkah, do not put gates on your houses, and let the bedouins stay wherever they want.\" He said: Ma`mar told us, narrating from someone who heard `Ata' say about the Ayah, x  سَوَآءً الْعَـكِفُ فِيهِ وَالْبَادِ  (the dweller in it and the visitor from the country are equal there, ) \"They may stay wherever they want.\" Ad-Daraqutni recorded a saying reported from `Abdullah bin `Amr: \"Whoever charges rent for the houses of Makkah, consumes fire.\" Imam Ahmad took a middle path, according to what his son Salih narrated from him, and he said, \"They may be owned and inherited, but they should not be rented, so as to reconcile between all the proofs.\" And Allah knows best. <h2>A Warning to Those Who want to commit Evil Actions in the Haram</h2> وَمَن يُرِدْ فِيهِ بِإِلْحَادٍ بِظُلْمٍ نُّذِقْهُ مِنْ عَذَابٍ أَلِيمٍ  (and whoever inclines to evil actions therein or to do wrong, him We shall cause to taste from a painful torment.)  بِظُلْمٍ  (or to do wrong,) means, he aims deliberately to do wrong, and it is not the matter of misunderstanding. As Ibn Jurayj said narrating from Ibn `Abbas, \"This means someone whose actions are intentional.\" `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas said, \"The evil action of Shirk.\" Al-`Awfi reported that Ibn `Abbas said: \"The evil action is allowing in the Haram what Allah has forbidden, such as mistreating and killing, whereby you do wrong to those who have done you no wrong and you kill those who have not fought you. If a person does this, then he deserves to suffer a painful torment.\"  بِظُلْمٍ  (or to do wrong,) Mujahid said, \"To do some bad action therein. This is one of the unique features of Al-Haram, that the person who is about to do some evil action should be punished if this is his intention, even if he has not yet commenced the action.\" Ibn Abi Hatim recorded in his Tafsir that `Abdullah (i.e., Ibn Mas`ud) commented about the Ayah,  وَمَن يُرِدْ فِيهِ بِإِلْحَادٍ بِظُلْمٍ  (and whoever inclines to evil actions therein or to do wrong,) \"If a man intends to do some evil action therein, Allah will make him taste a painful torment.\" This was also recorded by Ahmad. I say, its chain is Sahih according to the conditions of Al-Bukhari, and it is more likely Mawquf than Marfu`. And Allah knows best. Sa`id bin Jubayr said, \"Insulting a servant and anything more than that is (counted as) wrongdoing.\" Habib bin Abi Thabit said:  وَمَن يُرِدْ فِيهِ بِإِلْحَادٍ بِظُلْمٍ  (and whoever inclines to evil actions therein or to do wrong,) \"Hoarding (goods) in Makkah.\" This was also the view of others.  وَمَن يُرِدْ فِيهِ بِإِلْحَادٍ بِظُلْمٍ  (and whoever inclines to evil actions therein or to do wrong,) Ibn `Abbas said, \"This was revealed about `Abdullah bin Unays. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ sent him with two men, one of whom was a Muhajir and the other from among the Ansar. They began to boast about their lineages and `Abdullah bin Unays got angry and killed the Ansari. Then he reverted from Islam (became an apostate) and fled to Makkah. Then these words were revealed concerning him:  وَمَن يُرِدْ فِيهِ بِإِلْحَادٍ بِظُلْمٍ  (and whoever inclines to evil actions therein or to do wrong,) meaning, whoever flees to Al-Haram to do evil actions, i.e., by leaving Islam.\" These reports indicate some meanings of the phrase \"evil actions\", but the meaning is more general than that and includes things which are more serious. Hence when the owners of the Elephant planned to destroy the House (the Ka`bah), Allah sent against them birds in flocks,  تَرْمِيهِم بِحِجَارَةٍ مِّن سِجِّيلٍ - فَجَعَلَهُمْ كَعَصْفٍ مَّأْكُولِ  (Striking them with stones of Sijjil. And He made them like (an empty field of) stalks (of which the corn has been eaten up by cattle).) 105:4-5. means He destroyed them and made them a lesson and a warning for everyone who intends to commit evil actions there. Hence it was reported in a Hadith that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:  «يَغْزُو هَذَا الْبَيْتَ جَيْشٌ حَتَّى إِذَا كَانُوا بِبَيْدَاءَ مِنَ الْأَرْضِ خُسِفَ بِأَوَّلِهِمْ وَآخِرِهِم»  (This House will be attacked by an army, then when they are in a wide open space, the first of them and the last of them will be swallowed up by the earth.) "

  22,27,"<h2>Building of the Ka`bah and the Proclamation of the Hajj</h2> This is a rebuke to those among Quraysh who worshipped others than Allah and joined partners with Him in the place which from the outset had been established on the basis of Tawhid and the worship of Allah Alone, with no partner or associate. Allah tells us that He showed Ibrahim the site of the `Atiq House, i.e., He guided him to it, entrusted it to him and granted him permission to build it. Many scholars take this as evidence to support their view that Ibrahim was the first one to build the House and that it was not built before his time. It was recorded in the Two Sahihs that Abu Dharr said, \"I said, `O Messenger of Allah ﷺ, which Masjid was the first to be built' He said,  «الْمَسْجِدُ الْحَرَام»  (Al-Masjid Al-Haram.) I said, `Then which' He said,  «بَيْتُ الْمَقْدِس»  (Bayt Al-Maqdis.) I said, `How long between them' He said,  «أَرْبَعُونَ سَنَة»  (Forty years.)\" And Allah says:  إِنَّ أَوَّلَ بَيْتٍ وُضِعَ لِلنَّاسِ لَلَّذِى بِبَكَّةَ مُبَارَكاً  (Verily, the first House (of worship) appointed for mankind was that at Bakkah (Makkah), full of blessing) 3:96 until the end of following two Ayat. Allah says:  وَعَهِدْنَآ إِلَى إِبْرَهِيمَ وَإِسْمَـعِيلَ أَن طَهِّرَا بَيْتِىَ لِلطَّآئِفِينَ وَالْعَـكِفِينَ وَالرُّكَّعِ السُّجُودِ  (and We commanded Ibrahim and Isma`il that they should purify My House for those who are circumambulating it, or staying (I`tikaf), or bowing or prostrating themselves.) 2:125 And Allah says here:  أَن لاَّ تُشْرِكْ بِى شَيْئاً  (Associate not anything with Me,) meaning, `Build it in My Name Alone.'  وَطَهِّرْ بَيْتِىَ  (and sanctify My House) Qatadah and Mujahid said, \"And purify it from Shirk.  لِلطَّآئِفِينَ وَالْقَآئِمِينَ وَالرُّكَّعِ السُّجُودِ  (for those who circumambulate it, and those who stand up, and those who bow, and make prostration (in prayer)) means, `and make it purely for those who worship Allah Alone, with no partner or associate.' What is meant by \"those who circumambulate it\" is obvious, since this is an act of worship that is done only at the Ka`bah and not at any other spot on earth.  وَالْقَآئِمِينَ  (and those who stand up) means, in prayer. Allah says:  وَالرُّكَّعِ السُّجُودِ  (and those who bow, and make prostration.) Tawaf and prayer are mentioned together because they are not prescribed together anywhere except in relation to the House. Tawaf is done around the Ka`bah and prayer is offered facing its direction in the majority of cases, with a few exceptions, such as when one is uncertain of the direction of the Qiblah, during battle and when praying optional prayers while traveling. And Allah knows best.  وَأَذِّن فِى النَّاسِ بِالْحَجِّ  (And proclaim to mankind the Hajj) meaning, `announce the pilgrimage to mankind and call them to perform pilgrimage to this House which We have commanded you to build.' It was said that Ibrahim said: \"O Lord, how can I convey this to people when my voice will not reach them\" It was said: \"Call them and We will convey it.\" So Ibrahim stood up and said, \"O mankind! Your Lord has established a House so come on pilgrimage to it.\" It is said that the mountains lowered themselves so that his voice would reach all the regions of the earth, and those who were still in their mothers' wombs and their fathers' loins would hear the call. The response came from everyone in the cities, deserts and countryside, and those whom Allah has decreed will make the pilgrimage, until the Day of Resurrection: \"At Your service, O Allah, at Your service.\" This is a summary of the narrations from Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr and others among the Salaf. And Allah knows best. This was recorded by Ibn Jarir and by Ibn Abi Hatim at length.  يَأْتُوكَ رِجَالاً وَعَلَى كُلِّ ضَامِرٍ  (They will come to you on foot and on every lean camel,) This Ayah was used as evidence by those scholars whose view is that Hajj performed on foot by those who are able, is better than Hajj performed riding, because the phrase \"on foot\" is mentioned first, and because it is an indication of their keenness and resolve. Waki` narrated from Abu Al-`Umays from Abu Halhalah from Muhammad bin Ka`b that Ibn `Abbas said, \"I do not regret anything except for the fact that I wish I had performed Hajj on foot, because Allah says,  يَأْتُوكَ رِجَالاً  (They will come to you on foot).\" But the majority are of the view that performing Hajj while riding is better, following the example of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, because he performed Hajj riding, although his physical ability was sound.  يَأْتِينَ مِن كُلِّ فَجٍّ  (they will come from every Fajj) means every route, as Allah says:  وَجَعَلْنَا فِيهَا فِجَاجاً سُبُلاً  (and We placed therein Fijaj for them to pass) 21:31.  عَميِقٍ  (`Amiq) means dis- tant. This was the view of Mujahid, `Ata', As-Suddi, Qatadah, Muqatil bin Hayan, Ath-Thawri and others. This Ayah is like the Ayah in which Allah tells us how Ibrahim prayed for his family,  فَاجْعَلْ أَفْئِدَةً مَّنَ النَّاسِ تَهْوِى إِلَيْهِمْ  (So fill some hearts among men with love towards them) 14:37. There is no one among the Muslims who does not long to see the Ka`bah and perform Tawaf, people come to this spot from every corner of the world. "
