tafsir[4]{c,v,t}:
  9,69," بِخَلَـقِهِمْ  (their portion), means, they mocked their religion, according to Al-Hasan Al-Basri. Allah's statement,  وَخُضْتُمْ كَالَّذِي خَاضُواْ  (and you indulged in play and pastime as they indulged in play and pastime), indulged in lies and falsehood,  أُوْلَـئِكَ حَبِطَتْ أَعْمَـلُهُمْ  (Such are they whose deeds are in vain), their deeds are annulled; they will not acquire any rewards for them because they are invalid,  فِي الدنْيَا وَالاٌّخِرَةِ وَأُوْلَـئِكَ هُمُ الْخَـسِرُونَ  (in this world and in the Hereafter. Such are they who are the losers.) because they will not acquire any rewards for their actions. Ibn `Abbas commented, \"How similar is this night to the last night,  كَالَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِكُمْ  (Like those before you...) These are the Children of Israel, with whom we were compared. The Prophet said,  «وَالَّذِي نَفْسِي بِيَدِهِ لَتَتَّبِعُنَّهُمْ حَتَّى لَوْ دَخَلَ الرَّجُلُ مِنْهُمْ جُحْرَ ضَبَ لَدَخَلْتُمُوه»  (By He in Whose Hand is my life! You will imitate them, and even if a man of them entered the den of a lizard, you will enter it likewise!)\" Abu Hurayrah narrated that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,  «وَالَّذِي نَفْسِي بِيَدِهِ لَتَتَّبِعُنَّ سَنَنَ الَّذِينَ مِنْ قَبْلِكُمْ شِبْرًا بِشِبْرٍ وَذِرَاعًا بِذِرَاعٍ، وَبَاعًا بِبَاعٍ حَتَّى لَوْ دَخَلُوا جُحْرَ ضَبَ لَدَخَلْتُمُوه»  قالوا: ومن هم يا رسول الله، أهل الكتاب؟ قال:  «فَمَنْ؟»  (By He in Whose Hand is my soul! You will follow the traditions of those who were before you a hand span for a hand-span and forearm's length for forearm's length, and an arm's length for an arm's length. And even if they enter the den of a lizard, you will also enter it.) They asked, \"Who, O Allah's Messenger, the People of the Book\" He said, (Who else)\" This Hadith is similar to another Hadith collected in the Sahih. "
  9,70,"<h2>Advising the Hypocrites to learn a Lesson from Those before Them</h2> Allah advises the hypocrites who reject the Messengers,  ﴾أَلَمْ يَأْتِهِمْ نَبَأُ الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ﴿ (Has not the story reached them of those before them) have you (hypocrites) not learned the end of the nations before you who rejected the Messengers,  ﴾قَوْمُ نُوحٍ﴿ (The people of Nuh), and the flood that drowned the entire population of the earth, except those who believed in Allah's servant and Messenger Nuh, peace be upon him,  ﴾وَعَادٌ﴿ (and `Ad), who perished with the barren wind when they rejected Hud, peace be upon him,  ﴾وَثَمُودُ﴿ (and Thamud), who were overtaken by the Sayhah (awful cry) when they denied Salih, peace be upon him, and killed the camel,  ﴾وَقَوْمِ إِبْرَهِيمَ﴿ (and the people of Ibrahim), over whom He gave Ibrahim victory and the aid of clear miracles. Allah destroyed their king Nimrod, son of Canaan, son of Koch from Canaan, may Allah curse him,  ﴾وِأَصْحَـبِ مَدْيَنَ﴿ (and the dwellers of Madyan), the people of Shu`ayb, peace be upon him, who were destroyed by the earthquake and the torment of the day of the Shade,  ﴾وَالْمُؤْتَفِكَـتِ﴿ (and the overturned cities), the people of Lut who used to live in Madyan. Allah said in another Ayah,  ﴾وَالْمُؤْتَفِكَةَ أَهْوَى ﴿ (And He destroyed the overturned cities) 53:53, meaning the people of the overturned cities in reference to Sadum Sodom, their major city. Allah destroyed them all because they rejected Allah's Prophet Lut, peace be upon him, and because they committed the sin that none before them had committed homosexuality.  ﴾أَتَتْهُمْ رُسُلُهُمْ بِالْبَيِّنَـتِ﴿ (to them came their Messengers with clear proofs.), and unequivocal evidence,  ﴾فَمَا كَانَ اللَّهُ لِيَظْلِمَهُمْ﴿ (So it was not Allah Who wronged them), when He destroyed them, for He established the proofs against them by sending the Messengers and dissipating the doubts,  ﴾وَلَـكِن كَانُواْ أَنفُسَهُمْ يَظْلِمُونَ﴿ (but they used to wrong themselves), on account of their denying the Messengers and defying the Truth; this is why they earned the end, torment and punishment, that they did.  "
  9,71,"<h2>Qualities of Faithful Believers</h2> After Allah mentioned the evil characteristics of the hypocrites, He then mentioned the good qualities of the believers,  ﴾وَالْمُؤْمِنُونَ وَالْمُؤْمِنَـتِ بَعْضُهُمْ أَوْلِيَآءُ بَعْضٍ﴿ (The believers, men and women, are supporters of one another;) they help and aid each other. Surely, an authentic Hadith states,  ﴾«الْمُؤْمِنُ لِلْمُؤْمِنِ كَالْبُنْيَانِ يَشُدُّ بَعْضُهُ بَعْضًا»﴿ (The believer to the believer is just like a building, its parts support each other.) and the Prophet crossed his fingers together. In the Sahih it is recorded,  ﴾«مَثَلُ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ فِي تَوَادِّهِمْ وَتَرَاحُمِهِمْ كَمَثَلِ الْجَسَدِ الْوَاحِدِ، إِذَا اشْتَكَى مِنْهُ عُضْوٌ تَدَاعَى لَهُ سَائِرُ الْجَسَدِ بِالْحُمَّى وَالسَّهَر»﴿ (The example of the believers in the compassion and mercy they have for each other, is the example of one body: if a part of it falls ill, the rest of the body suffers with fever and sleeplessness.) Allah's statement,  ﴾يَأْمُرُونَ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ وَيَنْهَوْنَ عَنِ الْمُنْكَرِ﴿ (...they enjoin good, and forbid evil), this is similar to,  ﴾وَلْتَكُن مِّنْكُمْ أُمَّةٌ يَدْعُونَ إِلَى الْخَيْرِ وَيَأْمُرُونَ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ وَيَنْهَوْنَ عَنِ الْمُنْكَرِ﴿ (Let there arise out of you a group of people inviting to all that is good, enjoining Al-Ma`ruf and forbidding the Munkar...) 3:104. Allah said next,  ﴾وَيُقِيمُونَ الصَّلَوةَ وَيُؤْتُونَ الزَّكَوةَ﴿ (they perform the Salah, and give the Zakah), they obey Allah and are kind to His creation,  ﴾وَيُطِيعُونَ اللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ﴿ (and obey Allah and His Messenger), concerning what he commands and refraining from what he prohibits,  ﴾أُوْلَـئِكَ سَيَرْحَمُهُمُ اللَّهُ﴿ (Allah will have mercy on them.) Therefore, Allah will give mercy to those who have these qualities,  ﴾أَنَّ اللَّهَ عَزِيزٌ﴿ (Surely, Allah is All-Mighty), He grants glory to those who obey Him, for indeed, might and glory is from Allah Who gives it to His Messenger and the believers,  ﴾حَكِيمٌ﴿ (All-Wise), in granting these qualities to the believers, while giving evil characteristics to hypocrites. Surely, Allah's wisdom is perfect in all His actions; praise and glory be to Him.  "
  9,72,"<h2>Good News for the Believers of Eternal Delight</h2> Allah describes the joys and eternal delight He has prepared for the believers, men and women in,  جَنَّـتٌ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهَا الاٌّنْهَـرُ خَـلِدِينَ فِيهَا  (Gardens under which rivers flow to dwell therein forever) for eternity,  وَمَسَـكِنَ طَيِّبَةً  (and beautiful mansions), built beautifully in good surroundings. In the Two Sahihs, it is recorded that Abu Musa, `Abdullah bin Qays Al-Ash`ari said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,  «جَنَّتَانِ مِنْ ذَهَبٍ آنِيَتُهُمَا وَمَا فِيهِمَا، وَجَنَّتَانِ مِنْ فِضَّةٍ آنِيَتُهُمَا وَمَا فِيهِمَا، وَمَا بَيْنَ الْقَوْمِ وَبَيْنَ أَنْ يَنْظُرُوا إِلَى رَبِّهِمْ إِلَّا رِدَاءُ الْكِبْرِيَاءِ عَلَى وَجْهِهِ فِي جَنَّةِ عَدْن»  (Two gardens, their pots and whatever is in them are made of gold, and two gardens, their pots and whatever is in them are made of silver. Only the Veil of Pride of Allah's Face separates the people from gazing at Him, in the garden of Eden.) He also narrated that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,  «إِنَّ لِلْمُؤْمِنِ فِي الْجَنَّةِ لَخَيْمَةً مِنْ لُؤْلُؤَةٍ وَاحِدَةٍ مُجَوَّفَةٍ، طُولُهَا سِتُّونَ مِيلًا فِي السَّمَاءِ لِلْمُؤْمِنِ فِيهَا أَهْلُونَ يَطُوفُ عَلَيْهِمْ لَا يَرَى بَعْضُهُمْ بَعْضًا»  (For the believer in Paradise there is a tent like a hollow pearl which is sixty miles high in the sky, and in the tent the believer will have (so large) a family that he visits them all and some of them would not be able to see the others. ) The Two Sahihs collected this Hadith. It is recorded in the Two Sahihs that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,  «مَنْ آمَنَ بِاللهِ وَرَسُولِهِ وَأَقَامَ الصَّلَاةَ وَصَامَ رَمَضَانَ، فَإِنَّ حَقًّا عَلَى اللهِ أَنْ يُدْخِلَهُ الْجَنَّةَ هَاجَرَ فِي سَبِيلِ اللهِ، أَوْ (جَلَسَ) فِي أَرْضِهِ الَّتِي وُلِدَ فِيهَا»  قالوا: يا رسول الله أفلا نخبر الناس؟ قال:  «إِنَّ فِي الْجَنَّةِ مِائَةَ دَرَجَةٍ أَعَدَّهَا اللهُ لِلْمُجَاهِدِينَ فِي سَبِيلِهِ بَيْنَ كُلِّ دَرَجَتَيْنِ كَمَا بَيْنَ السَّمَاءِ وَالْأَرْضِ، فَإِذَا سَأَلْتُمُ اللهَ فَاسْأَلُوهُ الْفِرْدَوْسَ فَإِنَّهُ أَعْلَى الْجَنَّةِ وَأَوْسَطُ الْجَنَّةِ، وَمِنْهُ تَفَجَّرُ أَنْهَارُ الْجَنَّةِ، وَفَوْقَهُ عَرْشُ الرَّحْمَن»  (Whoever believes in Allah and His Messenger, offers prayer perfectly and fasts the month of Ramadan, will rightfully be granted Paradise by Allah, no matter whether he emigrates in Allah's cause, or remains in the land where he is born.) The people said, \"O Allah's Messenger! Shall we acquaint the people with this good news\" He said, (Paradise has one-hundred grades which Allah has prepared for the Mujahidin who fight in His cause, the distance between each two grades is like the distance between the heaven and the earth. So, when you ask Allah, ask Him for Al-Firdaws which is the best and highest part of Paradise, from it gush forth the rivers of Paradise and above it is the `Arsh (Throne) of the Beneficent.) Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah said, that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,  «إِذَا صَلَّيْتُمْ عَلَيَّ فَسَلُوا اللهَ لِيَ الْوَسِيلَة»  قيل يا رسول الله وما الوسيلة؟قال:  «أَعْلَى دَرَجَةٍ فِي الْجَنَّةِ لَا يَنَالُهَا إِلَّا رَجُلٌ وَاحِدٌ وَأَرْجُو أَنْ أَكُونَ أَنَا هُو»  (If you invoke Allah for Salah (blessings) on me, then also invoke Him to grant me Al-Wasilah.) He was asked, \"What is Al-Wasilah, O Allah's Messenger\" He said, (The highest grade in Paradise, it will be for only one man, and I hope I am that man.) The Musnad contains a Hadith from Sa`d bin Mujahid At-Ta'i, that Abu Al-Mudillah said, that Abu Hurayrah said, \"We said, `O Allah's Messenger! Talk to us about Paradise, what is it built of' He said,  «لِبَنَةُ ذَهَبٍ وَلِبَنَةُ فِضَّةٍ، وَمِلَاطُهَا الْمِسْكُ وَحَصْبَاؤُهَا اللُّؤْلُؤُ وَالْيَاقُوتُ، وَتُرَابُهَا الزَّعْفَرَانُ. مَنْ يَدْخُلُهَا يَنْعَمُ لَا يَبْأَسُ وَيَخْلُدُ لَايَمُوتُ، لَا تَبْلَى ثِيَابُهُ وَلَا يَفْنَى شَبَابُه»  (A brick of gold and a brick of silver. Its mortar is from musk, its gravel is pearls and rubies. Its sand is saffron. Whoever enters it will enjoy the delights, will never be hopeless, and will live forever and will not die. His clothes will never decay nor will his youth ever end.)\" Allah said next,  وَرِضْوَنٌ مِّنَ اللَّهِ أَكْبَرُ  (But the greatest bliss is the good pleasure of Allah)9:72, meaning, Allah's pleasure is more grand, greater and better than the delight the believers will be enjoying in Paradise. Imam Malik narrated, that Zayd bin Aslam said that `Ata' bin Yasar said that Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,  «إِنَّ اللهَ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ يَقُولُ لِأَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ: يَا أَهْلَ الْجَنَّةِ فَيَقُولُونَ: لَبَّيْكَ رَبَّنَا وَسَعْدَيْكَ وَالْخَيْرُ فِي يَدَيْكَ. فَيَقُولُ: هَلْ رَضِيتُمْ؟ فَيَقُولُونَ: وَمَا لَنَا لَا نَرْضَى يَا رَبِّ وَقَدْ أَعْطَيْتَنَا مَا لَمْ تُعْطِ أَحَدًا مِنْ خَلْقِكَ، فَيَقُولُ: أَلَا أُعْطِيكُمْ أَفْضَلَ مِنْ ذَلِكَ؟ فَيَقُولُونَ: يَا رَبِّ وَأَيُّ شَيْءٍ أَفْضَلُ مِنْ ذَلِكَ؟ فَيَقُولُ: أُحِلُّ عَلَيْكُمْ رِضْوَانِي فَلَا أَسْخَطُ عَلَيْكُمْ بَعْدَهُ أَبَدًا»  (Allah, the Exalted and Ever High, will say to the people of Paradise, `O residents of Paradise!' They will say, `Labbayka (here we are!), our Lord, and Sa`dayk (we are happy at your service!) and all the good is in Your Hand.' He will ask them, `Are you pleased' They will say, `Why would not we be pleased, O Lord, while You have given us what You have not given any other of your creation' He will say, `Should I give you what is better than all this' They will say, `O Lord! What is better than all this' He will say, `I will grant you My pleasure and will never afterwards be angry with you.') The Two Sahihs collected the Hadith of Malik. "
