  16,27,"<h2>Discussion about what the previous Peoples did, and what was done to Them</h2> قَدْ مَكَرَ الَّذِينَ مِنْ قَبْلِهِمْ  (Those before them indeed plotted,) Al-`Awfi reported that Ibn `Abbas said: \"This refers to Namrud (Nimrod), who built the tower.\" Others said that it refers to Bukhtanassar (Nebuchadnezzar). The correct view is that this is said by way of example, to refute what was done by those who disbelieved in Allah and associated others in worship with Him. As Nuh said,  وَمَكَرُواْ مَكْراً كُبَّاراً  (\"And they have hatched a mighty scheme.\") (71:22) meaning, they used all sorts of ploys to misguide their people, and tempted them to join them in their Shirk via all possible means. On the Day of Resurrection their followers will say to them:  بَلْ مَكْرُ الَّيْلِ وَالنَّهَارِ إِذْ تَأْمُرُونَنَآ أَن نَّكْفُرَ بِاللَّهِ وَنَجْعَلَ لَهُ أَندَاداً  (\"Nay, but it was your plotting by night and day, when you ordered us to disbelieve in Allah and set up rivals to Him!\") (34:33)  فَأَتَى اللَّهُ بُنْيَـنَهُمْ مِّنَ الْقَوَاعِدِ  (but Allah struck at the foundation of their building.) meaning, He uprooted it and brought their efforts to naught. This is like the Ayah:  كُلَّمَآ أَوْقَدُواْ نَاراً لِّلْحَرْبِ أَطْفَأَهَا اللَّهُ  (Every time they kindled the fire of war, Allah extinguished it.) 5:64 and  فَأَتَـهُمُ اللَّهُ مِنْ حَيْثُ لَمْ يَحْتَسِبُواْ وَقَذَفَ فِى قُلُوبِهِمُ الرُّعْبَ يُخْرِبُونَ بُيُوتَهُمْ بِأَيْدِيهِمْ وَأَيْدِى الْمُؤْمِنِينَ فَاعْتَبِرُواْ يأُوْلِى الاٌّبْصَـرِ  (But Allah's (torment) reached them from a place where they were not expecting it, and He cast terror into their hearts so that they destroyed their own dwellings with their own hands and the hands of the believers. So then take admonition, O you with eyes (to see).) 59:2 Allah says here:  فَأَتَى اللَّهُ بُنْيَـنَهُمْ مِّنَ الْقَوَاعِدِ فَخَرَّ عَلَيْهِمُ السَّقْفُ مِن فَوْقِهِمْ وَأَتَـهُمُ الْعَذَابُ مِنْ حَيْثُ لاَ يَشْعُرُونَثُمَّ يَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ يُخْزِيهِمْ  (but Allah struck at the foundation of their building, and then the roof fell down upon them, from above them, and the torment overtook them from directions they did not perceive. Then, on the Day of Resurrection, He will disgrace them) 16:26-27 meaning, He will expose their scandalous deeds and what they used to hide in their hearts, and He will bring it out in the open. As He says,  يَوْمَ تُبْلَى السَّرَآئِرُ  (The Day when all the secrets will be (exposed and) examined. ) (86:9) They will be displayed and made known, as found in the Two Sahihs, where Ibn `Umar reported that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:  «يُنْصَبُ لِكُلِّ غَادِرٍ لِوَاءٌ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ عِنْدَ اسْتِهِ بِقَدْرِ غَدْرَتِهِ، فَيُقَالُ: هَذِهِ غَدْرَةُ فُلَانِ ابْنِ فُلَان»  (On the Day of Resurrection a banner will be set up by his backside for every deceitful person, (whose size is) in accordance with the amount of his deceit. It be said, \"This is the one who deceived so-and-so, the son of so-and-so.\") Thus, what they used to plot in secret will be made public. Allah will humiliate them before all of His creation, and the Lord will say to them, in rebuke and reprimand;  أَيْنَ شُرَكَآئِىَ الَّذِينَ كُنتُمْ تُشَـقُّونَ فِيهِمْ  (Where are My (so-called) partners, those over which you caused so much discord) meaning, you fought and made enemies for their sake, so where are they now to help and save you  هَلْ يَنصُرُونَكُمْ أَوْ يَنتَصِرُونَ  (Can they help you or (even) help themselves) 26:93  فَمَا لَهُ مِن قُوَّةٍ وَلاَ نَاصِرٍ  (Then will (man) have no power, nor any helper.) 86:10 When evidence and proof is established against them, and the Word (of Allah) is justified against them, and they will be unable to give any excuse, realizing that escape is impossible, then  قَالَ الَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ الْعِلْمَ  (Those who have been given the knowledge will say) who are the leaders in this world and the Hereafter and who know about the truth in this world and the Hereafter - will say,  إِنَّ الْخِزْىَ الْيَوْمَ وَالْسُّوءَ عَلَى الْكَـفِرِينَ  (Indeed it is a Day of disgrace and misery for the disbelievers.) meaning, today those who disbelieved in Allah and worshipped others who have no power either to benefit or to harm them are now surrounded by disgrace and punishment.

  16,29,"<h2>The Condition of the Disbeliever during and after Death</h2> Allah informs us of the state of the idolators who are doing wrong to themselves when death approaches and the angels come to seize their evil souls.  ﴾فَأَلْقَوُاْ السَّلَمَ﴿ (Then, they will (falsely) submit) meaning, they will make it appear as if they used to listen and obey by saying,  ﴾مَا كُنَّا نَعْمَلُ مِن سُوءٍ﴿ (We did not do any evil.) Similarly, on the Day of Resurrection, they will say,  ﴾وَاللَّهِ رَبِّنَا مَا كُنَّا مُشْرِكِينَ﴿ (By Allah, our Lord, we were not idolators.) 6:23  ﴾يَوْمَ يَبْعَثُهُمُ اللَّهِ جَمِيعاً فَيَحْلِفُونَ لَهُ كَمَا يَحْلِفُونَ لَكُمْ﴿ (On the Day when Allah will resurrect them all together; then they will swear to Him as they swear to you.) 58:18 Allah says, rejecting what they say,  ﴾الَّذِينَ تَتَوَفَّـهُمُ الْمَلَـئِكَةُ ظَالِمِى أَنفُسِهِمْ فَأَلْقَوُاْ السَّلَمَ مَا كُنَّا نَعْمَلُ مِن سُوءٍ بَلَى إِنَّ اللَّهَ عَلِيمٌ بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ - فَادْخُلُواْ أَبْوَابَ جَهَنَّمَ خَـلِدِينَ فِيهَا فَلَبِئْسَ مَثْوَى الْمُتَكَبِّرِينَ ﴿ (\"Yes! Truly, Allah is Most Knowing of what you did. So enter the gates of Hell, to abide therein, and indeed, what an evil abode there is for the arrogant.\") (16:28-29), meaning, a miserable position in the abode of humiliation for those who were too arrogant to pay atten- tion to the signs of Allah and follow His Messengers. They will enter Hell from the day they die with their souls, and their bodies will feel the heat and hot winds of their graves. When the Day of Resurrec- tion comes, their souls will be reunited with their bodies, to abide forever in the fire of Hell, and  ﴾لاَ يُقْضَى عَلَيْهِمْ فَيَمُوتُواْ وَلاَ يُخَفَّفُ عَنْهُمْ مِّنْ عَذَابِهَا﴿ (It will not be complete enough to kill them nor shall its torment be lightened for them.) (35:36) As Allah says,  ﴾النَّارُ يُعْرَضُونَ عَلَيْهَا غُدُوّاً وَعَشِيّاً وَيَوْمَ تَقُومُ السَّاعَةُ أَدْخِلُواْ ءَالَ فِرْعَوْنَ أَشَدَّ الْعَذَابِ ﴿ (The Fire, they are exposed to it morning and afternoon. And on the Day when the Hour will be established (it will be said to the angels): \"Cause Fir'awn's people to enter the severest torment!\") (40:46).  "

  16,32,"<h2>What the Pious say about the Revelation, their Reward and their Condition during and after Death</h2> Here we are told about the blessed, as opposed to the doomed, who, when they are asked,  ﴾مَّاذَآ أَنزَلَ رَبُّكُمْ﴿ (What is it that your Lord has revealed) they will reluctantly answer, \"He did not reveal anything, these are just the fables of old.\" But the blessed, on the other hand, will say, \"That which is good,\" meaning - He revealed something good, meaning mercy and blessings for those who followed it and believed in it. Then we are told about Allah's promise to His servants which He revealed to His Messengers. He says:  ﴾لِّلَّذِينَ أَحْسَنُواْ فِى هذِهِ الْدُّنْيَا حَسَنَةٌ﴿ (For those who do good in this world, there is good) This is like the Ayah,  ﴾مَنْ عَمِلَ صَـلِحاً مِّن ذَكَرٍ أَوْ أُنْثَى وَهُوَ مُؤْمِنٌ فَلَنُحْيِيَنَّهُ حَيَوةً طَيِّبَةً وَلَنَجْزِيَنَّهُمْ أَجْرَهُم بِأَحْسَنِ مَا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ ﴿ (Whoever works righteousness - whether male or female - while being a true believer verily, to him We will give a good life, and We shall certainly reward them in proportion to the best of what they used to do.) (16:97), which means that whoever does good in this world, Allah will reward him for his good deeds in this world and in the next. Then we are told that the home of the Hereafter will be better, i.e., better than the life of this world, and that the reward in the Hereafter will be more complete than the reward in this life, as Allah says,  ﴾وَقَالَ الَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ الْعِلْمَ وَيْلَكُمْ ثَوَابُ اللَّهِ خَيْرٌ﴿ (But those who were given (religious) knowledge said: \"Woe to you! The reward of Allah (in the Hereafter) is better) 28:80 and,  ﴾وَمَا عِندَ اللَّهِ خَيْرٌ لِّلأَبْرَارِ﴿ (and what is with Allah for the righteous is better.) 3:198 and;  ﴾وَالاٌّخِرَةُ خَيْرٌ وَأَبْقَى ﴿ (Although the Hereafter is better and enduring) (87:17). Allah said to His Messenger :  ﴾وَلَلاٌّخِرَةُ خَيْرٌ لَّكَ مِنَ الاٍّولَى ﴿ (And indeed the Hereafter is better for you than the present) (93:4). Then Allah describes the abode of the Hereafter, saying,  ﴾وَلَنِعْمَ دَارُ الْمُتَّقِينَ﴿ (And excellent indeed will be the home (i.e. Paradise) of those who have Taqwa.)  ﴾جَنَّـتِ عَدْنٍ﴿ (`Adn (Eden) Paradise (Gardens of Eternity)) refers to the home of the Muttaqun, i.e., in the Hereafter they will have Gardens of Eternity in which they will dwell forever.  ﴾تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهَا الأَنْهَـرُ﴿ (under which rivers flow) meaning, between its trees and palaces.  ﴾لَّهُمْ فِيهَا مَا يَشَآءُونَ﴿ (in it they will have all that they wish) this is like the Ayah:  ﴾وَفِيهَا مَا تَشْتَهِيهِ الاٌّنْفُسُ وَتَلَذُّ الاٌّعْيُنُ وَأَنتُمْ فِيهَا خَـلِدُونَ﴿ (in it (there will be) all that souls could desire, and all that eyes could delight in, and in it you will live forever.) 43:71  ﴾كَذَلِكَ يَجْزِى اللَّهُ الْمُتَّقِينَ﴿ (Thus Allah rewards those who have Taqwa.) meaning, this is how Allah rewards everyone who believes in Him, fears Him, and does good deeds. Then Allah tells us about their condition when death approaches them in a good state, i.e., free from Shirk, impurity and all evil. The angels greet them and give them the good news of Paradise, as Allah says:  ﴾إِنَّ الَّذِينَ قَالُواْ رَبُّنَا اللَّهُ ثُمَّ اسْتَقَـمُواْ تَتَنَزَّلُ عَلَيْهِمُ الْمَلَـئِكَةُ أَلاَّ تَخَافُواْ وَلاَ تَحْزَنُواْ وَأَبْشِرُواْ بِالْجَنَّةِ الَّتِى كُنتُمْ تُوعَدُونَ - نَحْنُ أَوْلِيَآؤُكُمْ فِى الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا وَفِى الاٌّخِرَةِ وَلَكُمْ فِيهَا مَا تَشْتَهِى أَنفُسُكُمْ وَلَكُمْ فِيهَا مَا تَدَّعُونَ - نُزُلاً مِّنْ غَفُورٍ رَّحِيمٍ ﴿ (Verily, those who say: \"Our Lord is Allah (alone),\" and then behave righteously, on them the angels will descend (at the time of their death) (saying): \"Fear not, nor grieve! But receive the good news of Paradise as you have been promised! We have been your friends in the life of this world and are (so) in the Hereafter. In it you shall have (all) that your souls desire, and in it you shall have (all) that you ask for. An entertainment from (Allah), the Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.\")(41:30:32) We have already referred to the Hadiths that have been reported on the taking of the soul of the believer and the soul of the disbeliever, when we discussed the Ayah,  ﴾يُثَبِّتُ اللَّهُ الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ بِالْقَوْلِ الثَّابِتِ فِى الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا وَفِى الاٌّخِرَةِ وَيُضِلُّ اللَّهُ الظَّـلِمِينَ وَيَفْعَلُ اللَّهُ مَا يَشَآءُ ﴿ (Allah will keep firm those who believe, with the word that stands firm in this world (i.e. they will keep on worshipping Allah Alone and none else), and in the Hereafter. And Allah will cause the wrongdoers to stray, and Allah does as He wills.) (14:27)  "
  16,33,"1935"
  16,34,"<h2>The Disbelievers' Refrain from Faith means that They were simply awaiting Punishment</h2> Threatening the idolators for their persistence in falsehood and their conceited delusions about this world, Allah says: Are these people waiting only for the angels to come and take their souls Qatadah said:  ﴾أَوْ يَأْتِىَ أَمْرُ رَبِّكَ﴿ (Or there comes the command of your Lord) means the Day of Resurrection and the terror that they will go through.\"  ﴾كَذَلِكَ فَعَلَ الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ﴿ (Thus did those before them.) means, thus did their predecessors and those who were like them among the idolators persist in their Shirk, until they tasted the wrath of Allah and experienced the punishment and torment that they suffered.  ﴾وَمَا ظَلَمَهُمُ اللَّهُ﴿ (And Allah did not wrong them.) because by sending His Messengers and revealing His Books He gave them enough warning and clearly demonstrated His proofs to them.  ﴾وَلَـكِن كَانُواْ أَنفُسَهُمْ يَظْلِمُونَ﴿ (but they were wronging themselves.) meaning, by opposing the Messengers and denying what they brought. For this reason Allah's punishment tormented them.  ﴾وَحَاقَ بِهِم﴿ (they were surrounded) meaning, they were overwhelmed by the painful torment.  ﴾مَا كَانُواْ بِهِ يَسْتَهْزِءُونَ﴿ (by that which they used to mock.) meaning, they used to make fun of the Messengers when they warned them Allah's punishment, and for this it will be said to them on the Day of Resurrection:  ﴾هَـذِهِ النَّارُ الَّتِى كُنتُم بِهَا تُكَذِّبُونَ ﴿ (This is the Fire which you used to belie.) (52:14).  "
