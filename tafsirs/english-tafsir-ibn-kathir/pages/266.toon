  15,72,"<h2>The People of the City arrive upon the Angels, thinking that they are Men</h2> Allah tells us about how Lut's people came to him when they found out about his handsome guests, and they came happily rejoicing about them.  قَالَ إِنَّ هَـؤُلآءِ ضَيْفِى فَلاَ تَفْضَحُونِ - وَاتَّقُواْ اللَّهَ وَلاَ تُخْزُونِ  (Lut said: \"Verily, these are my guests, so do not shame me. And have Taqwa of Allah, and do not disgrace me.\") This is what Lut said to them before he knew that his guests were messengers from Allah, as mentioned in Surat Hud, but here (in this Surah), we have already been told that they are messengers from Allah, and this is followed by an account of Lut's people coming and his exchange with them. However, here the conjunction (wa, meaning \"and\") does not imply the sequence of events, especially since there is something to indicate that this is not the case. They said answering him,  أَوَلَمْ نَنْهَكَ عَنِ الْعَـلَمِينَ  (Did we not forbid you from entertaining (or protecting) any of the `Alamin) meaning, `did we not tell you that you should not have anyone as a guest' He reminded them about their womenfolk and what their Lord had created for them in the women of permissible sexual relationships. This issue has already been explained and is no need to repeat the discussion here. All of this happened while they were still unaware of the inevitable calamity and punishment that was about to befall them the following morning. Hence Allah, may He be exalted, said to Muhammad ﷺ,  لَعَمْرُكَ إِنَّهُمْ لَفِى سَكْرَتِهِمْ يَعْمَهُونَ  (Verily, by your life, in their wild intoxication, they were wandering blindly.) Allah swore by the life of His Prophet , which is an immense honor reflecting his high rank and noble status. `Amr bin Malik An-Nakari reported from Abu Al-Jawza' that Ibn `Abbas said: \"Allah has never created or made or formed any soul that is dearer to him than Muhammad ﷺ. I never heard that Allah swore by the life of anyone else. Allah says,  لَعَمْرُكَ إِنَّهُمْ لَفِى سَكْرَتِهِمْ يَعْمَهُونَ  (Verily, by your life, in their wild intoxication, they were wandering blindly.) meaning, by your life and the length of your stay in this world,  إِنَّهُمْ لَفِى سَكْرَتِهِمْ يَعْمَهُونَ  (in their wild intoxication, they were wandering blindly.) This was reported by Ibn Jarir. Qatadah said:  لَفِى سَكْرَتِهِمْ  (in their wild intoxication) \"It means - in their misguided state;  يَعْمَهُونَ  (they were wandering blindly) means - they were playing. \" `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas said:  لَعَمْرُكَ  (Verily, by your life) means by your life, and  إِنَّهُمْ لَفِى سَكْرَتِهِمْ يَعْمَهُونَ  (in their wild intoxica- tion, they were wandering blindly.) means that they were confused.\" "

  15,77,"<h2>The Destruction of the People of Lut</h2> Allah said; ﴾فَأَخَذَتْهُمُ الصَّيْحَةُ﴿ (So the Sayhah overtook them) This is the piercing sound that came to them when the sun rose, which was accompanied by the city being flipped upside down, and stones of baked clay (As-Sijjil) raining down upon them. The discussion of As-Sijjil in Surah Hud is a sufficient explanation. Allah said: ﴾إِنَّ فِى ذَلِكَ لآيَـتٍ لِلْمُتَوَسِّمِينَ ﴿ (Surely, in this are signs for those who see.) meaning that the traces of the destruction of that city are easily visible to any one who ponder about it, whether they look at it with physical eyesight or mental and spiritual insight, as Mujahid said concerning the phrase, ﴾لِلْمُتَوَسِّمِينَ﴿ (those who see) he said, \"those who have insight and discernment.\" It was reported from Ibn `Abbas and Ad-Dahhak that it referred to those who look. Qatadah said: \"those who learn lessons\". ﴾لِلْمُتَوَسِّمِينَ﴿ (those who see) therefore the meaning is \"those who ponder\". <h2>The City of Sodom on the Highroad</h2>﴾وَإِنَّهَا لَبِسَبِيلٍ مُّقِيمٍ ﴿ (And verily, they were right on the highroad.) meaning that the city of Sodom, which was physically and spiritually turned upside down, and pelted with stones until it became a foul smelling lake (the Dead Sea), is on a route that is easily accessible until the present day. This is like the Ayah, ﴾وَإِنَّكُمْ لَّتَمُرُّونَ عَلَيْهِمْ مُّصْبِحِينَ - وَبِالَّيْلِ أَفَلاَ تَعْقِلُونَ ﴿ (Verily, you pass by them in the morning, and at night. Will you not then reflect) (37:137-138). ﴾إِنَّ فِى ذَلِكَ لآيَةً لِلْمُؤْمِنِينَ ﴿ (Surely, there is indeed a sign in that for the believers.) meaning, `All that We did to the people of Lut, from the destruction and the vengeance, to how We saved Lut and his family, these are clear signs to those who believe in Allah and His Messengers.' "

  15,79,"<h2>The Destruction of the Dwellers of Al-Aykah, the People of Shu`ayb</h2> The Dwellers of Al-Aykah, were the people of Shu`ayb. Ad-Dahhak, Qatadah and others said that Al-Aykah refers to intertwined trees. Their evildoing included associating partners with Allah (Shirk), banditry and cheating in weights and measures. Allah punished them with the Sayhah (the awful cry or torment), the earthquake, and the torment of the Day of Shadow. They lived near the people of Lut, but at a later time, and the people of Lut were known to them, which is why Allah says, ﴾وَإِنَّهُمَا لَبِإِمَامٍ مُّبِينٍ﴿ (They are both on an open route, plain to see.) Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Ad-Dahhak and others said, \"a visible route.\" This is why, when Shu`ayb warned his people, he said to them, ﴾وَمَا قَوْمُ لُوطٍ مِّنكُم بِبَعِيدٍ﴿ (And the people of Lut are not far off from you!) 11:89 "

  15,84,"<h2>The Destruction of the Dwellers of Al-Hijr, Who are the People called Thamud</h2> The Dwellers of the Al Hijr were the people of Thamud who rejected their Prophet, Salih. Whoever denies even one Messenger, then he has disbelieved in all of the Messengers, thus they are described as rejecting \"the Messengers\". Allah tells us that he (Salih) brought them signs to prove that what he was telling them was true, such as the she-camel which Allah created for them out of a solid rock in response to the supplication of Salih. This she-camel was grazing on their lands, and the people and the camel took water on alternate days that were well-known. When they rebelled and killed it, he said to them,  تَمَتَّعُواْ فِى دَارِكُمْ ثَلَـثَةَ أَيَّامٍ ذلِكَ وَعْدٌ غَيْرُ مَكْذُوبٍ  (\"Enjoy yourselves in your homes for three days. This is a promise which will not be belied.\") 11:65 Allah said:  وَأَمَّا ثَمُودُ فَهَدَيْنَـهُمْ فَاسْتَحَبُّواْ الْعَمَى عَلَى الْهُدَى  (And as for Thamud, We showed them and made the path of truth clear but they preferred blindness to guidance.) 41:17 Allah tells us that,  وَكَانُواْ يَنْحِتُونَ مِنَ الْجِبَالِ بُيُوتًا ءَامِنِينَ  (And they used to hew out dwellings from the mountains, (feeling) secure. ) meaning, they were without fear and they had no real need for those houses; it was merely a form of extravagance and work without a purpose. This could be seen from their work in the houses in the Al-Hijr through which the Messenger of Allah ﷺ passed on his way to Tabuk. He covered his head and urged his camel to go faster, saying to his Companions:  «لَا تَدْخُلُوا بُيُوتَ الْقَوْمِ الْمُعَذَّبِينَ إِلَّا أَنْ تَكُونُوا بَاكِينَ، فَإِنَّ لَمْ تَبْكُوا فَتَبَاكُوا خَشْيَةَ أَنْ يُصِيبَكُمْ مَا أَصَابَهُم»  (Do not enter the dwellings of those who were punished unless you are weeping, and if you do not weep then make yourself weep out of fear that perhaps what struck them may also strike you.)  فَأَخَذَتْهُمُ الصَّيْحَةُ مُصْبِحِينَ  (But the Sayhah (torment - awful cry) overtook them in the early morning.) meaning in the morning of the fourth day.  فَمَآ أَغْنَى عَنْهُمْ مَّا كَانُواْ يَكْسِبُونَ  (And all that they used to earn availed them not.) meaning all of the benefits that they used to gain from their crops and fruits, and the water which they did not want to share with the she-camel that they killed so that it would not reduce their share of the water - all of that wealth would not protect them or help them when the command of their Lord came to pass.  وَمَا خَلَقْنَا السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضَ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَآ إِلاَّ بِالْحَقِّ وَإِنَّ السَّاعَةَ لآتِيَةٌ فَاصْفَحِ الصَّفْحَ الْجَمِيلَ "
  15,85,"1888"
  15,86,"<h2>The World has been created for some Purpose, then the Hour will come</h2> Allah says, ﴾وَمَا خَلَقْنَا السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضَ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَآ إِلاَّ بِالْحَقِّ وَإِنَّ السَّاعَةَ لآتِيَةٌ﴿ (And We did not create the heavens and the earth and all that is between them except with the truth, and the Hour is surely coming), i.e., with justice to - ﴾لِيَجْزِىَ الَّذِينَ أَسَاءُواْ بِمَا عَمِلُواْ﴿ (requite those who do evil with that which they have done) 53:31 Allah says, ﴾وَمَا خَلَقْنَا السَّمَآءَ وَالاٌّرْضَ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَا بَـطِلاً ذَلِكَ ظَنُّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ فَوَيْلٌ لِّلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ مِنَ النَّارِ ﴿ (And We did not create the heaven and the earth, and all that is between them without purpose! That is what those who disbelieve think! Then let those who disbelieve be warned of the Fire!)(38:27) ﴾أَفَحَسِبْتُمْ أَنَّمَا خَلَقْنَـكُمْ عَبَثاً وَأَنَّكُمْ إِلَيْنَا لاَ تُرْجَعُونَ - فَتَعَـلَى اللَّهُ الْمَلِكُ الْحَقُّ لاَ إِلَـهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ رَبُّ الْعَرْشِ الْكَرِيمِ ﴿ (\"Did you think that We created you in play, and that you would not be brought back to Us\" So exalted be Allah, the Truth, the King, none has the right to be worshipped but He, the Lord of the Honored Throne!)(23:115-116). Then Allah informed His Prophet about the Hour, and that it will be the faults of the idolators when they insult him and reject the Message that he brings to them. This is like the Ayah, ﴾فَاصْفَحْ عَنْهُمْ وَقُلْ سَلَـمٌ فَسَوْفَ يَعْلَمُونَ ﴿ (So turn away from them, and say: \"Salam (Peace!).\" But they will come to know) (43:89). Mujahid, Qatadah and others said: \"This was before fighting was prescribed\". It is as they said, because this Surah was revealed in Makkah and fighting was prescribed after the Hijrah. ﴾إِنَّ رَبَّكَ هُوَ الْخَلَّـقُ الْعَلِيمُ ﴿ (Verily, your Lord is the Knowing Creator)(15:86). This is a confirmation of the Day of Resurrection and that Allah, may He be exalted, is able to bring the Hour to pass. He is the Creator and nothing is beyond Him. He is the Knowing, Who knows what has been dispersed from people's bodies and scattered throughout the regions of the earth, as He says: ﴾أَوَلَـيْسَ الَذِى خَلَقَ السَّمَـوتِ وَالاٌّرْضَ بِقَـدِرٍ عَلَى أَن يَخْلُقَ مِثْلَهُم بَلَى وَهُوَ الْخَلَّـقُ الْعَلِيمُ - إِنَّمَآ أَمْرُهُ إِذَآ أَرَادَ شَيْئاً أَن يَقُولَ لَهُ كُن فَيَكُونُ - فَسُبْحَـنَ الَّذِى بِيَدِهِ مَلَكُوتُ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ وَإِلَيْهِ تُرْجَعُونَ ﴿ (Is not He, Who created the heavens and the earth able to create the like of them Yes, indeed! He is the Knowing, Creator. Verily, His command, when He intends a thing, is only that He says to it, \"Be!\" - and it is! So glorified and exalted is He above all that they associate with Him, and in whose Hands is the dominion of all things, and to Him you shall return.)(36:81-83). "

  15,88,"<h2>A Reminder of the Blessing of the Qur'an and the Command to focus on its Message</h2> Allah is saying to His Prophet : Since We have given you the Grand Qur'an, then do not look at this world and its attractions, or the transient delights that we have given to its people in order to test them. Do not envy what they have in this world, and do not upset yourself with regret for their rejection of you and their opposition to your religion.  وَاخْفِضْ جَنَاحَكَ لِمَنِ اتَّبَعَكَ مِنَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ  (And lower your wings to the believers who follow you) (26:215) meaning - be gentle with them, like the Ayah,  لَقَدْ جَآءَكُمْ رَسُولٌ مِّنْ أَنفُسِكُمْ عَزِيزٌ عَلَيْهِ مَا عَنِتُّمْ حَرِيصٌ عَلَيْكُمْ بِالْمُؤْمِنِينَ رَءُوفٌ رَّحِيمٌ  (Verily, there has come unto you a Messenger from among yourselves. It grieves him that you should receive any injury or difficulty. He is anxious for you, for the believers - he is full of pity, kind and merciful)(9:128). There were some differences among the scholars over the meaning of \"seven of the Mathani\". Ibn Mas`ud, Ibn `Umar, Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Ad-Dahhak and others said that they are the seven long (Surahs), meaning Al-Baqarah, Al- `Imran, An-Nisa', Al-Ma'idah, Al-An`am, Al-A`raf and Yunus. There are texts to this effect reported from Ibn `Abbas and Sa`id bin Jubayr. Sa`id said: \"In them, Allah explains the obligations, the Hudud (legal limits), stories and rulings.\" Ibn `Abbas said, \"He explains the parables, stories and lessons.\" The second opinion is that they (the seven of the Mathani) are Al-Fatihah, which is composed of seven Ayat. This was reported from `Ali, `Umar, Ibn Mas`ud and Ibn `Abbas. Ibn `Abbas said: \"The Bismillah, is completing seven Ayah, which Allah has given exclusively to you (Muslims).\" This is also the opinion of Ibrahim An-Nakha`i, `Abdullah bin `Umayr, Ibn Abi Mulaykah, Shahr bin Hawshab, Al-Hasan Al-Basri and Mujahid. Al-Bukhari, may Allah have mercy on him, recorded two Hadiths on this topic. (The first) was recorded from Abu Sa`id bin Al-Mu`alla, who said: \"The Prophet passed by me while I was praying. He called out for me but I did not come until I finished my prayer. Then I came to him, and He asked,  «مَا مَنَعَكَ أَنْ تَأْتِيَنِي؟»  (What stopped you from coming to me) I said, `I was praying'. He said,  «أَلَمْ يَقُلِ اللهُ (`Did not Allah say  يأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ اسْتَجِيبُواْ لِلَّهِ وَلِلرَّسُولِ إِذَا دَعَاكُمْ  (O you who believe! Answer Allah (by obeying Him) and (His) Messenger when he calls you...) 8:24  أَلَا أُعَلِّمُكَ أَعْظَمَ سُورَةٍ فِي الْقُرْآنِ قَبْلَ أَنْ أَخْرُجَ مِنَ الْمَسْجِد»  (Shall I not teach you the most magnificent Surah before I leave the Masjid) Then the Prophet went to leave the Masjid, and I reminded him, so he said,  الْحَمْدُ للَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ  (\"Al-Hamdu Lillahi Rabbil-'Alamin All praises and thanks be to Allah, the Lord of all that exists)(1:2).  هِيَ السَّبْعُ الْمَثَانِي وَالْقُرْآنُ الَّذِي أُوتِيتُه»  (This is the seven of the Mathani and the Qur'an which I have been given.)\" (The second Hadith) was reported from Abu Hurayrah who said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:  «أُمُّ الْقُرْآنِ هِيَ السَّبْعُ الْمَثَانِي وَالْقُرْآنُ الْعَظِيم»  (Umm Al-Qur'an (the Mother or the Essence of the Qur'an,) is the seven Mathani, and the Grand Qur'an.) This means that Al-Fatihah is the seven Mathani and the Grand Qur'an, but this does not contradict the statement that the seven Mathani are the seven long Surahs, because they also share these attributes, as does the whole Qur'an. As Allah says,  اللَّهُ نَزَّلَ أَحْسَنَ الْحَدِيثِ كِتَـباً مُّتَشَـبِهاً مَّثَانِيَ  (Allah has sent down the best statement, a Book (this Qur'an), its parts resembling each other in goodness and truth, oft-recited) (39:23). So it is oft-recited in one way, and its parts resemble one another in another way, and this is also the Grand Qur'an.  لاَ تَمُدَّنَّ عَيْنَيْكَ إِلَى مَا مَتَّعْنَا بِهِ أَزْوَاجًا مِّنْهُمْ  (Look not with your eyes ambitiously at what We have given to certain classes of them) 20: 131 meaning, be content with the Grand Qur'an that Allah has given to you, and do not long for the luxuries and transient delights that they have.  لاَ تَمُدَّنَّ عَيْنَيْكَ  (Look not with your eyes ambitiously) Al-`Awfi reported that Ibn `Abbas said: \"He in this Ayah forbade a man to wish for what his companion has.\"  إِلَى مَا مَتَّعْنَا بِهِ أَزْوَاجًا مِّنْهُمْ  (at what We have given to certain classes of them,) Mujahid said: \"This refers to the rich.\" "
