tafsir[7]{c,v,t}:

  11,83,"<h2>The Town of Lut's People is overturned and Their Destruction</h2> Allah, the Exalted, says,  ﴾فَلَمَّا جَآءَ أَمْرُنَا﴿ (So when Our commandment came,) This happened at sunrise.  ﴾جَعَلْنَا عَـلِيَهَا﴿ (We turned it...) The city of Sadum (Sodom)  ﴾سَافِلَهَا﴿ (upside down,) This is similar to Allah's statement,  ﴾فَغَشَّـهَا مَا غَشَّى ﴿ (So there covered them that which did cover (torment with stones).)53:54 This means, \"We rained upon it with stones made of Sijjil.\" Sijjil is a Persian word meaning stones made of clay. This definition has been mentioned by Ibn `Abbas and others. Some of the scholars said that it (Sijjil) derived from the word Sang, which means a stone. Some others said it means Wakil, which is clay. In another verse Allah says,  ﴾حِجَارَةً مِّن طِينٍ﴿ (the stones of clay,) This means clay made into strong, hard stone. Some of the scholars said it means baked clay. Al-Bukhari said, \"Sijjil means that which is big and strong.\" Concerning Allah's statement,  ﴾مَّنْضُودٍ﴿ (in an array. ) Some of the scholars said that Mandud means the stones were arranged in the heavens and prepared for that (destruction). Others said,  ﴾مَّنْضُودٍ﴿ (in an array.) This word means that some of them (the stones) followed others in their descent upon the people of Lut. Concerning the statement,  ﴾مُّسَوَّمَةً﴿ (Marked) meaning the stones were marked and sealed, all of them having the names of their victims written on them. Qatadah and `Ikrimah both said, \"Musawwamah means each stone was encompassed by a sprinkling of red coloring.\" The commentators have mentioned that it (the shower of stones) descended upon the people of the town and upon the various villages around it. One of them would be speaking with some people when a stone would strike him from the sky and kill him while he was among the people. Thus, the stones followed them, striking the people in the entire land until they destroyed them all. Not a single one of them remained. Concerning Allah's statement,  ﴾وَمَا هِى مِنَ الظَّـلِمِينَ بِبَعِيدٍ﴿ (and they are not ever far from the wrongdoers.) This means that this vengeance (of Allah) is not far from similar wrongdoers. Verily, it has been reported in a Hadith of the Sunan collections, from Ibn `Abbas, which he attributed to the Prophet ,  ﴾«مَنْ وَجَدْتُمُوهُ يَعْمَلُ عَمَلَ قَوْمِ لُوطٍ فَاقْتُلُوا الْفَاعِلَ وَالْمَفْعُولَ بِه»﴿ (Whoever you find doing the deed of Lut's people homosexuality, then kill the doer and the one who allows it to be done to him (both partners).)  "
  11,84,"<h2>The Story of the People of Madyan and the Call of Shu`ayb</h2> Allah, the Exalted, says, `We sent a Messenger to the people of Madyan.' They were a tribe of Arabs who lived between the land of the Al-Hijaz and Ash-Sham, close to the land of Ma`an. Their land was known by the name of their tribe and was thus, called Madyan. Allah sent unto them the Prophet Shu`ayb and he was of the noblest of them in lineage. For this reason, Allah said,  ﴾أَخَاهُمْ شُعَيْبًا﴿ (their brother Shu`ayb.) Shu`ayb commanded them to worship Allah alone without associating any partners with him. He also prohibited them from cheating in their weights and measures (for business transactions).  ﴾إِنِّى أَرَاكُمْ بِخَيْرٍ﴿ (I see you in prosperity) meaning, `in your livelihood and your provisions. And verily, I fear that you will be deprived of this bounty that you are enjoying by violating Allah's prohibitions.'  ﴾وَإِنِّى أَخَافُ عَلَيْكُمْ عَذَابَ يَوْمٍ مُّحِيطٍ﴿ (and verily, I fear for you the torment of a Day encompassing.) This means the abode of the Hereafter.  "

  11,86," First, he (Shu`ayb) prohibited them from cheating in business by decreasing the weights whenever they gave (products) to people.   He commanded them to give just measure and weight whether they were giving or receiving (in transactions). He also forbade them from causing mischief and corruption in the land. This was due to their practice of highway robbery along the roads. Abu Ja`far bin Jarir said,  ﴾بَقِيَّتُ اللَّهِ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ﴿ (That which is left by Allah (after giving the rights of the people) is better for you,) \"This means what you gain from your successful business dealings in which you have given just measure, is better for you than wrongfully taking the wealth of the people.\" Ibn Jarir said that this statement has been reported from Ibn `Abbas and I say it is similar to Allah's statement,  ﴾قُل لاَّ يَسْتَوِى الْخَبِيثُ وَالطَّيِّبُ وَلَوْ أَعْجَبَكَ كَثْرَةُ الْخَبِيثِ﴿ (Say: \"Not equal are Khabith (all that is evil) and Tayyib (all that is good), even though the abundance of Khabith may please you.\")5:100 Allah then says,  ﴾وَمَآ أَنَاْ عَلَيْكُمْ بِحَفِيظٍ﴿ (And I am not a guardian over you.) This means a watcher over you people. In other words, \"Do this for Allah and not to be seen by the people.\"  "
  11,87,"<h2>The Response of Shu`ayb's People</h2> They said to Shu`ayb, in mockery,  ﴾أَصَلَوَتُكَ﴿ (Does your Salah) Al-A`mash said, \"This means your reading.\"  ﴾تَأْمُرُكَ أَن نَّتْرُكَ مَا يَعْبُدُ ءابَاؤُنَآ﴿ (command you that we give up what our fathers used to worship,) meaning the idols and statues.  ﴾أَوْ أَن نَّفْعَلَ فِى أَمْوَالِنَا مَا نَشَؤُا﴿ (or that we give up doing what we like with our property) This means, \"Should we abandon our practice of lightening the scales because of your statement This is our wealth and we will do with it as we please.\" Al-Hasan said concerning Allah's statement,  ﴾أَصَلَوَتُكَ تَأْمُرُكَ أَن نَّتْرُكَ مَا يَعْبُدُ ءابَاؤُنَآ﴿ (Does your Salah command you that we give up what our fathers used to worship,)11:87 \"By Allah, this means that his prayer commanded them to abandon what their fathers used to worship.\" At-Thawri said concerning Allah's statement,  ﴾أَوْ أَن نَّفْعَلَ فِى أَمْوَالِنَا مَا نَشَؤُا﴿ (or that we give up doing what we like with our property) \"They were speaking in reference to the paying of Zakah (charity). \"  ﴾إِنَّكَ لاّنتَ الْحَلِيمُ الرَّشِيدُ﴿ (Verily, you are the forbearer right-minded!) Ibn `Abbas, Maymun bin Mihran, Ibn Jurayj, Ibn Aslam, and Ibn Jarir all said, \"These enemies of Allah were only saying this in mockery. May Allah disfigure them and curse them from ever receiving His mercy. And verily, He did so.\"  "
  11,88,"<h2>Shu`ayb's Refutation of His People</h2> He said to them: Do you see O my people, that if I  ﴾عَلَى بَيِّنَةٍ مِّن رَّبِّى﴿ (have a clear evidence from my Lord) meaning, upon clear guidance in that which I am calling to.  ﴾وَرَزَقَنِى مِنْهُ رِزْقًا حَسَنًا﴿ (and He has given me a good sustenance from Himself.) It has been said that he meant the prophethood. It has also been said that he meant the lawful provisions. It seems that the verse carries both meanings. Ath-Thawri said,  ﴾وَمَآ أُرِيدُ أَنْ أُخَالِفَكُمْ إِلَى مَآ أَنْهَـكُمْ عَنْهُ﴿ (I wish not, in contradiction to you, to do that which I forbid you.) meaning, `do not forbid you from something and at the same time I contradict my prohibitions in secret behind your backs, doing what I have forbidden.' This is similar to what Qatadah said concerning Allah's statement,  ﴾وَمَآ أُرِيدُ أَنْ أُخَالِفَكُمْ إِلَى مَآ أَنْهَـكُمْ عَنْهُ﴿ (I wish not, in contradiction to you, to do that which I forbid you.) \"He is saying, `I do not forbid you all from something while I do it myself.\"'  ﴾إِنْ أُرِيدُ إِلاَّ الإِصْلَـحَ مَا اسْتَطَعْتُ﴿ (I only desire reform to the best of my power.) This means, \"In that which I command and forbid you, I only want to correct your affair as much as I am able.\"  ﴾وَمَا تَوْفِيقِى﴿ (And my guidance cannot come) This means, \"In whatever I intend that agrees with the truth.\"  ﴾إِلاَّ بِاللَّهِ عَلَيْهِ تَوَكَّلْتُ﴿ (except from Allah, in Him I put my trust) This means in all of my affairs.  ﴾وَإِلَيْهِ أُنِيبُ﴿ (and unto Him I repent.) meaning; \"I return.\" This has been said by Mujahid and others.
