tafsir[8]{c,v,t}:
  18,54,"<h2>Examples put forth in the Qur'an</h2> Allah says, `In this Qur'an, We have explained to mankind and given clear details of matters so that they will not stray from the truth or be misled from the path of guidance. Despite this explanation, man is very quarrelsome and opposes truth with falsehood,' except for those whom Allah guides to the path of salvation. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Ali bin Abi Talib said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ came to visit him and Fatimah, the daughter of Allah's Messenger ﷺ at night, and said,  «أَلَا تُصَلِّيَانِ؟»  (Are you not going to pray) I said, \"O Messenger of Allah, our souls are in the Hand of Allah. If He wills to wake us, He will wake us.\" When I said that, he went away without returning. Then I heard him as he was walking away, slapping his thigh and saying,  وَكَانَ الإِنْسَـنُ أَكْثَرَ شَىءٍ جَدَلاً  (But, man is ever more quarrelsome than anything.)\" It was also recorded in the Two Sahihs. "

  18,56,"<h2>The Rebellion of the Disbelievers</h2> Allah tells us about the rebellion of the disbelievers in ancient times and in more recent times, and how they rejected the obvious truth even when they witnessed clear signs and proofs. Nothing stopped them from following the truth except their demand to witness with their own eyes the punishment which they were being warned about. As some of them said to their Prophet:  فَأَسْقِطْ عَلَيْنَا كِسَفاً مِّنَ السَّمَآءِ إِن كُنتَ مِنَ الصَّـدِقِينَ  (So cause a piece of the heaven to fall on us, if you are of the truthful!) 26:187, Others said:  ائْتِنَا بِعَذَابِ اللَّهِ إِن كُنتَ مِنَ الصَّـدِقِينَ  (Bring Allah's torment upon us if you are one of the truthful.) 29:29 The Quraysh said:  اللَّهُمَّ إِن كَانَ هَـذَا هُوَ الْحَقَّ مِنْ عِندِكَ فَأَمْطِرْ عَلَيْنَا حِجَارَةً مِّنَ السَّمَآءِ أَوِ ائْتِنَا بِعَذَابٍ أَلِيمٍ  (O Allah! If this is indeed the truth from You, then rain down stones on us from the sky or bring upon us a painful torment.) 8:32  وَقَالُواْ يأَيُّهَا الَّذِى نُزِّلَ عَلَيْهِ الذِّكْرُ إِنَّكَ لَمَجْنُونٌ - لَّوْ مَا تَأْتِينَا بِالْمَلَـئِكَةِ إِن كُنتَ مِنَ الصَّـدِقِينَ  (And they say: \"O you to whom the Reminder has been sent down! Verily, you are a mad man! Why do you not bring angels to us if you are of the truthful\") 15:6-7. There are other Ayat refering to the same thing. Then Allah says:  إِلاَّ أَن تَأْتِيَهُمْ سُنَّةُ الاٌّوَّلِينَ  (except that the ways of the ancients be repeated with them,) meaning, their overwhelming punishment, destroying every last one of them.  أَوْ يَأْتِيَهُمُ الْعَذَابُ قُبُلاً  (or the torment be brought to them face to face.) they see it with their own eyes, being directly confronted with it. Then Allah says:  وَمَا نُرْسِلُ الْمُرْسَلِينَ إِلاَّ مُبَشِّرِينَ وَمُنذِرِينَ  (And We send not the Messengers except as bearers of good news and warners.) before the punishment they give good news to those who believe in them and follow them, and warnings to those who reject them and oppose them. Then Allah tells us about the disbelievers who argue:  بِالْبَـطِلِ لِيُدْحِضُواْ بِهِ الْحَقَّ  (with falsehood, in order to refute the truth thereby.) they try to weaken the truth that the Messengers brought, but they cannot achieve that.  وَاتَّخَذُواْ ءايَاتِى وَمَا أُنْذِرُواْ هُزُواً  (And they take My Ayat and that which they are warned for jest!) they take the proof, evidence and miracles sent with the Messengers to warn them, and make them fear the punishment;  هُزُواً  (as a jest and mockery) and they make fun of them, which is the worst type of disbelief.  وَمَنْ أَظْلَمُ مِمَّن ذُكِّرَ بِـَايِـتِ رَبِّهِ فَأَعْرَضَ عَنْهَا وَنَسِىَ مَا قَدَّمَتْ يَدَاهُ إِنَّا جَعَلْنَا عَلَى قُلُوبِهِمْ أَكِنَّةً أَن يَفْقَهُوهُ وَفِى ءَاذَانِهِمْ وَقْراً وَإِن تَدْعُهُمْ إِلَى الْهُدَى فَلَنْ يَهْتَدُواْ إِذاً أَبَداً - وَرَبُّكَ الْغَفُورُ ذُو الرَّحْمَةِ لَوْ يُؤَاخِذُهُم بِمَا كَسَبُواْ لَعَجَّلَ لَهُمُ الْعَذَابَ بَل لَّهُم مَّوْعِدٌ لَّن يَجِدُواْ مِن دُونِهِ مَوْئِلاً "

  18,59,"<h2>The Worst People are Those Who turn away after being reminded</h2> Allah says, `Who among My creatures does more wrong than one who is reminded of the signs of Allah then turns away from them,' i.e., ignores them and does not listen or pay attention to them. ﴾وَنَسِىَ مَا قَدَّمَتْ يَدَاهُ﴿ (forgetting what his hands have sent forth.) means, bad deeds and evil actions. ﴾إِنَّا جَعَلْنَا عَلَى قُلُوبِهِمْ﴿ (Truly, We have set over their hearts) means, the hearts of these people, ﴾أَكِنَّةً﴿ (Akinnah) means, coverings. ﴾أَن يَفْقَهُوهُ﴿ (lest they should understand this,) means, so that they will not understand this Qur'an and its clear Message ﴾وَفِى ءَاذَانِهِمْ وَقْرًا﴿ (and in their ears, deafness.) means that they will be deaf in an abstract way, to guidance. ﴾وَإِن تَدْعُهُمْ إِلَى الْهُدَى فَلَنْ يَهْتَدُواْ إِذاً أَبَداً﴿ (And if you call them to guidance, even then they will never be guided.) ﴾وَرَبُّكَ الْغَفُورُ ذُو الرَّحْمَةِ﴿ (And your Lord is Most Forgiving, Owner of mercy.) means, `your Lord, O Muhammad, is forgiving and has great mercy.' ﴾لَوْ يُؤَاخِذُهُم بِمَا كَسَبُواْ لَعَجَّلَ لَهُمُ الْعَذَابَ﴿ (Were He to call them to account for what they have earned, then surely, He would have hastened their punishment.) This is like the Ayah: ﴾وَلَوْ يُؤَاخِذُ اللَّهُ النَّاسَ بِمَا كَسَبُواْ مَا تَرَكَ عَلَى ظَهْرِهَا مِن دَآبَّةٍ﴿ (And if Allah were to punish men for that which they earned, He would not leave a moving creature on the surface of the earth.) 35:45 ﴾وَإِنَّ رَبَّكَ لَذُو مَغْفِرَةٍ لِّلنَّاسِ عَلَى ظُلْمِهِمْ وَإِنَّ رَبَّكَ لَشَدِيدُ الْعِقَابِ﴿ (But verily, your Lord is full of forgiveness for mankind in spite of their wrongdoing. And verily, your Lord is (also) severe in punishment) 13:6. And there are many Ayat which say the same thing. Then Allah tells us that He is patient, He conceals faults and forgives sins. He may guide some of them from wrongdoing to true guidance, and whoever continues in his evil ways, then there will come to him a Day when infants will turn grey and every pregnant female will shed her load. He says: ﴾بَل لَّهُم مَّوْعِدٌ لَّن يَجِدُواْ مِن دُونِهِ مَوْئِلاً﴿ (But they have their appointed time, beyond which they will find no escape.) meaning, they will find no way out. ﴾وَتِلْكَ الْقُرَى أَهْلَكْنَـهُمْ لَمَّا ظَلَمُواْ﴿ (And these towns, We destroyed them when they did wrong.) This refers to earlier nations in times past; `We destroyed them because of their stubborn disbelief.' ﴾وَجَعَلْنَا لِمَهْلِكِهِم مَّوْعِدًا﴿ (And We appointed a fixed time for their destruction.) `We appointed for them a set time limit, not to be increased or decreased. The same applies to you, O ido- lators, so beware or what happened to them will happen to you too, for you have rejected the noblest Messenger and greatest Prophet, and you are not dearer to Us than them, so fear My punishment and wrath.'
