tafsir[5]{c,v,t}:
  8,41,"<h2>Ruling on the Spoils of War (Ghanimah and Fai )</h2> Allah explains the spoils of war in detail, as He has specifically allowed it for this honorable Ummah over all others. We should mention that the `Ghanimah' refers to war spoils captured from the disbelievers, using armies and instruments of war. As for `Fai', it refers to the property of the disbelievers that they forfeit in return for peace, what they leave behind when they die and have no one to inherit from them, and the Jizyah (tribute tax) and Khiraj (property tax). Allah said,  وَاعْلَمُوا أَنَّمَا غَنِمْتُم مِّن شَىْءٍ فَأَنَّ للَّهِ خُمُسَهُ  (And know that whatever of war booty that you may gain, verily, one-fifth of it is assigned to Allah) indicating that the one-fifth should be reserved and paid in full to Muslim leaders whether it was little or substantial, even a yarn and needle.  وَمَن يَغْلُلْ يَأْتِ بِمَا غَلَّ يَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ ثُمَّ تُوَفَّى كُلُّ نَفْسٍ مَّا كَسَبَتْ وَهُمْ لاَ يُظْلَمُونَ  (And whosoever deceives (his companions over the booty), he shall bring forth on the Day of Resurrection that which he took (illegally). Then every person shall be paid in full what he has earned, and they shall not be dealt with unjustly.) 3:161  Allah's statement,  فَأَنَّ للَّهِ خُمُسَهُ وَلِلرَّسُولِ  (verily, one-fifth of it is assigned to Allah, and to the Messenger, ) was explained by Ibn `Abbas, as Ad-Dahhak reported from him, \"Whenever the Messenger of Allah ﷺ sent an army, he used to divide the war booty they collected into five shares, reserving one-fifth and divided it into five shares.\" Then he recited;  وَاعْلَمُوا أَنَّمَا غَنِمْتُم مِّن شَىْءٍ فَأَنَّ للَّهِ خُمُسَهُ وَلِلرَّسُولِ  (And know that whatever of war booty that you may gain, verily, one-fifth of it is assigned to Allah, and to the Messenger,)  Ibn Abbas said, \"Allah's statement,  فَأَنَّ للَّهِ خُمُسَهُ  (verily, one-fifth of it is assigned to Allah) is inclusive of the Messenger's share, just as the following Ayah is inclusive of Allah owning whatever is on the earth also,  لِّلَّهِ مَا فِي السَّمَـوتِ وَمَا فِى الاٌّرْضِ  (To Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and on the earth)2:284.\" So He addressed the share of Allah and the share of His Messenger in the same statement.  Ibrahim An-Nakha`i, Al-Hasan bin Muhammad bin Al-Hanifiyyah, Al-Hasan Al-Basri, Ash-Sha`bi, `Ata' bin Abi Rabah, `Abdullah bin Buraydah, Qatadah, Mughirah and several others, all said that the share designated for Allah and the Messenger is one and the same. Supporting this is what Imam Al-Hafiz Abu Bakr Al-Bayhaqi recorded, with a Sahih chain of narrators, that `Abdullah bin Shaqiq said that a man from Bilqin said, \"I came to the Prophet when he was in Wadi Al-Qura inspecting a horse. I asked, `O Allah's Messenger! What about the Ghanimah' He said,  «للهِ خُمُسُهَا وَأَرْبَعَةُ أَخْمَاسِهَا لِلْجَيْش»  (Allah's share is one fifth and four-fifths are for the army.)  I asked, `None of them has more right to it than anyone else' He said,  «لَا، وَلَا السَّهْمُ تَسْتَخْرِجُهُ مِنْ جَنْبِكَ لَيْسَ أَنْتَ أَحَقَّ بِهِ مِنْ أَخِيكَ الْمُسْلِم»  (No. Even if you remove an arrow that pierced your flank, you have no more right to it than your Muslim brother.)\"  Imam Ahmad recorded that Al-Miqdam bin Ma`dikarib Al-Kindi sat with `Ubadah bin As-Samit, Abu Ad-Darda' and Al-Harith bin Mu`awiyah Al-Kindi, may Allah be pleased with them, reminding each other of the statements of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. Abu Ad-Darda' said to `Ubadah, \"O `Ubadah! What about the words of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ during such and such battle, about the fifth (of the war booty)\" `Ubadah said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ led them in prayer, facing a camel from the war booty. When he finished the prayer, he stood up, held pelt of a camel between his fingers and said,  «إِنَّ هَذِهِ مِنْ غَنَائِمِكُمْ وَإِنَّهُ لَيْسَ لِي فِيهَا إِلَّا نَصِيبِي مَعَكُمْ إِلَّا الْخُمُسُ، وَالْخُمُسُ مَرْدُودٌ عَلَيْكُمْ، فَأَدُّوا الْخَيْطَ وَالْمَخِيطَ، وَأَكْبَرَ مِنْ ذَلِكَ وَأَصْغَرَ، وَلَا تَغُلُّوا فَإِنَّ الْغُلُولَ نَارٌ وَعَارٌ عَلَى أَصْحَابِهِ فِي الدُّنْيَا وَالْآخِرَةِ، وَجَاهِدُوا النَّاسَ فِي اللهِ الْقَرِيبَ وَالْبَعِيدَ، وَلَا تُبَالُوا فِي اللهِ لَوْمَةَ لَائِمٍ، وَأَقِيمُوا حُدُودَ اللهِ فِي الْحَضَرِ وَالسَّفَرِ، وَجَاهِدُوا فِي سَبِيلِ اللهِ، فَإِنَّ الْجِهَادَ بَابٌ مِنْ أَبْوَابِ الْجَنَّةِ عَظِيمٌ، يُنْجِي بِهِ اللهُ مِنَ الْهَمِّ وَالْغَم»  (This is also a part of the war booty you earned. Verily, I have no share in it, except my own share, the fifth designated to me. Even that fifth will be given to you (indicating the Prophet's generosity). Therefore, surrender even the needle and the thread, and whatever is bigger or smaller than that (from the war spoils). Do not cheat with any of it, for stealing from the war booty before its distribution is Fire and a shame on its people in this life and the Hereafter. Perform Jihad against the people in Allah's cause, whether they are near or far, and do not fear the blame of the blamers, as long as you are in Allah's cause. Establish Allah's rules while in your area and while traveling. Perform Jihad in Allah's cause, for Jihad is a tremendous door leading to Paradise. Through it, Allah saves (one) from sadness and grief.)\"  This is a tremendous Hadith, but I did not find it in any of the six collections of Hadith through this chain of narration. However, Imam Ahmad, Abu Dawud and An-Nasa'i recorded a Hadith from `Amr bin Shu`ayb, from his father, from his grandfather `Abdullah bin `Amr, from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, and this narration is similar to the one above, and a version from `Amr bin `Anbasah was recorded by Abu Dawud and An-Nasa'i. The Prophet used to choose some types of the war booty for himself; a servant, a horse, or a sword, according to the reports from Muhammad bin Sirin, `Amir Ash-Sha`bi and many scholars. For instance, Imam Ahmad and At-Tirmidhi -- who graded it Hasan -- recorded from Ibn `Abbas that the Messenger ﷺ of Allah chose a sword called `Dhul-Fiqar' on the day of Badr. `A'ishah narrated that Safiyyah was among the captured women, and the Prophet chose and married her (upon his own choice and before distribution of war booty), as Abu Dawud narrated in the Sunan. As for the share of the Prophet's relatives, it is paid to Bani Hashim and Bani Al-Muttalib, because the children of Al-Muttalib supported Bani Hashim in Jahiliyyah after Islam. They also went to the mountain pass of Abu Talib in support of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and to protect him (when the Quraysh boycotted Muslims for three years). Those who were Muslims (from Bani Al-Muttalib) did all this in obedience to Allah and His Messenger , while the disbelievers among them did so in support of their tribe and in obedience to Abu Talib, the Messenger's uncle.  Allah said next,  وَالْيَتَـمَى  (the orphans), in reference to Muslim orphans,  وَابْنِ السَّبِيلِ  (and the wayfarer), the traveler and those who intend to travel for a distance during which shortening the prayer is legislated, but do not have resources to spend from. We will explain this subject in Surah Bara'h 9:60, Allah willing, and our reliance and trust is in Him alone.  Allah said,  إِن كُنتُمْ ءَامَنْتُم بِاللَّهِ وَمَآ أَنزَلْنَا عَلَى عَبْدِنَا  (If you have believed in Allah and in that which We sent down to Our servant)  Allah says, `Adhere to what We legislated for you, such as the ruling about one-fifth of the war spoils, if you truly believe in Allah, the Last Day and what We have revealed to Our Messenger .' In the Two Sahihs, it is recorded that `Abdullah bin `Abbas said, - while narrating the lengthy Hadith about the delegation of Bani Abdul Qays - that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to them, s  «وآمُرُكُمْ بِأَرْبَعٍ، وَأَنْهَاكُمْ عَنْ أَرْبَعٍ. آمُرُكُمْ بِالْإِيمَانِ بِاللهِ ثُمَّ قَالَ: هَلْ تَدْرُونَ مَا الْإِيمَــانُ بِاللهِ؟ شَهَــــادَةُ أَن لَّا إِلَهَ إِلَّا اللهُ، وَأَنَّ مُحَمَّدًا رَسُولُ اللهِ، وَإِقَامُ الصَّلَاةِ وَإِيتَاءُ الزَّكَاةِ، وَأن تُؤَدُّوا الْخُمُسَ مِنَ الْمَغْنَم»  I command you with four and forbid four from you. I command you to believe in Allah. Do you know what it means to believe in Allah Testifying that there is no deity worthy of worship except Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, establishing the prayer, giving Zakah and honestly surrendering one-fifth of the war spoils.)  Therefore, the Messenger listed surrendering one-fifth of the war booty as part of faith. This is why Al-Bukhari wrote a chapter in his Sahih entitled, \"Chapter: Paying the Khumus (one-fifth) is Part of Faith.\" He then narrated the above Hadith from Ibn `Abbas. Allah said next,  يَوْمَ الْفُرْقَانِ يَوْمَ الْتَقَى الْجَمْعَانِ وَاللَّهُ عَلَى كُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدِيرٌ  (on the Day of Criterion, the Day when the two forces met; and Allah is Able to do all things.) Allah is making His favors and compassion towards His creation known, when He distinguished between truth and falsehood in the battle of Badr. That day was called, `Al-Furqan', because Allah raised the word of faith above the word of falsehood, He made His religion apparent and supported His Prophet and his group. `Ali bin Abi Talhah and Al-`Awfi reported that Ibn `Abbas said, \"Badr is YawmAl-Furqan; during it, Allah separated between truth and falsehood.\" Al-Hakim collected this statement. Similar statements were reported from Mujahid, Miqsam, `Ubaydullah bin `Abdullah, Ad-Dahhak, Qatadah, Muqatil bin Hayyan and several others. "
  8,42,"<h2>Some Details of the Battle of Badr</h2> Allah describes Yawm Al-Furqan, (i.e. the day of Badr),  إِذْ أَنتُم بِالْعُدْوَةِ الدُّنْيَا  ((And remember) when you (the Muslim army) were on the near side of the valley,) camping in the closest entrance of the valley towards Al-Madinah,  وَهُمْ  (and they), the idolators, who were camped,  بِالْعُدْوَةِ الْقُصْوَى  (on the farther side), from Al-Madinah, towards Makkah.  وَالرَّكْبُ  (and the caravan), that was under the command of Abu Sufyan, with the wealth that it contained,  أَسْفَلَ مِنكُمْ  (on the ground lower than you), closer to the sea,  وَلَوْ تَوَاعَدتُّمْ  (even if you had made a mutual appointment to meet,) you and the idolators,  لاَخْتَلَفْتُمْ فِي الْمِيعَـدِ  (you would certainly have failed in the appointment)  Muhammad bin Ishaq said, \"Yahya bin `Abbad bin `Abdullah bin Az-Zubayr narrated to me from his father about this Ayah \"Had there been an appointed meeting set between you and them and you came to know of their superior numbers and your few forces, you would not have met them,  وَلَـكِن لِّيَقْضِيَ اللَّهُ أَمْراً كَانَ مَفْعُولاً  (but (you met) that Allah might accomplish a matter already ordained,) Allah had decreed that He would bring glory to Islam and its people, while disgracing Shirk and its people. You the companions had no knowledge this would happen, but it was out of Allah's compassion that He did that.\" In a Hadith, Ka`b bin Malik said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ and the Muslims marched to intercept the Quraysh caravan, but Allah made them meet their (armed) enemy without appointment.\" Muhammad bin Ishaq said that Yazid bin Ruwman narrated to him that `Urwah bin Az-Zubayr said, \"Upon approaching Badr, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ sent `Ali bin Abi Talib, Sa`d bin Abi Waqqas, Az-Zubayr bin Al-`Awwam and several other Companions to spy the pagans. They captured two boys, a servant of Bani Sa`id bin Al-`As and a servant of Bani Al-Hajjaj, while they were bringing water for Quraysh. So they brought them to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, but found him praying. The Companions started interrogating the boys, asking them to whom they belonged. Both of them said that they were employees bringing water for Quraysh (army). The Componions were upset with that answer, since they thought that the boys belonged to Abu Sufyan (who was commanding the caravan). So they beat the two boys vehemently, who said finally that they belonged to Abu Sufyan. Thereupon companions left them alone. When the Prophet ended the prayer, he said,  «إَذَا صَدَّقَاكُمْ ضَرَبْتُمُوهُمَا، وَإِذَا كَذَّبَاكُمْ تَرَكْتُمُوهُمَا، صَدَقَا وَاللهِ إِنَّهُمَا لِقُرَيْشٍ ، أَخْبِرَانِي عَنْ قُرَيْش»  (When they tell you the truth you beat them, but when they lie you let them go They have said the truth, by Allah! They belong to the Quraysh. (addressing to the boys He said:) Tell me the news about Quraysh.)  The two boys said, `They are behind this hill that you see, on the far side of the valley.' The Messenger of Allah ﷺ asked,  «كَمِ الْقَوْمُ؟»  (How many are they)  They said, `They are many.' He asked,  «مَاعُدَّتُهُمْ؟»  (How many) They said, `We do not know the precise number.' He asked,  «كَمْ يَنْحَرُونَ كُلَّ يَوْمٍ؟»  (How many camels do they slaughter every day)  They said, `Nine or ten a day.' The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,  «الْقَوْمُ مَا بَيْنَ التِّسْعمِائَةِ إِلَى الْأَلْف»  (They are between nine-hundred and a thousand.) He asked again,  «فَمَنْ فِيهِمْ مِنْ أَشْرَافِ قُرَيْشٍ؟»  (Which chiefs of Quraysh are accompanying the army) They said, `Utbah bin Rabi`ah, Shaybah bin Rabi`ah, Abu Al-Bakhtari bin Hisham, Hakim bin Hizam, Nawfal bin Khuwaylid, Al-Harith bin `Amir bin Nawfal, Tu`aymah bin Adi bin Nawfal, An-Nadr bin Al-Harith, Zam`ah bin Al-Aswad, Abu Jahl bin Hisham, Umayyah bin Khalaf, Nabih and Munabbih sons of Al-Hajjaj, Suhayl bin `Amr and `Amr bin `Abd Wadd.' The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to the people,  «هَذِهِ مَكَّةُ قَدْ أَلْقَتْ إِلَيْكُمْ أَفَلَاذَ كَبِدِهَا»  (This is Makkah! She has brought you her most precious sons (its chiefs)!)\"  Allah said,  لِّيَهْلِكَ مَنْ هَلَكَ عَن بَيِّنَةٍ وَيَحْيَى مَنْ حَىَّ عَن بَيِّنَةٍ  (So that those who were to be destroyed might be destroyed after a clear evidence.) 8:42  Muhammad bin Ishaq commented, \"So that those who disbelieve do so after witnessing clear evidence, proof and lessons, and those who believe do so after witnessing the same.\" This is a sound explanation. Allah says, He made you meet your enemy in one area without appointment, so that He gives you victory over them.' This way, `He will raise the word of truth above falsehood, so that the matter is made clear, the proof unequivocal and the evidence plain. Then there will be no more plea or doubt for anyone. Then, those destined to destruction by persisting in disbelief do so with evidence, aware that they are misguided and that proof has been established against them,  وَيَحْيَى مَنْ حَىَّ  (and those who were to live might live), those who wish to believe do so,  عَن بَيِّنَةٍ  (after a clear evidence), and proof. Verily, faith is the life of the heart, as Allah said,  أَوَمَن كَانَ مَيْتًا فَأَحْيَيْنَـهُ وَجَعَلْنَا لَهُ نُورًا يَمْشِي بِهِ فِى النَّاسِ كَمَن  (Is he who was dead (without faith by ignorance and disbelief) and We gave him life (by knowledge and faith) and set for him a light (of belief) whereby he can walk among men ...) 6:122.  Allah said next,  وَإِنَّ اللَّهَ لَسَمِيعٌ  (And surely, Allah is All-Hearer), of your invocation, humility and requests for His help,  عَلِيمٌ  (All-Knower) meaning; about you, and you deserve victory over your rebellious, disbelieving enemies. "

  8,44,"<h2>Allah made each Group look few in the Eye of the Other</h2> Mujahid said, \"In a dream, Allah showed the Prophet the enemy as few. The Prophet conveyed this news to his Companions and their resolve strengthened.\" Similar was said by Ibn Ishaq and several others. Allah said,  ﴾وَلَوْ أَرَاكَهُمْ كَثِيراً لَّفَشِلْتُمْ﴿ (If He had shown them to you as many, you would surely, have been discouraged,) you would have cowardly abstained from meeting them and fell in dispute among yourselves,  ﴾وَلَـكِنَّ اللَّهَ سَلَّمَ﴿ (But Allah saved), from all this, when He made you see them as few,  ﴾إِنَّهُ عَلِيمٌ بِذَاتِ الصُّدُورِ﴿ (Certainly, He is the All-Knower of that is in the breasts.) 8:43.   Allah knows what the heart and the inner-self conceal,  ﴾يَعْلَمُ خَآئِنَةَ الاٌّعْيُنِ وَمَا تُخْفِى الصُّدُورُ ﴿ (Allah knows the fraud of the eyes, and all that the breasts conceal) 40:19.   Allah's statement,  ﴾وَإِذْ يُرِيكُمُوهُمْ إِذِ الْتَقَيْتُمْ فِى أَعْيُنِكُمْ قَلِيلاً﴿ (And (remember) when you met, He showed them to you as few in your eyes) demonstrates Allah's compassion towards the believers. Allah made them see few disbelievers in their eyes, so that they would be encouraged and feel eager to meet them. Abu Ishaq As-Subai`i said, that Abu `Ubaydah said that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"They were made to seem few in our eyes during Badr, so that I said to a man who was next to me, `Do you think they are seventy' He said, `Rather, they are a hundred.' However, when we captured one of them, we asked him and he said, `We were a thousand.\"' Ibn Abi Hatim and Ibn Jarir recorded it. Allah said next,  ﴾وَيُقَلِّلُكُمْ فِى أَعْيُنِهِمْ﴿ (and He made you appear as few in their eyes,) Allah said,  ﴾وَإِذْ يُرِيكُمُوهُمْ إِذِ الْتَقَيْتُمْ﴿ (And (remember) when you met. He showed them to you...), He encouraged each of the two groups against the other, according to `Ikrimah, as recorded by Ibn Abi Hatim. This statement has a Sahih chain of narrators. Muhammad bin Ishaq said that Yahya bin `Abbad bin `Abdullah bin Az-Zubayr narrated to him that his father said about Allah's statement,  ﴾لِّيَقْضِيَ اللَّهُ أَمْراً كَانَ مَفْعُولاً﴿ (so that Allah might accomplish a matter already ordained, ) \"In order for the war to start between them, so that He would have revenge against those whom He decided to have revenge (pagans), and grant and complete His favor upon those He decided to grant favor to, His supporters.\" The meaning of this, is that Allah encouraged each group against the other and made them look few in each other's eyes, so that they were eager to meet them. This occurred before the battle started, but when it started and Allah supported the believers with a thousand angels in succession, the disbelieving group saw the believers double their number. Allah said,  ﴾قَدْ كَانَ لَكُمْ ءَايَةٌ فِي فِئَتَيْنِ الْتَقَتَا فِئَةٌ تُقَـتِلُ فِى سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ وَأُخْرَى كَافِرَةٌ يَرَوْنَهُمْ مِّثْلَيْهِمْ رَأْىَ الْعَيْنِ وَاللَّهُ يُؤَيِّدُ بِنَصْرِهِ مَن يَشَآءُ إِنَّ فِى ذَلِكَ لَعِبْرَةً لاوْلِى الاٌّبْصَـرِ ﴿ (There has already been a sign for you (O Jews) in the two armies that met (in combat, the battle of Badr). One was fighting in the cause of Allah, and as for the other, (they) were disbelievers. They (disbelievers) saw them (believers) with their own eyes twice their number. And Allah supports with His aid whom He wills. Verily, in this is a lesson for those who understand.) 3:13   This is how we combine these two Ayat, and certainly, each one of them is true, all the thanks are due to Allah and all the favors are from Him.
