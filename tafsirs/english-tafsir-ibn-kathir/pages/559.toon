  65,7,"<h2>The Divorced Woman has the Right to Decent Accommodations, and what is Reasonable</h2> Allah the Exalted orders His faithful servants that when one of them divorces his wife, he should provide housing for her until the end of her `Iddah period,  أَسْكِنُوهُنَّ مِنْ حَيْثُ سَكَنتُم  (Lodge them where you dwell,) means, with you,  مِّن وُجْدِكُمْ  (according to what you have,) Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid and several others said, it refers to \"Your ability.\" Qatadah said, \"If you can only afford to accommodate her in a corner of your house, then do so.\" <h2>Forbidding Ill-Treatment of Divorced Women</h2> Allah's statement,  وَلاَ تُضَآرُّوهُنَّ لِتُضَيِّقُواْ عَلَيْهِنَّ  (and do not harm them in order to suppress them.) Muqatil bin Hayyan said, \"meaning, do not annoy her to force her to pay her way out nor expel her from your house.\" Ath-Thawri said from Mansur, from Abu Ad-Duha:  وَلاَ تُضَآرُّوهُنَّ لِتُضَيِّقُواْ عَلَيْهِنَّ  (and do not harm them in order to suppress them) \"He divorces her, and when a few days remain, he takes her back.\" <h2>The Irrevocable Divorced Pregnant Woman has the Right of Support (Maintenance) from Her Husband until She gives Birth</h2> Allah said,  وَإِن كُنَّ أُوْلَـتِ حَمْلٍ فَأَنفِقُواْ عَلَيْهِنَّ حَتَّى يَضَعْنَ حَمْلَهُنَّ  (And if they are pregnant, then spend on them till they lay down their burden.) This is about the woman who is irrevocably divorced. If she is pregnant, then she is to be spent on her until she lays down her burden. This is supported due to the fact that if she is revocably divorced, the she has then right to receive her support (maintenance) whether she is pregnant or not. <h2>The Divorced Mother may take Compensation for suckling Her Child</h2> Allah said,  فَإِنْ أَرْضَعْنَ لَكُمْ  (Then if they suckle them for you,) meaning, when pregnant women give birth and they are irrevocably divorced by the expiration of the `Iddah, then at that time they may either suckle the child or not. But that is only after she nourishes him with the milk, that is the early on milk which the infant's well-being depends upon. Then, if she suckles, she has the right to compensation for it. She is allowed to enter into a contract with the father or his representative in return for whatever payment they agree to. This is why Allah the Exalted said,  فَإِنْ أَرْضَعْنَ لَكُمْ فَـَاتُوهُنَّ أُجُورَهُنَّ  (Then if they suckle the children for you, give them their due payment,) Allah said,  وَأْتَمِرُواْ بَيْنَكُمْ بِمَعْرُوفٍ  (and let each of you deal with each other in a mannerly way.) meaning, the affairs of the divorced couple should be managed in a just way without causing harm to either one of them, just as Allah the Exalted said in Surat Al-Baqarah,  لاَ تُضَآرَّ وَلِدَةٌ بِوَلَدِهَا وَلاَ مَوْلُودٌ لَّهُ بِوَلَدِهِ  (No mother shall be treated unfairly on account of her child, nor father on account of child.) (2:233) Allah said,  وَإِن تَعَاسَرْتُمْ فَسَتُرْضِعُ لَهُ أُخْرَى  (But if you make difficulties for one another, then some other woman may suckle for him.) meaning, if the divorced couple disagrees, because the woman asks for an unreasonable fee for suckling their child, and the father refuses to pay the amount or offers an unreasonable amount, he may find another woman to suckle his child. If the mother agrees to accept the amount that was to be paid to the woman who agreed to suckle the child, then she has more right to suckle her own child. Allah's statement,  لِيُنفِقْ ذُو سَعَةٍ مِّن سَعَتِهِ  (Let the rich man spend according to his means;) means, the wealthy father or his representative should spend on the child according to his means,  وَمَن قُدِرَ عَلَيْهِ رِزْقُهُ فَلْيُنفِقْ مِمَّآ ءَاتَاهُ اللَّهُ لاَ يُكَلِّفُ اللَّهُ نَفْساً إِلاَّ مَآ ءَاتَاهَا  (and the man whose resources are restricted, let him spend according to what Allah has given him. Allah puts no burden on any person beyond what He has given him.) This is as Allah said,  لاَ يُكَلِّفُ اللَّهُ نَفْسًا إِلاَّ وُسْعَهَا  (Allah does not burden a person beyond what He can bear.) 2:286 <h2>A Story of a Woman who had Taqwa</h2> Allah's statement;  سَيَجْعَلُ اللَّهُ بَعْدَ عُسْرٍ يُسْراً  (Allah will grant after hardship, ease.) This is a sure promise from Him, and indeed, Allah's promises are true and He never breaks them, This is an Allah's saying;  فَإِنَّ مَعَ الْعُسْرِ يُسْراً - إِنَّ مَعَ الْعُسْرِ يُسْراً  (Verily, along with every hardship is relief. Verily, along with every hardship is relief.) 94:5-6 There is a relevant Hadith that we should mention here. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah said, \"A man and his wife from an earlier generation were poor. Once when the man came back from a journey, he went to his wife saying to her, while feeling hunger and fatigued, `Do you have anything to eat' She said, `Yes, receive the good news of Allah's provisions.' He again said to her, `If you have anything to eat, bring it to me.' She said, `Wait a little longer.' She was awaiting Allah's mercy. When the matter was prolonged, he said to her, `Get up and bring me whatever you have to eat, because I am real hungry and fatigued.' She said, `I will. Soon I will open the oven's cover, so do not be hasty.' When he was busy and refrained from insisting for a while, she said to herself, `I should look in my oven.' So she got up and looked in her oven and found it full of the meat of a lamb, and her mortar and pestle was full of seed grains; it was crushing the seeds on its own. So, she took out what was in the mortar and pestle, after shaking it to remove everything from inside, and also took the meat out that she found in the oven.\" Abu Hurayrah added, \"By He in Whose Hand is the life of Abu Al-Qasim (Prophet Muhammad ﷺ )! This is the same statement that Muhammad ﷺ said,  «لَوْ أَخَذَتْ مَا فِي رَحْيَيْهَا وَلَمْ تَنْفُضْهَا (لَطَحَنَتْهَا) إِلى يَوْمِ الْقِيَامَة»  (Had she taken out what was in her mortar and not emptied it fully by shaking it, it would have continued crushing the seeds until the Day of Resurrection.)\" "

  65,11,"<h2>Punishment for defying Allah's Commandments</h2> Allah the Exalted threatens those who defy His commands, deny His Messengers and contradict His legislation, by informing them of the end that earlier nations met who did the same, ﴾وَكَأِيِّن مِّن قَرْيَةٍ عَتَتْ عَنْ أَمْرِ رَبِّهَا وَرُسُلِهِ﴿ (And many a town revolted against the command of its Lord and His Messengers;) meaning, they rebelled, rejected and arrogantly refused to obey Allah and they would not follow His Messengers, ﴾فَحَاسَبْنَـهَا حِسَاباً شَدِيداً وَعَذَّبْنَـهَا عَذَاباً نُّكْراً﴿ (and We called it to a severe account, and We shall punish it with a horrible torment.) meaning, horrendous and terrifying, ﴾فَذَاقَتْ وَبَالَ أَمْرِهَا﴿ (So it tasted the evil result of its affair,) meaning, they tasted the evil consequences of defiance and they regretted their actions when regret does not avail, ﴾وَكَانَ عَـقِبَةُ أَمْرِهَا خُسْراًأَعَدَّ اللَّهُ لَهُمْ عَذَاباً شَدِيداً﴿ (and the consequence of its affair was loss. And Allah has prepared for them a severe torment.) means, in the Hereafter, added to the torment that was sent down on them in this life. Allah the Exalted said, after mentioning what happened to the disbelieving nations, ﴾فَاتَّقُواْ اللَّهَ يأُوْلِى الأَلْبَـبِ﴿ (So have Taqwa of Allah, O men of understanding,) meaning, `O you who have sound understanding, do not be like them because if you do, you will suffer what they suffered, O people of comprehension,' ﴾الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ﴿ (who believe) meaning, in Allah and His Messengers, ﴾قَدْ أَنزَلَ اللَّهُ إِلَيْكُمْ ذِكْراً﴿ (Allah has indeed sent down to you a Reminder.) meaning, this Qur'an. Allah also said, ﴾إِنَّا نَحْنُ نَزَّلْنَا الذِّكْرَ وَإِنَّا لَهُ لَحَـفِظُونَ ﴿ (Verily, We, it is We Who have sent down the Dhikr and surely, We will preserve it.) (15:9) <h2>The Qualities of the Messenger</h2> Allah's statement, ﴾رَّسُولاً يَتْلُو عَلَيْكُمْ ءَايَـتِ اللَّهِ مُبَيِّنَـتٍ﴿ (A Messenger, who recites to you the Ayat of Allah containing clear explanations,) Some said that the Messenger is the subject of what is being sent as a reminder because the Messenger is the one that conveys the Dhikr. Ibn Jarir said that what is correct is that the Messenger explains the Dhikr. This is why Allah the Exalted said here, ﴾رَّسُولاً يَتْلُو عَلَيْكُمْ ءَايَـتِ اللَّهِ مُبَيِّنَـتٍ﴿ (A Messenger, who recites to you the Ayat of Allah containing clear explanations,) meaning, plain and apparent. The statement of Allah; ﴾لِّيُخْرِجَ الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّـلِحَـتِ مِنَ الظُّلُمَـتِ إِلَى النُّورِ﴿ (that He may take out those who believe and do righteous good deeds, from the darkness to the light.) Allah's is like saying; ﴾كِتَابٌ أَنزَلْنَـهُ إِلَيْكَ لِتُخْرِجَ النَّاسَ مِنَ الظُّلُمَـتِ إِلَى النُّورِ﴿ (A Book which We have revealed unto you in order that you might lead mankind out of darkness) (14:1), and, ﴾اللَّهُ وَلِيُّ الَّذِينَ ءامَنُواْ يُخْرِجُهُم مِّنَ الظُّلُمَـتِ إِلَى النُّورِ﴿ (Allah is the Guardian of those who believe. He brings them out from darkness into light.) (2:257) meaning, out of the darkness of disbelief and ignorance into the light of faith and knowledge. Allah the Exalted called the revelation that He has sent down, light, on account of the guidance that it brings. Allah also called it Ruh, in that, it brings life to the hearts, ﴾وَكَذَلِكَ أَوْحَيْنَآ إِلَيْكَ رُوحاً مِّنْ أَمْرِنَا مَا كُنتَ تَدْرِى مَا الْكِتَـبُ وَلاَ الإِيمَـنُ وَلَـكِن جَعَلْنَـهُ نُوراً نَّهْدِى بِهِ مَن نَّشَآءُ مِنْ عِبَادِنَا وَإِنَّكَ لَتَهْدِى إِلَى صِرَطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ ﴿ (And thus We have sent to you Ruh of our command. You knew not what is the book, nor what is faith But We have made it a light wherewith we guide whosoever of Our servants We will. And verily, you are indeed guiding to the straight path.) (42:52) Allah's statement, ﴾وَمَن يُؤْمِن بِاللَّهِ وَيَعْمَلْ صَـلِحاً يُدْخِلْهُ جَنَّـتٍ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهَا الاٌّنْهَـرُ خَـلِدِينَ فِيهَآ أَبَداً قَدْ أَحْسَنَ اللَّهُ لَهُ رِزْقاً﴿ (And whosoever believes in Allah and performs righteous good deeds, He will admit him into Gardens under which rivers flow, to dwell therein forever. Allah has indeed granted for him an excellent provision.) was explained several times before, and therefore, we do not need to repeat its explanation here. All the thanks and praises are due to Allah. "
  65,12,"<h2>Allah's Perfect Power</h2>  Allah the Exalted asserts His perfect power and infinite greatness, so that the great religion that He has legislated is honored and implemented,  ﴾اللَّهُ الَّذِى خَلَقَ سَبْعَ سَمَـوَتٍ﴿  (It is Allah Who has created seven heavens) Allah said in similar Ayat, like what Prophet Nuh said to his people,  ﴾أَلَمْ تَرَوْاْ كَيْفَ خَلَقَ اللَّهُ سَبْعَ سَمَـوَتٍ طِبَاقاً﴿  (See you not how Allah has created the seven heavens one above another) (71:15), and,  ﴾تُسَبِّحُ لَهُ ٱلسَّمَـٰوَٰتُ ٱلسَّبْعُ وَٱلْأَرْضُ وَمَن فِيهِنَّ﴿  (The seven heavens and the earth and all that is therein, glorify him.) (17:44) Allah's statement,  ﴾وَمِنَ ٱلْأَرْضِ مِثْلَهُنَّ﴿  (and of the earth the like thereof.) means, He created seven earths. In the Two Sahihs, there is a Hadith that states,  ﴾«مَنْ ظَلَمَ قِيدَ شِبْرٍ مِنَ الْأَرْضِ طُوِّقَهُ مِنْ سَبْعِ أَرَضِين»﴿  (Whoever usurps the land of somebody unjustly, even if it was a mere hand span, then his neck will be encircled with it down to the seven earths.) And in Sahih Al-Bukhari the wording is:  ﴾«خُسِفَ بِهِ إِلَى سَبْعِ أَرَضِين»﴿  (...he will sink down to the seven earths.) In the beginning of my book, Al-Bidayah wan-Nihayah, I mentioned the various narrations for this Hadith when I narrated the story of the creation of the earth. All the thanks and praise is due to Allah. Those who explained this Hadith to mean the seven continents have brought an implausible explanation that contradicts the letter of the Qur'an and the Hadith without having proof. This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat At-Talaq, all the thanks and praise is due to Allah. "
