tafsir[6]{c,v,t}:
  12,38,"<h2>Yusuf calls His Jail Mates to Tawhid even before He interprets Their Dreams</h2> Yusuf, peace be upon him, told the two men that he has knowledge in the interpretation of whatever they saw in their dream, and that he will tell them about the interpretation of the dreams before they become a reality. This is why he said,  ﴾لاَ يَأْتِيكُمَا طَعَامٌ تُرْزَقَانِهِ إِلاَّ نَبَّأْتُكُمَا بِتَأْوِيلِهِ﴿ (No food will come to you as your provision, but I will inform you of its interpretation) Mujahid commented,  ﴾لاَ يَأْتِيكُمَا طَعَامٌ تُرْزَقَانِهِ﴿ (No food will come to you as your provision,) this day,  ﴾إِلاَّ نَبَّأْتُكُمَا بِتَأْوِيلِهِ قَبْلَ أَن يَأْتِيَكُمَا﴿ (but I will inform you of its interpretation before it comes.) As-Suddi said similarly. Yusuf said that, this knowledge is from Allah Who taught it to me, because I shunned the religion of those who disbelieve in Him and the Last Day, who neither hope for Allah's reward nor fear His punishment on the Day of Return,  ﴾وَاتَّبَعْتُ مِلَّةَ ءَابَآءِي إِبْرَهِيمَ وَإِسْحَـقَ وَيَعْقُوبَ﴿ (And I have followed the religion of my fathers, - Ibrahim, Ishaq and Ya`qub) Yusuf said, `I have avoided the way of disbelief and polytheism, and followed the way of these honorable Messengers,' may Allah's peace and blessings be on them. This, indeed, is the way of he who seeks the path of guidance and follows the way of the Messengers, all the while shunning the path of deviation. It is he whose heart Allah will guide, teaching him what he did not know beforehand. It is he whom Allah will make an Imam who is imitated in the way of righteousness, and a caller to the path of goodness. Yusuf said next,  ﴾مَا كَانَ لَنَآ أَن نُّشْرِكَ بِاللَّهِ مِن شَىْءٍ ذلِكَ مِن فَضْلِ اللَّهِ عَلَيْنَا وَعَلَى النَّاسِ﴿ (and never could we attribute any partners whatsoever to Allah. This is from the grace of Allah to us and to mankind,) this Tawhid -Monotheism-, affirming that there is no deity worthy of worship except Allah alone without partners,  ﴾مِن فَضْلِ اللَّهِ عَلَيْنَا﴿ (is from the grace of Allah to us), He has revealed it to us and ordained it on us,  ﴾وَعَلَى النَّاسِ﴿ (and to mankind,), to whom He has sent us as callers to Tawhid,  ﴾وَلَـكِنَّ أَكْثَرَ النَّاسِ لاَ يَشْكُرُونَ﴿ (but most men thank not.) they do not admit Allah's favor and blessing of sending the Messengers to them, but rather,  ﴾بَدَّلُواْ نِعْمَتَ اللَّهِ كُفْرًا وَأَحَلُّواْ قَوْمَهُمْ دَارَ الْبَوَارِ﴿ (Have changed the blessings of Allah into disbelief, and caused their people to dwell in the house of destruction.) 14:28  "

  12,40,"﴾ءَأَرْبَابٌ مُّتَّفَرِّقُونَ خَيْرٌ أَمِ اللَّهُ الْوَاحِدُ الْقَهَّارُ﴿ (Are many different lords (gods) better or Allah, the One, the Irresistible) to Whose grace and infinite kingdom everything and everyone has submitted in humiliation. Prophet Yusuf explained to them next that it is because of their ignorance that they worship false deities and give them names, for these names were forged and are being transferred from one generation to the next generation. They have no proof or authority that supports this practice, hence his statement to them,  ﴾مَّآ أَنزَلَ اللَّهُ بِهَا مِن سُلْطَـنٍ﴿ (for which Allah has sent down no authority) or proof and evidence. He then affirmed that the judgement, decision, will and kingdom are all for Allah alone, and He has commanded all of His servants to worship none but Him. He said,  ﴾ذلِكَ الدِّينُ الْقَيِّمُ﴿ (that is the straight religion,) `this, Tawhid of Allah and directing all acts of worship at Him alone in sincerity, that I am calling you to is the right, straight religion that Allah has ordained and for which He has revealed what He wills of proofs and evidences,'  ﴾وَلَـكِنَّ أَكْثَرَ النَّاسِ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ﴿ (but most men know not.), and this is why most of them are idolators,  ﴾وَمَآ أَكْثَرُ النَّاسِ وَلَوْ حَرَصْتَ بِمُؤْمِنِينَ ﴿ (And most of mankind will not believe even if you eagerly desire it.) 12:103 When Yusuf finished calling them, he started interpreting their dreams for them,  "
  12,41,"<h2>The Interpretation of the Dreams</h2> Yusuf said,  ﴾يصَاحِبَىِ السِّجْنِ أَمَّآ أَحَدُكُمَا فَيَسْقِى رَبَّهُ خَمْرًا﴿ (O two companions of the prison! As for one of you, he will pour out wine for his master to drink;) to the man who saw in a dream that he was pressing wine. He did not direct this speech at him, however, so that to lessen the grief of the other person. This is why he made his statement indirect,  ﴾وَأَمَّا الاٌّخَرُ فَيُصْلَبُ فَتَأْكُلُ الطَّيْرُ مِن رَّأْسِهِ﴿ (and as for the other, he will be crucified and birds will eat from his head.) which is the interpretation of the other man's dream in which he saw himself carrying bread above his head. Yusuf told them that the decision about their matter has already been taken and it shall come to pass. This is because the dream is tied to a bird's leg, as long as it is not truthfully interpreted. If it is interpreted, then it becomes a reality. Ath-Thawri said that `Imarah bin Al-Qa`qa` narrated that Ibrahim said that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"When they said what they said to him, and he explained their dreams to them, they replied, `We did not see anything at all.' This is when he said,  ﴾قُضِىَ الاٌّمْرُ الَّذِى فِيهِ تَسْتَفْتِيَانِ﴿ (Thus is the case judged concerning which you both did inquire.)\" The understanding in this is that he who claims that he saw a dream and was given its interpretation, then he will be tied to its interpretation, and Allah has the best knowledge. There is an honorable Hadith that Imam Ahmad collected from Mu`awiyah bin Haydah that the Prophet said,  ﴾«الرُّؤْيَا عَلَى رِجْلِ طَائِرٍ مَا لَمْ تُعْبَرْ، فَإِذَا عُبِرَتْ وَقَعَت»﴿ (The dream is tied to a bird's leg, as long as it is not interpreted. If it is interpreted, it becomes a reality.)  "
  12,42,"<h2>Yusuf asks the King's Distiller to mention Him to the King</h2> Yusuf knew that the distiller would be saved. So discretely, so that the other man's suspicion that he would be crucified would not intensify, he said,  ﴾اذْكُرْنِى عِندَ رَبِّكَ﴿ (Mention me to your King.) asking him to mention his story to the king. That man forgot Yusuf's request and did not mention his story to the king, a plot from the devil, so that Allah's Prophet would not leave the prison. This is the correct meaning of,  ﴾فَأَنْسَاهُ الشَّيْطَـنُ ذِكْرَ رَبِّهِ﴿ (But Shaytan made him forget to mention it to his master.) that it refers to the man who was saved. As was said by Mujahid, Muhammad bin Ishaq and several others. As for, `a few years', or, Bida` in Arabic, it means between three and nine, according to Mujahid and Qatadah. Wahb bin Munabbih said, \"Ayyub suffered from the illness for seven years, Yusuf remained in prison for seven years and Bukhtanassar (Nebuchadnezzar - Chaldean king of Babylon) was tormented for seven years.\"  "
