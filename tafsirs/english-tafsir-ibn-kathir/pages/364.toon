tafsir[12]{c,v,t}:
  25,44,"<h2>How the Disbelievers mocked the Messenger</h2> Allah tells us how the disbelievers mocked the Messenger when they saw him. This is like the Ayah, ﴾وَإِذَا رَآكَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ إِن يَتَّخِذُونَكَ إِلاَّ هُزُواً﴿ (And when the disbelievers see you, they take you not except for mockery) (21:36), which means that they tried to find faults and shortcomings in him. Here Allah says: ﴾وَإِذَا رَأَوْكَ إِن يَتَّخِذُونَكَ إِلاَّ هُزُواً أَهَـذَا الَّذِى بَعَثَ اللَّهُ رَسُولاً ﴿ (And when they see you, they treat you only in mockery (saying): \"Is this the one whom Allah has sent as a Messenger\") i.e., they said this by way of belittling and trying to undermine him, so Allah put them in their place, and said: ﴾وَلَقَدِ اسْتُهْزِىءَ بِرُسُلٍ مِّن قَبْلِكَ﴿ (And indeed Messengers before you were mocked at) (6:10) ﴾إِن كَادَ لَيُضِلُّنَا عَنْ ءَالِهَتِنَا﴿ (He would have nearly misled us from our gods,) They meant: `he nearly turned us away from worshipping idols, and he would have done so, had we not been patient and persevered in our ways.' So Allah said, warning and threatening them: ﴾وَسَوْفَ يَعْلَمُونَ حِينَ يَرَوْنَ الْعَذَابَ﴿ (And they will know, when they see the torment...) <h2>They took Their Desires as their gods and were more astray than Cattle</h2> Then Allah tells His Prophet that if Allah decrees that someone will be misguided and wretched, then no one can guide him except Allah, glory be to Him: ﴾أَرَءَيْتَ مَنِ اتَّخَذَ إِلَـهَهُ هَوَاهُ﴿ (Have you seen him who has taken as his god his own vain desire) meaning, whatever he admires and sees as good in his own desires becomes his religion and his way. As Allah says: ﴾أَفَمَن زُيِّنَ لَهُ سُوءَ عَمَلِهِ فَرَءَاهُ حَسَناً فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ يُضِلُّ مَن يَشَآءُ﴿ (Is he then, to whom the evil of his deeds is made fair seeming. So that he consider it as good. Verily, Allah sends astray whom he wills.) 35:8 ﴾أَفَأَنتَ تَكُونُ عَلَيْهِ وَكِيلاً﴿ (Would you then be a guardian over him) Ibn `Abbas said: \"During the Jahiliyyah, a man would worship a white rock for a while, then if he saw another that looked better, he would worship that and leave the first.\" Then Allah said: ﴾أَمْ تَحْسَبُ أَنَّ أَكْثَرَهُمْ يَسْمَعُونَ أَوْ يَعْقِلُونَ﴿ (Or do you think that most of them hear or understand) meaning, they are worse than grazing cattle. Cattle only do what they were created to do, but these people were created to worship Allah Alone without associating partners with Him, but they worship others with Him, even though evidence has been established against them and Messengers have been sent to them.

  25,47,"<h2>Evidence of the existence of the Creator and the extent of His Power</h2> Here Allah begins explaining the evidence for His existence and His perfect power to create various things and pairs of opposites. Allah says: ﴾أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى رَبِّكَ كَيْفَ مَدَّ الظِّلَّ﴿ (Have you not seen how your Lord spread the shadow.) Ibn `Abbas, Ibn `Umar, Abu Al-`Aliyah, Abu Malik, Masruq, Mujahid, Sa`id bin Jubayr, An-Nakha`i, Ad-Dahhak, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, As-Suddi and others said, \"This refers to the period from the beginning of the dawn until the sun rises.\" ﴾وَلَوْ شَآءَ لَجَعَلَهُ سَاكِناً﴿ (If He willed, He could have made it still) meaning, immobile, never changing. This is like the Ayat: ﴾قُلْ أَرَأَيْتُمْ إِن جَعَلَ اللَّهُ عَلَيْكُمُ الَّيْلَ سَرْمَداً﴿ (Say : \"Tell me! If Allah made the night continuous for you...\") (28:71) ﴾ثُمَّ جَعَلْنَا الشَّمْسَ عَلَيْهِ دَلِيلاً﴿ (but We have made the sun its guide.) means, were it not for the sun rising, it would not be there, for a thing can only be known in contrast to its opposite. Qatadah and As-Suddi said, \"The sun is a guide which follows the shade until the shade disappears. \" ﴾ثُمَّ قَبَضْنَـهُ إِلَيْنَا قَبْضاً يَسِيراً ﴿ (Then We withdraw it towards Ourselves -- a gradual withdrawal.) This refers to the shade. ﴾يَسِيراً﴿ (gradual) meaning slowly. As-Suddi said: \"A gentle, concealed, withdrawal until there is no shade left on earth except under a roof or a tree, and the sun is shining on whatever is above it.\" ﴾قَبْضاً يَسِيراً﴿ (a gradual withdrawal.) Ayyub bin Musa said: \"Little by little. ﴾وَهُوَ الَّذِى جَعَلَ لَكُمُ الَّيْلَ لِبَاساً﴿ (And it is He Who makes the night a covering for you,) It covers and conceals all things. This is like the Ayah: ﴾وَالَّيْلِ إِذَا يَغْشَى ﴿ (By the night as it envelops) (92:1). ﴾وَالنَّوْمَ سُبَاتاً﴿ (and the sleep a repose,) means, a halt to movement so that bodies may rest. For the faculties and limbs get tired from their constant movement during the day when one goes out to earn a living. When night comes, and it becomes quiet, they stop moving, and rest; so sleep provides a rejuvenation for both the body and the soul. ﴾وَجَعَلَ النَّهَارَ نُشُوراً﴿ (and makes the day Nushur) meaning, people get up and go out to earn a living and attend to their business. This is like the Ayah: ﴾وَمِن رَّحْمَتِهِ جَعَلَ لَكُمُ الَّيْلَ وَالنَّهَارَ لِتَسْكُنُواْ فِيهِ وَلِتَبتَغُواْ مِن فَضْلِهِ﴿ (It is out of His mercy that He has made for you the night and the day that you may rest therein and that you may seek of His bounty...) (28:73) ﴾وَهُوَ الَّذِى أَرْسَلَ الرِّيَـحَ بُشْرَى بَيْنَ يَدَىْ رَحْمَتِهِ وَأَنزَلْنَا مِنَ السَّمَآءِ مَآءً طَهُوراً ﴿"

  25,50,"<h2>This is also part of His complete power and supreme authority:</h2> Allah sends the winds as heralds of glad tidings, i.e., they bring the clouds behind them. The winds are of many different types, depending on the purpose for which they are sent. Some of them form the clouds, others carry the clouds or drive them, and others come ahead of the clouds as heralds announcing their coming. Some of them come before that to stir up the earth, and some of them fertilize or \"seed\" the clouds to make it rain. Allah says:  وَأَنزَلْنَا مِنَ السَّمَآءِ مَآءً طَهُوراً  (and We send down pure water from the sky), meaning, as a means of purifying it. Abu Sa`id said, \"It was said: \"O Messenger of Allah, can we perform Wudu' with the water of the well of Buda`ah For it is a well in which rubbish and the flesh of dogs are thrown. He said:  «إِنَّ الْمَاءَ طَهُورٌ لَا يُنَجِّسُهُ شَيْء»  (Water is pure and nothing makes it impure.) This was recorded by Ash-Shafi`i and Ahmad, who graded it Sahih, and also by Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi, who graded it Hasan, and by An-Nasa'i. His saying:  لِّنُحْيِىَ بِهِ بَلْدَةً مَّيْتاً  (That We may give life thereby to a dead land,) means, a land that waited a long time for rain. It is devoid of vegetation or anything at all. When the rain comes to it, it becomes alive and its hills are covered with all kinds of colorful flowers, as Allah says:  فَإِذَآ أَنزَلْنَا عَلَيْهَا الْمَآءَ اهْتَزَّتْ وَرَبَتْ  (but when We send down water to it, it is stirred to life and growth...) (41:39). His saying:  وَنُسْقِيَهِ مِمَّا خَلَقْنَآ أَنْعَـماً وَأَنَاسِىَّ كَثِيراً  (and We give to drink thereof many of the cattle and men that We had created. ) means, so that animals such as cattle can drink from it, and people who are in desperate need of water can drink from it and water their crops and fruits. This is like the Ayah:  وَهُوَ الَّذِى يُنَزِّلُ الْغَيْثَ مِن بَعْدِ مَا قَنَطُواْ  (And He it is Who sends down the rain after they have despaired,) (42:28)  فَانظُرْ إِلَى ءَاثَـرِ رَحْمَةِ اللَّهِ كَيْفَ يُحْىِ الاٌّرْضَ بَعْدَ مَوْتِهَآ  (Look then at the effects of Allah's mercy, how He revives the earth after its death.) (30:50) His saying:  وَلَقَدْ صَرَّفْنَـهُ بَيْنَهُمْ لِيَذَّكَّرُواْ  (And indeed We have distributed it among them in order that they may remember) means, `We cause rain to fall on this land and not on that, and We cause the clouds to pass over one land and go to another, where We cause sufficient rain to fall so that its people have plenty, but not one drop falls on the first land.' There is a reason and great wisdom behind this. Ibn `Abbas and Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with them said: \"One year does not have more rain than another, but Allah distributes the rain as He wills. Then he recited this Ayah:  وَلَقَدْ صَرَّفْنَـهُ بَيْنَهُمْ لِيَذَّكَّرُواْ فَأَبَى أَكْثَرُ النَّاسِ إِلاَّ كُفُوراً  (And indeed We have distributed it (rain or water) amongst them in order that they may remember the grace of Allah, but most men refuse (out of) ingratitude. )\" meaning, so that they may be reminded, when Allah brings the dead earth back to life, that He is able to bring the dead and dry bones back to life, or that those from whom rain is withheld are suffering this because of some sin they have committed, so that they may give it up.  فَأَبَى أَكْثَرُ النَّاسِ إِلاَّ كُفُورًا  (but most men refuse (out of) ingratitude.) `Ikrimah said, \"This refers to those who say that rain comes because of such and such a star.\" This view of `Ikrimah is similar to the authentic Hadith recorded in Sahih Muslim; one day after a night's rain, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to his Companions:  «أَتَدْرُونَ مَاذَا قَالَ رَبُّكُمْ؟»  (Do you know what your Lord says) They said: \"Allah and His Messenger know best.\" He said:  «قَالَ: أَصْبَحَ مِنْ عِبَادِي مُؤْمِنٌ بِي وَكَافِرٌ، فَأَمَّا مَنْ قَالَ: مُطِرْنَا بِفَضْلِ اللهِ وَرَحْمَتِهِ فَذَاكَ مُؤْمِنٌ بِي، كَافِرٌ بِالْكَوْكَبِ، وَأَمَّا مَنْ قَالَ: مُطِرْنَا بِنَوْءِ كَذَا وَكَذَا، فَذَاكَ كَافِرٌ بِي، مُؤْمِنٌ بِالْكَوْكَب»  (He says: \"This morning some of My servants became believers in Me, and some became disbelievers. As for the one who said, `We have been given rain by the mercy and grace of Allah,' he is a believer in Me and a disbeliever in the stars. As for the one who said, `We have been given rain by such and such a star,' he is a disbeliever in Me and a believer in the stars.\") "

  25,54,"<h2>The universality of the Prophet's Message, how He was supported in His Mission and Allah's Blessings to Mankind</h2> Allah says:  وَلَوْ شِئْنَا لَبَعَثْنَا فِى كُلِّ قَرْيَةٍ نَّذِيراً  (And had We willed, We would have raised a warner in every town.) `Calling them to Allah, but We have singled you out, O Muhammad, to be sent to all the people of earth, and We have commanded you to convey the Qur'an,'  لاٌّنذِرَكُمْ بِهِ وَمَن بَلَغَ  (that I may therewith warn you and whomsoever it may reach) (6:19).  وَمَن يَكْفُرْ بِهِ مِنَ الاٌّحْزَابِ فَالنَّارُ مَوْعِدُهُ  (but those of the sects that reject it, the Fire will be their promised meeting place) (11:17).  لِّتُنذِرَ أُمَّ الْقُرَى وَمَنْ حَوْلَهَا  (that you may warn the Mother of the Towns and all around it) (42:7).  قُلْ يَأَيُّهَا النَّاسُ إِنِّى رَسُولُ اللَّهِ إِلَيْكُمْ جَمِيعًا  (Say: \"O mankind! Verily, I am sent to you all as the Messenger of Allah...\") (7:158). In the Two Sahihs (it is reported that the Prophet said:)  «بُعِثْتُ إِلَى الْأَحْمَرِ وَالْأَسْوَد»  (I have been sent to the red and the black. ) And:  «وَكَانَ النَّبِيُّ يُبْعَثُ إِلَى قَوْمِهِ خَاصَّةً، وَبُعِثْتُ إِلَى النَّاسِ عَامَّة»  (...A Prophet would be sent to his own people, but I have been sent to all of mankind.) Allah says:  فَلاَ تُطِعِ الْكَـفِرِينَ وَجَـهِدْهُمْ بِهِ  (So obey not the disbelievers, but strive hard against them with it.) meaning, with the Qur'an. This was the view of Ibn `Abbas.  جِهَاداً كَبيراً  (with the utmost endeavour.) This is like the Ayah,  يَأَيُّهَا النَّبِىُّ جَـهِدِ الْكُفَّـرَ وَالْمُنَـفِقِينَ  (O Prophet! Strive hard against the disbelievers and the hypocrites,) (9:73)  وَهُوَ الَّذِى مَرَجَ الْبَحْرَيْنِ هَـذَا عَذْبٌ فُرَاتٌ وَهَـذَا مِلْحٌ أُجَاجٌ  (And it is He Who has let free the two seas, this is palatable and sweet, and that is salty and bitter;) means, He has created the two kinds of water, sweet and salty. The sweet water is like that in rivers, springs and wells, which is fresh, sweet, palatable water. This was the view of Ibn Jurayj and of Ibn Jarir, and this is the meaning without a doubt, for nowhere in creation is there a sea which is fresh and sweet. Allah has told us about reality so that His servants may realize His blessings to them and give thanks to Him. The sweet water is that which flows amidst people. Allah has portioned it out among His creatures according to their needs; rivers and springs in every land, according to what they need for themselves and their lands.  وَهَـذَا مِلْحٌ أُجَاجٌ  (and that is salty and bitter;) meaning that it is salty, bitter and not easy to swallow. This is like the seas that are known in the east and the west, the Atlantic Ocean and the Straits that lead to it, the Red Sea, the Arabian Sea, the Persian Gulf, the China Sea, the Indian Ocean, the Mediterranean Sea, the Black Sea and so on, all the seas that are stable and do not flow, but they swell and surge in the winter and when the winds are strong, and they have tides that ebb and flow. At the beginning of each month the tides ebb and flood, and when the month starts to wane they retreat until they go back to where they started. When the crescent of the following month appears, the tide begins to ebb again until the fourteenth of the month, then it decreases. Allah, may He be glorified, the One Whose power is absolute, has set these laws in motion, so all of these seas are stationary, and He has made their water salty lest the air turn putrid because of them and the whole earth turn rotten as a result, and lest the earth spoil because of the animals dying on it. Because its water is salty, its air is healthy and its dead are good (to eat), hence when the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was asked whether sea water can be used for Wudu', he said:  «هُوَ الطَّهُورُ مَاؤُهُ، الْحِلُّ مَيْتَتُه»  (Its water is pure and its dead are lawful.) This was recorded by Malik, Ash-Shafi`i and Ahmad, and by the scholars of Sunan with a good Jayyid chain of narration.  وَجَعَلَ بَيْنَهُمَا بَرْزَخاً وَحِجْراً  (and He has set a barrier and a complete partition between them. ) meaning, between the sweet water and the saltwater.  بَرْزَخاً  (a barrier) means a partition, which is dry land.  وَحِجْراً مَّحْجُوراً  (and a complete partition) means, a barrier, to prevent one of them from reaching the other. This is like the Ayat:  مَرَجَ الْبَحْرَيْنِ يَلْتَقِيَانِ - بَيْنَهُمَا بَرْزَخٌ لاَّ يَبْغِيَانِ فَبِأَىِّ ءَالاءِ رَبِّكُمَا تُكَذِّبَانِ  (He has let loose the two seas meeting together. Between them is a barrier which none of them can transgress. Then which of the blessings of your Lord will you both deny) (55:19-21)  أَمَّن جَعَلَ الاٌّرْضَ قَرَاراً وَجَعَلَ خِلاَلَهَآ أَنْهَاراً وَجَعَلَ لَهَا رَوَاسِىَ وَجَعَلَ بَيْنَ الْبَحْرَيْنِ حَاجِزاً أَءِلـهٌ مَّعَ اللهِ بَلْ أَكْثَرُهُمْ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ  (Is not He Who has made the earth as a fixed abode, and has placed rivers in its midst, and placed firm mountains therein, and set a barrier between the two seas Is there any god with Allah Nay, but most of them know not!) (27:61)  وَهُوَ الَّذِى خَلَقَ مِنَ الْمَآءِ بَشَراً  (And it is He Who has created man from water,) means, He created man from a weak Nutfah, then gave him shape and formed him, and completed his form, male and female, as He willed.  فَجَعَلَهُ نَسَباً وَصِهْراً  (and has appointed for him kindred by blood, and kindred by marriage.) in the beginning, he is someone's child, then he gets married and becomes a son-in-law, then he himself has sons-in-law and other relatives through marriage. All of this comes from a despised liquid, Allah says:  وَكَانَ رَبُّكَ قَدِيراً  (And your Lord is Ever All-Powerful to do what He wills.) "
