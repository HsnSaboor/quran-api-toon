tafsir[7]{c,v,t}:
  35,12,"<h2>The Blessings and Signs of Allah</h2> Allah says, pointing out His mighty power in creating different things, how He has created the two seas (kinds of water). The fresh, palatable sea (kind of water) refers to the rivers which flow among people, rivers great and small according to people's needs in all regions and areas and lands. This water is sweet and palatable for whoever wants to drink it. ﴾وَهَـذَا مِلْحٌ أُجَاجٌ﴿ and that is salty and bitter. means, unpalatable. This is the ocean in which the big ships sail, and is salty and undrinkable. Allah says: ﴾وَهَـذَا مِلْحٌ أُجَاجٌ﴿ (and that is salty and bittery.) Then Allah says: ﴾وَمِن كُلٍّ تَأْكُلُونَ لَحْماً طَرِيّاً﴿ (And from them both you eat fresh tender meat,) meaning, fish. ﴾وَتَسْتَخْرِجُونَ حِلْيَةً تَلْبَسُونَهَا﴿ (and derive the ornaments that you wear.) This is like the Ayah: ﴾يَخْرُجُ مِنْهُمَا الُّلؤْلُؤُ وَالمَرْجَانُ فَبِأَىِّ ءَالاءِ رَبِّكُمَا تُكَذِّبَانِ ﴿ (Out of them both come out pearl and coral. Then which of the blessings of your Lord will you both (Jinn and men) deny) (55:22-23). ﴾وَتَرَى الْفُلْكَ فِيهِ مَوَاخِرَ﴿ And you see the ships cleaving, means, they travel through it, plowing through the water with their beak-shaped bows. Muja0hid said, The wind drives the ships, and the wind cannot drive any ships except the big ones. ﴾وَلِتَبْتَغُواْ مِن فَضْلِهِ﴿ that you may seek of His bounty, means, through your journeys to engage in trade from one land to another. ﴾وَلَعَلَّكُمْ تَشْكُرُونَ﴿ and that you may give thanks. means, that you may give thanks to your Lord for subjugating this mighty creation -- the sea -- to you, so that you can travel through it as you wish and go wherever you want, and nothing stops you؛ His power has subjugated for you whatever is in the heavens and on earth, and all of this is by His grace and mercy. "

  35,14,"<h2>The gods of the Idolators do not even own a Qitmir</h2> Another aspect of His perfect power and might is that He has subjugated the night with its darkness and the day with its light. He takes from the length of the one and adds it to the shortness of the other, until they become equal. Then He takes from the latter and adds to the former, so one becomes long and the other becomes short, so they take from one another in summer and in winter. ﴾وَسَخَّرَ الشَّمْسَ وَالْقَمَرَ﴿ (And He has subjected the sun and the moon,) and the stars and planets, with their light. All of them run in their appointed courses and in the manner prescribed for them, as decreed by the Almighty, All-Knowing. ﴾كُـلٌّ يَجْرِى لاًّجَـلٍ مُّسَـمًّى﴿ each runs its course for a term appointed. means, until the Day of Resurrection. ﴾ذَلِكُـمُ اللَّهُ رَبُّـكُمْ﴿ Such is Allah, your Lord؟ means, the One Who has done all this is the Almighty Lord besides Whom there is no other true God. ﴾وَالَّذِينَ تَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِهِ﴿ (And those, whom you invoke or call upon instead of Him,) means, `the idols and false gods whom you claim to be in the form of angels who are close to Allah,' ﴾مَا يَمْلِكُونَ مِن قِطْمِيرٍ﴿ own not even a Qitلm0r. Ibn Abba0s, may Allah be pleased with him, Muja0hid, Ikrimah, Ata0 , Atلiyah Al- Awfi, Al-Hلasan, Qata0dah and others said, This is the thread that is attached to the pit of a date. In other words, they do not possess anything in the heavens or on earth, not even anything equivalent to this Qitلm0r. Then Allah says: ﴾إِن تَدْعُوهُمْ لاَ يَسْمَعُواْ دُعَآءَكُمْ﴿ (If you invoke them, they hear not your call;) means, `the gods upon whom you call instead of Allah, do not hear your supplication, because they are inanimate and have no soul in them.' ﴾وَلَوْ سَمِعُواْ مَا اسْتَجَابُواْ لَكُمْ﴿ (and if (in case) they were to hear, they could not grant it to you.) means, `they are not able to do any of the things that you ask them for.' ﴾وَيَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ يَكْفُرُونَ بِشِرْكِـكُمْ﴿ And on the Day of Resurrection, they will disown your worshipping them means, `they will disown you.' This is like the Ayat: ﴾وَمَنْ أَضَلُّ مِمَّن يَدْعُو مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ مَن لاَّ يَسْتَجِيبُ لَهُ إِلَى يَوْمِ الْقِيَـمَةِ وَهُمْ عَن دُعَآئِهِمْ غَـفِلُونَ - وَإِذَا حُشِرَ النَّاسُ كَانُواْ لَهُمْ أَعْدَآءً وَكَانُواْ بِعِبَادَتِهِمْ كَـفِرِينَ ﴿ (And who is more astray than one who calls on besides Allah, such as will not answer him till the Day of Resurrection, and who are (even) unaware of their calls to them And when mankind are gathered, they (false deities) will become their enemies and will deny their worshipping.) (46:5-6), and ﴾وَاتَّخَذُواْ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ ءالِهَةً لِّيَكُونُواْ لَهُمْ عِزّاً ﴿﴾كَلاَّ سَيَكْفُرُونَ بِعِبَـدَتِهِمْ وَيَكُونُونَ عَلَيْهِمْ ضِدّاً ﴿ (And they have taken gods besides Allah, that they might give them honor, power and glory. Nay, but they will deny their worship of them, and become opponents to them.) (19:81-82) ﴾وَلاَ يُنَبِّئُكَ مِثْلُ خَبِيرٍ﴿ (And none can inform you like Him Who is the All-Knower.) means, no one can tell you about the consequences of things and how they will end like the One Who is the All-Knower of them. Qatadah said, \"He is referring to Himself, may He be blessed and exalted, for He undoubtedly tells the truth.\" "

  35,18,"<h2>Mankind is in need of Allah, and each Person will carry His own Burdens on the Day of Resurrection</h2> Allah tells us that He has no need of anyone or anything else, but all of creation is in need of Him and is in a position of humility before Him. He says: ﴾يأَيُّهَا النَّاسُ أَنتُمُ الْفُقَرَآءُ إِلَى اللَّهِ﴿ (O mankind! it is you who stand in need of Allah.) meaning, they need Him in all that they do, but He has no need of them at all. Allah says: ﴾وَاللَّهُ هُوَ الْغَنِىُّ الْحَمِيدُ﴿ But Allah is the Rich, Worthy of all praise. meaning, He is unique in His being Free of all needs, and has no partner or associate, and He is Worthy of all praise in all that He does, says, decrees and legislates. ﴾إِن يَشَأْ يُذْهِبْكُـمْ وَيَأْتِ بِخَلْقٍ جَدِيدٍ ﴿ (If He willed, He could destroy you and bring about a new creation.) means, if He wanted to, He could destroy you and bring forth another people, and this is not difficult or impossible for Him. He says: ﴾وَمَا ذَلِكَ عَلَى اللَّهِ بِعَزِيزٍ ﴿ (And that is not hard for Allah.) Allah's saying: ﴾وَلاَ تَزِرُ وَازِرَةٌ وِزْرَ أُخْرَى﴿ (And no bearer of burdens shall bear another's burden;) means, on the Day of Resurrection. ﴾وَإِن تَدْعُ مُثْقَلَةٌ إِلَى حِمْلِهَا﴿ (and if one heavily laden calls another to (bear) his load, ) means, if the person who is carrying a heavy burden calls someone else to help him carry his load, all or part of it, ﴾لاَ يُحْمَلْ مِنْهُ شَىْءٌ وَلَوْ كَانَ ذَا قُرْبَى﴿ (nothing of it will be lifted even though he be near of kin.) means, even if he is closely-related to him, even if he is his father or son, for each person will be preoccupied with his own self and his own situation. Then Allah says: ﴾إِنَّمَا تُنذِرُ الَّذِينَ يَخْشَوْنَ رَبَّهُمْ بِالْغَيْبِ وَأَقَامُواْ الصَّلَوةَ﴿ (You can warn only those who fear their Lord unseen and perform the Salah.) means, `the only ones who will draw a lesson from what you have brought are those who are possessed of insight and wisdom, who fear their Lord and who do as He commands.' ﴾وَمَن تَزَكَّى فَإِنَّمَا يَتَزَكَّى لِنَفْسِهِ﴿ (And he who purifies himself, then he purifies only for the benefit of himself.) means, who does righteous deeds, the benefit of that will come back to him, ﴾وَإِلَى اللَّهِ الْمَصِيرُ﴿ And to Allah is the Return. means, to Him everything will ultimately return, and He is swift in bringing to account. He will reward or punish everyone according to his deeds: if they are good, then the end will be good, and if they are bad, then the end will be bad. "
