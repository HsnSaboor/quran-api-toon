tafsir[8]{c,v,t}:
  6,45,"<h2>The Idolators Call On Allah Alone During Torment and Distress</h2> Allah states that He does what He wills with His creatures and none can resist His decision or avert what He decrees for them. He is the One Who has no partners, Who accepts the supplication from whomever He wills. Allah said,  ﴾قُلْ أَرَأَيْتُكُم إِنْ أَتَـكُمْ عَذَابُ اللَّهِ أَوْ أَتَتْكُمْ السَّاعَةُ أَغَيْرَ اللَّهِ تَدْعُونَ إِن كُنتُمْ صَـدِقِينَ ﴿ (Say: \"Tell me if Allah's torment comes upon you, or the Hour comes upon you, would you then call upon any one other than Allah (Reply) if you are truthful!\") This means, you -- disbelievers -- will not call other than Allah in this case, because you know that none except He is able to remove the affliction. Allah said,  ﴾إِن كُنتُمْ صَـدِقِينَ﴿ (if you are truthful) by taking gods besides Him.  ﴾بَلْ إِيَّـهُ تَدْعُونَ فَيَكْشِفُ مَا تَدْعُونَ إِلَيْهِ إِنْ شَآءَ وَتَنسَوْنَ مَا تُشْرِكُونَ ﴿ (Nay! To Him alone you call, and, if He willed, He would remove that (distress) for which you call upon Him, and you forget at that time whatever partners you joined with Him (in worship)!) for in times of necessity, you only call on Allah and forget your idols and false deities. In another Ayah, Allah said;  ﴾وَإِذَا مَسَّكُمُ الْضُّرُّ فِى الْبَحْرِ ضَلَّ مَن تَدْعُونَ إِلاَ إِيَّاهُ﴿ (And when harm touches you upon the sea, those that you call upon besides Him vanish from you except Him (Allah)) 17:67. Allah said;  ﴾وَلَقَدْ أَرْسَلنَآ إِلَى أُمَمٍ مِّن قَبْلِكَ فَأَخَذْنَـهُمْ بِالْبَأْسَآءِ﴿ (Verily, We sent (Messengers) to many nations before you. And We seized them with extreme poverty...) That is, loss of wealth and diminished provisions,  ﴾وَالضَّرَّآءِ﴿ (and loss of health) various illnesses, diseases and pain,  ﴾لَعَلَّهُمْ يَتَضَرَّعُونَ﴿ (so that they might believe with humility) and call Allah and supplicate to Him with humbleness and humility. Allah said;  ﴾فَلَوْلا إِذْ جَآءَهُمْ بَأْسُنَا تَضَرَّعُواْ﴿ (When Our torment reached them, why then did they not believe with humility) Meaning: Why do they not believe and humble themselves before Us when We test them with disaster'  ﴾وَلَـكِن قَسَتْ قُلُوبُهُمْ﴿ (But their hearts became hardened,) for their hearts are not soft or humble,  ﴾وَزَيَّنَ لَهُمُ الشَّيْطَـنُ مَا كَانُواّ يَعْمَلُونَ﴿ (and Shaytan made fair-seeming to them that which they used to do. ) That is, Shirk, defiance and rebellion.  ﴾فَلَمَّا نَسُواْ مَا ذُكِّرُواْ بِهِ﴿ (So, when they forgot (the warning) with which they had been reminded,) by ignoring and turning away from it,  ﴾فَتَحْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ أَبْوَابَ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ﴿ (We opened to them the gates of everything,) Meaning: `We opened the gates of provisions for them from wherever they wished, so that We deceive them.' We seek refuge with Allah from such an end. This is why Allah said,  ﴾حَتَّى إِذَا فَرِحُواْ بِمَآ أُوتُواْ﴿ f(until in the midst of their enjoyment in that which they were given,) such as wealth, children and provisions,  ﴾أَخَذْنَـهُمْ بَغْتَةً فَإِذَا هُمْ مُّبْلِسُونَ﴿ (all of a sudden, We took them to punishment and lo! They were plunged into destruction with deep regrets and sorrows.) They have no hope for any type of good thing. Al-Hasan Al-Basri said, \"Whomever Allah gives provision and he thinks that Allah is not testing him, has no wisdom. Whomever has little provision and thinks that Allah will not look at (provide for) him, has no wisdom.\" He then recited the Ayah,  ﴾فَلَمَّا نَسُواْ مَا ذُكِّرُواْ بِهِ فَتَحْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ أَبْوَابَ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ حَتَّى إِذَا فَرِحُواْ بِمَآ أُوتُواْ أَخَذْنَـهُمْ بَغْتَةً فَإِذَا هُمْ مُّبْلِسُونَ ﴿ (So, when they forgot (the warning) with which they had been reminded, We opened to them the gates of every (pleasant) thing, until in the midst of their enjoyment in that which they were given, all of a sudden, We took them to punishment, and lo! They were plunged into destruction with deep regrets and sorrows.) He added, \"By the Lord of the Ka`bah! Allah deceived these people, when He gave them what they wished, and then they were punished.\" Ibn Abi Hatim recorded this statement.  "

  6,49," أَرَأَيْتُمْ إِنْ أَخَذَ اللَّهُ سَمْعَكُمْ وَأَبْصَـرَكُمْ  (Tell me, if Allah took away your hearing and your sight.) just as He gave these senses to you. In another Ayah, Allah said;  هُوَ الَّذِى أَنشَأَكُمْ وَجَعَلَ لَكُمُ السَّمْعَ وَالاٌّبْصَـرَ  (It is He Who has created you, and endowed you with hearing, seeing.) 67:23. The Ayah above might also mean that Allah will not allow the disbelievers to benefit from these senses in religious terms. This is why He said next,  وَخَتَمَ عَلَى قُلُوبِكُمْ  (and sealed up your hearts,.) He also said in other Ayat,  أَمَّن يَمْلِكُ السَّمْعَ والاٌّبْصَـرَ  (Or who owns hearing and sight) 10:31, and,  وَاعْلَمُواْ أَنَّ اللَّهَ يَحُولُ بَيْنَ الْمَرْءِ وَقَلْبِهِ  (And know that Allah comes in between a person and his heart.) Allah said;  مَّنْ إِلَـهٌ غَيْرُ اللَّهِ يَأْتِيكُمْ بِهِ  (Is there a god other than Allah who could restore them to you) Meaning, is there anyone except Allah who is able to give you back these senses if Allah took them from you Only Allah is able to do so, and this is why He said here,  انْظُرْ كَيْفَ نُصَرِّفُ الاٌّيَـتِ  (See how variously We explain the Ayat,) and make them plain and clear, testifying to Allah's Oneness in lordship and that those worshipped besides Him are all false and unworthy.  ثُمَّ هُمْ يَصْدِفُونَ  (yet they turn aside.) After this explanation, they still turn away from the truth and hinder people from following it. Allah's statement,  قُلْ أَرَأَيْتَكُمْ إِنْ أَتَـكُمْ عَذَابُ اللَّهِ بَغْتَةً  (Say: \"Tell me, if the punishment of Allah comes to you suddenly...\") means, while you are unaware -- or during the night -- striking you all of a sudden,  أَوْ جَهْرَةً  (or openly) during the day, or publicly,  هَلْ يُهْلَكُ إِلاَّ الْقَوْمُ الظَّـلِمُونَ  (will any be destroyed except the wrongdoing people) This torment only strikes those who commit injustice against themselves by associating others with Allah, while those who worship Allah alone without partners will be saved from it, and they will have no fear or sorrow. In another Ayah, Allah said;  الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَلَمْ يَلْبِسُواْ إِيمَـنَهُمْ بِظُلْمٍ  (It is those who believe and confuse not their belief with Zulm, (wrong or Shirk).) 6:82 Allah's statement,  وَمَا نُرْسِلُ الْمُرْسَلِينَ إِلاَّ مُبَشِّرِينَ وَمُنذِرِينَ  (And We send not the Messengers but as bearers of glad tidings and as warners.) means, the Messengers ﷺ bring good news to Allah's servants, as well as, command all that is good and righteous. They also warn those who disbelieve in Allah of His anger and of all types of torment. Allah said,  فَمَنْ ءَامَنَ وَأَصْلَحَ  (So whosoever believes and does righteous good deeds.) meaning, whoever believes in his heart with what the Messengers were sent with and makes his works righteous by imitating them;  فَلاَ خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ  (upon such shall come no fear,) concerning the future,  وَلاَ هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ  (nor shall they grieve.) about what they missed in the past and left behind them in this world. Certainly, Allah will be the Wali and Protector over what they left behind. Allah said next,  وَالَّذِينَ كَذَّبُواْ بِـَايَـتِنَا يَمَسُّهُمُ الْعَذَابُ بِمَا كَانُواْ يَفْسُقُونَ  (But those who reject Our Ayat, the torment will strike them for their rebelling.) The torment will strike them because of disbelieving in the Message of the Messengers, defying Allah's commands, committing what He prohibited and transgressing His set limits. "
