  28,73,"<h2>Night and Day are among the Blessings of Allah and are Signs of Tawhid</h2> Allah reminds His servants of His favors towards them by subjugating for them the night and day, without which they could not survive. He explains that if He made the night continuous, lasting until the Day of Resurrection, that would be harmful for them and would cause boredom and stress. So He says: ﴾مَنْ إِلَـهٌ غَيْرُ اللَّهِ يَأْتِيكُمْ بِضِيَآءٍ﴿ (which god besides Allah could bring you light) meaning, `with which you could see things and which would bring you relief' ﴾أَفَلاَ تَسْمَعُونَ﴿ (Will you not then hear) Then Allah tells us that if He had made the day continuous, lasting until the Day of Resurrection, that would also be harmful for them and their bodies would get tired from so much movement and activity. Allah says: ﴾مَنْ إِلَـهٌ غَيْرُ اللَّهِ يَأْتِيكُمْ بِلَيْلٍ تَسْكُنُونَ فِيهِ﴿ (which god besides Allah could bring you night wherein you rest) meaning, `to rest from your work and activity.' ﴾أَفلاَ تُبْصِرُونَوَمِن رَّحْمَتِهِ﴿ (Will you not then see It is out of His mercy) towards you, ﴾جَعَلَ لَكُمُ الَّيْلَ وَالنَّهَارَ﴿ (that He has made for you the night and the day) He created both, ﴾لِتَسْكُنُواْ فِيهِ﴿ (that you may rest therein) during the night, ﴾وَلِتَبْتَغُواْ مِن فَضْلِهِ﴿ (and that you may seek of His bounty) during the day, by traveling, moving about and working. ﴾وَلَعَلَّكُمْ تَشْكُرُونَ﴿ (and in order that you may be grateful.) So that you may give thanks to Allah by performing all kinds of acts of worship at night and during the day. Whoever misses something during the night can make it up during the day, and vice versa. This is like the Ayah, ﴾وَهُوَ الَّذِى جَعَلَ الَّيْلَ وَالنَّهَارَ خِلْفَةً لِّمَنْ أَرَادَ أَن يَذَّكَّرَ أَوْ أَرَادَ شُكُوراً ﴿ (And He it is Who has put the night and the day in succession, for such who desires to remember or desires to show his gratitude.) (25:62). And there are many similar Ayat. "

  28,75,"<h2>Rebuking the Idolators</h2> This is another call by way of rebuke for those who worshipped other gods besides Allah. The Lord, may He be exalted, will call to them before all the witnesses, and will say: ﴾أَيْنَ شُرَكَآئِىَ الَّذِينَ كُنتُمْ تَزْعُمُونَ﴿ (Where are My (so-called) partners, whom you used to assert) meaning, in this world. ﴾وَنَزَعْنَا مِن كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ شَهِيداً﴿ (And We shall take out from every nation a witness,) Mujahid said, \"This means a Messenger.\" ﴾فَقُلْنَا هَاتُواْ بُرْهَـنَكُمْ﴿ (and We shall say: \"Bring your proof.\") meaning, `of the truth of your claim that Allah had any partners.' ﴾فَعَلِمُواْ أَنَّ الْحَقَّ لِلَّهِ﴿ (Then they shall know that the truth is with Allah,) meaning, that there is no god besides Him. Then they will not speak and they will not be able to find any answer. ﴾وَضَلَّ عَنْهُمْ مَّا كَانُواْ يَفْتَرُونَ﴿ (and the lies which they invented will disappear from them.) they will vanish and will be of no benefit to them. "

  28,77,"<h2>Qarun and His People's exhortation</h2> It was recorded that Ibn `Abbas said: ﴾إِنَّ قَـرُونَ كَانَ مِن قَوْمِ مُوسَى﴿ (Verily, Qarun was of Musa's people,) \"He was the son of his paternal uncle.\" This was also the view of Ibrahim An-Nakha`i, `Abdullah bin Al-Harith bin Nawfal, Sammak bin Harb, Qatadah, Malik bin Dinar, Ibn Jurayj and others; they all said that he was the cousin of Musa, peace be upon him. Ibn Jurayj said: \"He was Qarun bin Yashar bin Qahith, and Musa was the son of `Imran bin Qahith. ﴾وَءَاتَيْنَاهُ مِنَ الْكُنُوزِ﴿ (And We gave him of the treasures,) meaning, of wealth; ﴾مَآ إِنَّ مَفَاتِحَهُ لَتَنُوأُ بِالْعُصْبَةِ أُوْلِى الْقُوَّةِ﴿ (that of which the keys would have been a burden to a body of strong men.) Groups of strong men would not have been able to carry them because they were so many. Al-A`mash narrated from Khaythamah, \"The keys of Qarun's treasure were made of leather, each key like a finger, and each key was for a separate storeroom. When he rode anywhere, the keys would be carried on sixty mules with white blazes on their foreheads and white feet.\" Other views were also given, and Allah knows best. ﴾إِذْ قَالَ لَهُ قَوْمُهُ لاَ تَفْرَحْ إِنَّ اللَّهَ لاَ يُحِبُّ الْفَرِحِينَ﴿ (Remember when his people said to him: \"Do not exult. Verily, Allah likes not those who exult.\") means, the righteous ones among his people exhorted him. By way of sincere advice and guidance, they said: \"Do not exult in what you have,\" meaning, `do not be arrogant and proud of your wealth.' ﴾إِنَّ اللَّهَ لاَ يُحِبُّ الْفَرِحِينَ﴿ (Verily, Allah likes not those who exult.) Ibn `Abbas said, \"This means, those who rejoice and gloat.\" Mujahid said, \"It means those who are insolent and reckless, and do not thank Allah for what He has given them.\" His saying: ﴾وَابْتَغِ فِيمَآ ءَاتَاكَ اللَّهُ الدَّارَ الاٌّخِرَةَ وَلاَ تَنسَ نَصِيبَكَ مِنَ الدُّنْيَا﴿ (But seek, with that which Allah has bestowed on you, the home of the Hereafter, and forget not your portion of lawful enjoyment in this world;) means, `use this great wealth and immense blessing Allah has given you to worship your Lord and draw closer to Him by doing a variety of good deeds which will earn you reward in this world and the Hereafter.' ﴾وَلاَ تَنسَ نَصِيبَكَ مِنَ الدُّنْيَا﴿ (and forget not your portion of lawful enjoyment in this world;) `That which Allah has permitted of food, drink, clothing, dwelling places and women. Your Lord has rights over you, your self has rights over you, your family has rights over you, and your visitors have rights over you. So give each of them their due.' ﴾وَأَحْسِن كَمَآ أَحْسَنَ اللَّهُ إِلَيْكَ﴿ (and be generous as Allah has been generous to you, ) `Be generous to His creatures, as He has been generous to you.' ﴾وَلاَ تَبْغِ الْفَسَادَ فِى الاٌّرْضِ﴿ (and seek not mischief in the land.) meaning: `do not let your aim be to spread corruption on earth and do harm to Allah's creation.' ﴾إِنَّ اللَّهَ لاَ يُحِبُّ الْمُفْسِدِينَ﴿ (Verily, Allah likes not the mischief-makers.)
