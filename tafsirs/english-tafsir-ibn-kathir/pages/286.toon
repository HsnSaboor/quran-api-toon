tafsir[11]{c,v,t}:
  17,39,"<h2>Everything previously mentioned is Revelation and Wisdom</h2> Allah says: `What We have commanded you to do is part of good manners, and what We have forbidden you are evil qualities. We have revealed this to you, O Muhammad, so that you may command the people likewise.' ﴾وَلاَ تَجْعَلْ مَعَ اللَّهِ إِلَـهًا ءَاخَرَ فَتُلْقَى فِى جَهَنَّمَ مَلُومًا﴿ (And set not up with Allah any other god lest you should be thrown into Hell, blameworthy) meaning, your own self will blame you, as will Allah and His creation. ﴾مَّدْحُورًا﴿ (rejected) means far removed from everything good. Ibn `Abbas and Qatadah said: \"(It means) cast out.\" This is an address to the Ummah via the Messenger , for he is infallible. "
  17,40,"<h2>Refutation of Those Who claim that the Angels are Daughters of Allah</h2> Allah refutes the lying idolators who claim, may the curse of Allah be upon them, that the angels are the daughters of Allah. They made the angels, who are the servants of Ar-Rahman (the Most Beneficent), females, and called them daughters of Allah, then they worshipped them. They were gravely wrong on all three counts. Allah says, denouncing them: ﴾أَفَأَصْفَـكُمْ رَبُّكُم بِالْبَنِينَ﴿ (Has then your Lord preferred for you sons,) meaning, has He given only you sons ﴾وَاتَّخَذَ مِنَ الْمَلَـئِكَةِ إِنَاثًا﴿ (and taken for Himself from among the angels daughters) meaning, has He chosen for Himself, as you claim, daughters Then Allah denounces them even more severely, and says: ﴾إِنَّكُمْ لَتَقُولُونَ قَوْلاً عَظِيمًا﴿ (Verily, you indeed utter an awful saying.) meaning, in your claim that Allah has children, then you say that His children are female, which you do not like for yourselves and may even kill them by burying them alive. That is indeed a division most unfair! Allah says: ﴾وَقَالُواْ اتَّخَذَ الرَّحْمَـنُ وَلَداً - لَقَدْ جِئْتُمْ شَيْئاً إِدّاً - تَكَادُ السَّمَـوَتُ يَتَفَطَّرْنَ مِنْهُ وَتَنشَقُّ الاٌّرْضُ وَتَخِرُّ الْجِبَالُ هَدّاً - أَن دَعَوْا لِلرَّحْمَـنِ وَلَداً - وَمَا يَنبَغِى لِلرَّحْمَـنِ أَن يَتَّخِذَ وَلَداً - إِن كُلُّ مَن فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ إِلاَّ آتِى الرَّحْمَـنِ عَبْداً - لَّقَدْ أَحْصَـهُمْ وَعَدَّهُمْ عَدّاً - وَكُلُّهُمْ ءَاتِيهِ يَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ فَرْداً ﴿ (And they say: \"The Most Beneficent (Allah) has begotten a child.\" Indeed you have brought forth (said) a terrible evil thing. Whereby the heavens are almost torn, and the earth split asunder, and the mountains fall in ruins. That they ascribe a son child to the Most Beneficent. But it is not suitable for (the majesty of) the Most Beneficent that he should beget a child. There is none in the heavens and the earth but comes unto the Most Beneficent as a servant. Verily, He knows each one of them, and has counted them a full counting. And every one of them will come to Him alone on the Day of Resurrection.) (19:88-95) "
  17,41,"﴾وَلَقَدْ صَرَّفْنَا فِى هَـذَا الْقُرْءَانِ﴿ (And surely, We have explained in this Qur'an) meaning, `We have explained Our warni- ngs so that they may remember the proof, evidence and exhorta- tions contained there- in, and be prevented from Shirk, wrong- doing and scandal.' ﴾وَمَا يَزِيدُهُمْ﴿ (but it increases them in naught) the wrong- doers among them ﴾إِلاَّ نُفُورًا﴿ (save aversion.) aversion towards the truth; they go further away from it. "
  17,42,"2072"
  17,43,"﴾سُبْحَانَهُ وَتَعَالَى عَمَّا يَقُولُونَ﴿ (Glorified and Exalted is He high above what they say!) meaning these idolators who transgress and do wrong when they claim that there are other gods besides Him. ﴾عُلُوّاً كَبِيراً﴿ (high above) means, far above. He is Allah, the One, the Self-Sufficient Master, Whom all creatures need. He begets not, nor was He begotten, and there is none comparable or coequal unto Him. "
  17,44,"<h2>Everything glorifies Allah</h2> Allah says: the seven heavens and the earth and all that is therein, meaning the creatures that dwell therein, sanctify Him, exalt Him, venerate Him, glorify Him and magnify Him far above what these idolators say, and they bear witness that He is One in His Lordship and Divinity. In everything there is a sign of Allah indicating that He is One. As Allah says:  تَكَادُ السَّمَـوَتُ يَتَفَطَّرْنَ مِنْهُ وَتَنشَقُّ الاٌّرْضُ وَتَخِرُّ الْجِبَالُ هَدّاً - أَن دَعَوْا لِلرَّحْمَـنِ وَلَداً  (Whereby the heavens are almost torn, and the earth is split asunder, and the mountains fall in ruins, That they ascribe child to the Most Beneficent) (19:90-91).  وَإِن مِّن شَىْءٍ إِلاَّ يُسَبِّحُ بِحَمْدَهِ  (and there is not a thing but glorifies His praise.) there is no created being that does not celebrate the praises of Allah.  وَلَـكِن لاَّ تَفْقَهُونَ تَسْبِيحَهُمْ  (But you understand not their glorification.) means, `You do not understand them, O mankind, because it is not like your languages.' This applies to all creatures generally, animal, inanimate and botanical. This is the better known of the two opinions according to the most reliable of two opinions. It was reported in Sahih Al-Bukhari that Ibn Mas`ud said: \"We used to hear the Tasbih of the food as it was being eaten. \" Imam Ahmad recorded that Mu`adh bin Anas said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ came upon some people who were sitting on their mounts and talking to one another. He said to them:  «ارْكَبُوهَا سَالِمَةً وَدَعُوهَا سَالِمَةً، وَلَا تَتَّخِذُوهَا كَرَاسِيَّ لِأَحَادِيثِكُمْ فِي الطُّرُقِ وَالْأَسْوَاقِ، فَرُبَّ مَرْكُوبَةٍ خَيْرٌ مِنْ رَاكِبِهَا، وَأَكْثَرُ ذِكْرًااِللهِ مِنْه»  (Ride them safely then leave them safely. Do not use them as chairs for you to have conversations in the streets and marketplaces, because the one that is ridden may be better than the one who rides it, and may remember Allah more than he does.) An-Nasa'i recorded in his Sunan that `Abdullah bin `Amr said: \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ forbade us from killing frogs.\"  إِنَّهُ كَانَ حَلِيمًا غَفُورًا  (Truly, He is Ever Forbearing, Oft-Forgiving.) means, He does not hasten to punish those who disobey Him, rather He gives them time and waits, then if they persist in their stubborn Kufr, He seizes them with a punishment of the All-Mighty, All-Capable. It was recorded in the Two Sahihs that:  «إِنَّ اللهَ لَيُمْلِي لِلظَّالِمِ حَتَّى إِذَا أَخَذَهُ لَمْ يُفْلِتْه»  (Allah will let the wrongdoer carry on until, when He does seize him, He will never let him go.) Then the Messenger of Allah ﷺ recited:  وَكَذلِكَ أَخْذُ رَبِّكَ إِذَا أَخَذَ الْقُرَى وَهِىَ ظَـلِمَةٌ  (Such is the punishment of your Lord when He seizes the (population of) towns while they are doing wrong. ) 11:02 Allah says:  وَكَأَيِّن مِّن قَرْيَةٍ أَمْلَيْتُ لَهَا وَهِىَ ظَـلِمَةٌ  (And many a township did I give respite while it was given to wrongdoing.) 22:45 until the end of two Ayat.  فَكَأَيِّن مِّن قَرْيَةٍ أَهْلَكْنَـهَا وَهِىَ ظَالِمَةٌ  (And many a township did We destroy while they were given to wrongdoing.) 22:48 Whoever gives up his disbelief and disobedience, and turns back to Allah in repentance, Allah will accept his repentance, as He says:  وَمَن يَعْمَلْ سُوءاً أَوْ يَظْلِمْ نَفْسَهُ ثُمَّ يَسْتَغْفِرِ اللَّهَ  (And whoever does evil or wrongs himself but afterwards seeks Allah's forgiveness) 4:110 Here, Allah says:  إِنَّهُ كَانَ حَلِيمًا غَفُورًا  (Truly, He is Ever Forbearing, Oft-Forgiving.) At the end of Surah Fatir, He says:  إِنَّ اللَّهَ يُمْسِكُ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضَ أَن تَزُولاَ وَلَئِن زَالَتَآ إِنْ أَمْسَكَهُمَا مِنْ أَحَدٍ مِّن بَعْدِهِ إِنَّهُ كَانَ حَلِيماً غَفُوراً  (Verily, Allah grasps the heavens and the earth lest they should move away from their places, and if they were to move away from their places, there is not one that could grasp them after Him. Truly, He is Ever Most Forbearing, Oft-Forgiving...) until His saying;  وَلَوْ يُؤَاخِذُ اللَّهُ النَّاسَ  (And if Allah were to punish men)(35:41-45) "

  17,46,"<h2>The Veil over the Hearts of the Idolators</h2> Allah says to His Messenger Muhammad : `When you recite Qur'an to these idolators, We put an invisible veil between you and them.' Qatadah and Ibn Zayd said, \"It is coverings over their hearts,\" as Allah says: ﴾وَقَالُواْ قُلُوبُنَا فِى أَكِنَّةٍ مِمَّا تَدْعُونَا إِلَيْهِ وَفِى ءَاذانِنَا وَقْرٌ وَمِن بَيْنِنَا وَبَيْنِكَ حِجَابٌ﴿ (And they say: \"Our hearts are under coverings (screened) from that to which you invite us; and in our ears is deafness, and between us and you is a screen) meaning, there is something that is stopping and preventing your words from reaching us. ﴾حِجَابًا مَّسْتُورًا﴿ (an invisible veil.) meaning something which covers, or that cannot be seen, so there is a barrier between them and guidance. This is the interpretation that Ibn Jarir (may Allah have mercy on him) thought was correct. Al-Hafiz Abu Ya`la Al-Mawusili recorded that Asma' bint Abi Bakr (may Allah be pleased with her) said, \"When the Ayah, ﴾تَبَّتْ يَدَآ أَبِى لَهَبٍ وَتَبَّ ﴿ (Perish the two hands of Abu Lahab and perish he!) (111:1) was revealed, the one-eyed woman Umm Jamil the wife of Abu Lahab came with a stone pestle in her hand, screaming, `What was sent to us is somebody blameworthy, or, we reject somebody blameworthy Abu Musa - one of the narrators - said, it is I who am not sure what was said; we shun his religion and disobey whatever he commands!' The Messenger of Allah was sitting with Abu Bakr by his side. Abu Bakr, may Allah be pleased with him, said, `This woman has come and I am afraid she will see you.' The Prophet said, ﴾«إِنَّهَا لَنْ تَرَانِي»﴿ (Certainly she will not see me.) and he recited Qur'an through which he was protected from her: ﴾وَإِذَا قَرَأْتَ الْقُرءَانَ جَعَلْنَا بَيْنَكَ وَبَيْنَ الَّذِينَ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِالاٌّخِرَةِ حِجَابًا مَّسْتُورًا ﴿ (And when you recite the Qur'an, We put between you and those who believe not in the Hereafter, an invisible veil). She came and found Abu Bakr, but she did not see the Prophet . She said, `O Abu Bakr, I have heard that your companion is lampooning me.' Abu Bakr said, `No, by the Lord of this House the Ka`bah, he is not lampooning you.' Then she went away, saying, `The Quraysh know that I am the daughter of their master.\"' ﴾وَجَعَلْنَا عَلَى قُلُوبِهِمْ أَكِنَّةً﴿ (And We have put coverings over their hearts,) Akinnah (coverings) is the plural of Kinan, which covers the heart. ﴾أَن يَفْقَهُوهُ﴿ (lest they should understand it,) means, lest they should understand the Qur'an. ﴾وَفِى ءَاذَانِهِمْ وَقْرًا﴿ (and in their ears deafness) something that will stop them from hearing the Qur'an in such a way that they will understand it and be guided by it. ﴾وَإِذَا ذَكَرْتَ رَبَّكَ فِى الْقُرْءَانِ وَحْدَهُ﴿ (And when you make mention of your Lord Alone in the Qur'an,) means, when you declare Allah to be One in your recitation, and say La Ilaha Illallah, ﴾وَلَّوْاْ﴿ (they turn) means they turn away ﴾عَلَى أَدْبَـرِهِمْ نُفُوراً﴿ (on their backs, fleeing in extreme dislike.) As Allah says: ﴾وَإِذَا ذُكِرَ اللَّهُ وَحْدَهُ اشْمَأَزَّتْ قُلُوبُ الَّذِينَ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِالاٌّخِرَةِ﴿ (And when Allah Alone is mentioned, the hearts of those who believe not in the Hereafter are filled with disgust (from the Oneness of Allah).) 39:45 z ﴾وَإِذَا ذَكَرْتَ رَبَّكَ فِى الْقُرْءَانِ﴿ (And when you make mention of your Lord Alone in the Qur'an,) Commenting on this Ayah, Qatadah said that when the Muslims said La Ilaha Illallah, the idolators disliked this and found it intolerable. Iblis and his troops hated it, but Allah insisted on supporting it so that it would prevail over those who opposed it. Whoever uses it against his opponent will prevail, and whoever fights for it will be victorious. Only the Muslims of the Arabian Peninsula, which can be traversed by a rider in a few nights, knew it and accepted it, out of all mankind. "

  17,48,"<h2>The Secret Counsel of Quraysh after hearing the Qur'an</h2> Allah tells His Prophet about what the leaders of Quraysh discussed when they came and listened to him reciting Qur'an in secret, without their people knowing about it. They said that he was Mashur which according to the better-known view means someone affected by magic (Sihr); it may also mean a man who has a lung, i.e., a mere human being, as if they were saying that if you follow Muhammad, you will only be following a human being. This second suggestion does not sound correct, because what they meant here was that he was under the influence of Sihr (magic) which made him see dreams in which he learned these words that he recited. Some of them said he was a poet, or a soothsayer, or crazy, or a sorcerer. Allah says:  انْظُرْ كَيْفَ ضَرَبُواْ لَكَ الاٌّمْثَالَ فَضَلُّواْ فَلاَ يَسْتَطِيعْونَ سَبِيلاً  (See what examples they have put forward for you. So they have gone astray, and never can they find a way.) meaning, they will never be guided to the truth and will never find a way to reach it. Muhammad bin Ishaq said in As-Sirah: \"Muhammad bin Muslim bin Shihab Az-Zuhri told me that it happened that Abu Sufyan bin Harb, Abu Jahl bin Hisham and Al-Akhnas bin Shurayq bin `Amr bin Wahb Ath-Thaqafi, the ally of Bani Zahrah, went out one night to listen to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ when he was praying at night in his house. Each one of them took up a position for listening, and none of them knew that the others were also there. They stayed listening to him all night until dawn came. When they left, they met up on the road, each of them blaming the others, saying to one another; `Do not come back again, lest you give the wrong impression i.e., that you like what you hear.' Then they went away until the second night came, when each of them came back to his place and spent the night listening. When dawn came they left, then when they met up on the road, each of them blamed the others, saying the same as they had said the previous night. Then they went away until the third night came, when each of them came back to his place and spent the night listening. When dawn came they left, then when they met up on the road, they said to one another, `Let us not leave until we promise not to come back,' so they made a promise to that effect, and went their separate ways. In the morning, Al-Akhnas bin Shurayq took his stick and went to the house of Abu Sufyan bin Harb, where he said, `Tell me, O Abu Hanzalah i.e., Abu Sufyan, what do you think of what you have heard from Muhammad' Abu Sufyan said, `O Abu Tha`labah i.e., Al-Akhnas, by Allah, I have heard something I understand and I know what is meant by it, and I have heard things I do not understand and do not know what is meant by it.' Al-Akhnas said: `Me too, by the One by Whom you swore.' Then he left and went to Abu Jahl, and entered his house. He said, `O Abu Al-Hakam i.e., Abu Jahl, what do you think of what you have heard from Muhammad' He said, `What did you hear' He said, `We and Banu `Abd Manaf competed for honor and position: they fed people so we fed people, they engaged in battle so we engaged in battle, they gave so we gave, until we were neck and neck, like race horses. Then they said, we have a Prophet among us who receives revelation from heaven. How could we compete with that By Allah we will never believe in him.' Then Al-Akhnas got up and left him.\" "
