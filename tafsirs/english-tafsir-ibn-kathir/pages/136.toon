tafsir[5]{c,v,t}:
  6,69,"<h2>The Invitation to the Truth is Guidance Without Coercion</h2> Allah said,  ﴾وَكَذَّبَ بِهِ﴿ (But have denied it) denied the Qur'an, guidance and clear explanation that you (O Muhammad ) have brought them,  ﴾قَوْمُكَ ﴿ (your people) meaning, Quraysh,  ﴾وَهُوَ الْحَقُّ﴿ (though it is the truth.) beyond which there is no other truth.  ﴾قُل لَّسْتُ عَلَيْكُمْ بِوَكِيلٍ﴿ (Say: \"I am not responsible for your affairs.\") meaning, I have not been appointed a guardian or watcher over you. Allah also said;  ﴾وَقُلِ الْحَقُّ مِن رَّبِّكُمْ فَمَن شَآءَ فَلْيُؤْمِن وَمَن شَآءَ فَلْيَكْفُرْ﴿ (And say: \"The truth is from your Lord.\" Then whosoever wills, let him believe, and whosoever wills, let him disbelieve.) 18:29, This means, my duty is to convey the Message and your duty is to hear and obey. Those who follow me, will acquire happiness in this life and the Hereafter. Those who defy me will become miserable in this life and the Hereafter. So Allah said;  ﴾لِّكُلِّ نَبَإٍ مُّسْتَقَرٌّ﴿ (For every news there is a reality...) meaning, for every news, there is a reality, in that, this news will occur, perhaps after a while, according to Ibn `Abbas and others. Allah said in other Ayat,  ﴾وَلَتَعْلَمُنَّ نَبَأَهُ بَعْدَ حِينِ ﴿ (And you shall certainly know the truth of it after a while.) 38:88 and,  ﴾لِكُلِّ أَجَلٍ كِتَابٌ﴿ ((For) each and every matter there is a decree (from Allah).) 13:38. This, indeed, is a warning and a promise that will surely occur,  ﴾وَسَوْفَ تَعْلَمُونَ﴿ (and you will come to know.) Allah's statement,  ﴾وَإِذَا رَأَيْتَ الَّذِينَ يَخُوضُونَ فِى ءَايَـتِنَا﴿ (And when you see those who engage in false conversation about Our verses (of the Qur'an)), by denying and mocking them.  <h2>The Prohibition of Sitting with Those Who Deny and Mock Allah's Ayat</h2>﴾فَأَعْرِضْ عَنْهُمْ حَتَّى يَخُوضُواْ فِى حَدِيثٍ غَيْرِهِ﴿ (stay away from them till they turn to another topic.) until they talk about a subject other than the denial they were engaged in.  ﴾وَإِمَّا يُنسِيَنَّكَ الشَّيْطَـنُ﴿ (And if Shaytan causes you to forget...) This command includes every member of this Ummah. No one is to sit with those who deny and distort Allah's Ayat and explain them incorrectly. If one forgets and sits with such people,  ﴾فَلاَ تَقْعُدْ بَعْدَ الذِّكْرَى﴿ (then after the remembrance sit not you) after you remember,  ﴾مَعَ الْقَوْمِ الظَّـلِمِينَ﴿ (in the company of those people who are the wrongdoers.). A Hadith states,  ﴾«رُفِعَ عَنْ أُمَّتِي الْخَطَأُ وَالنِّسْيَانُ وَمَا اسْتُكْرِهُوا عَلَيْه»﴿ (My Ummah was forgiven unintentional errors, forgetfulness and what they are coerced to do.) The Ayah above 6:68 is the Ayah mentioned in Allah's statement,  ﴾وَقَدْ نَزَّلَ عَلَيْكُمْ فِى الْكِتَـبِ أَنْ إِذَا سَمِعْتُمْ ءَايَـتِ اللَّهِ يُكَفَرُ بِهَا وَيُسْتَهْزَأُ بِهَا فَلاَ تَقْعُدُواْ مَعَهُمْ حَتَّى يَخُوضُواْ فِى حَدِيثٍ غَيْرِهِ إِنَّكُمْ إِذاً مِّثْلُهُمْ﴿ (And it has already been revealed to you in the Book that when you hear the Verses of Allah being denied and mocked at, then sit not with them, until they engage in a talk other than that; (but if you stayed with them) certainly in that case you would be like them.) 4:140, for, if you still sit with them, agreeing to what they say, you will be just like them. Allah's statement,  ﴾وَمَا عَلَى الَّذِينَ يَتَّقُونَ مِنْ حِسَابِهِم مِّن شَىْءٍ﴿ (There is no responsibility for them upon those who have Taqwa,) means, when the believers avoid sitting with wrongdoers in this case, they will be innocent of them and they will have saved themselves from their sin. Allah's statement,  ﴾وَلَـكِن ذِكْرَى لَعَلَّهُمْ يَتَّقُونَ﴿ (but (their duty) is to remind them, that they may avoid that.), means, We commanded you to ignore and avoid them, so that they become aware of the error they are indulging in, that they may avoid this behavior and never repeat it again.  "
  6,70,"﴾وَذَرِ الَّذِينَ اتَّخَذُواْ دِينَهُمْ لَعِباً وَلَهْواً وَغَرَّتْهُمُ الْحَيَوةُ الدُّنْيَا﴿ (And leave alone those who take their religion as play and amusement, and are deceived by the life of this world.) The Ayah commands to leave such people, ignore them and give them respite, for soon, they will taste a tremendous torment. This is why Allah said,  ﴾وَذَكِّرْ بِهِ﴿ (But remind with it) meaning, remind the people with this Qur'an and warn them against Allah's revenge and painful torment on the Day of Resurrection. Allah said;  ﴾أَن تُبْسَلَ نَفْسٌ بِمَا كَسَبَتْ﴿ (lest a soul Tubsal for that which one has earned,) meaning, so that it is not Tubsal. Ad-Dahhak from Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Al-Hasan and As-Suddi said that Tubsal means, be submissive. Al-Walibi said that Ibn `Abbas said that Tubsal means, `be exposed'. Qatadah said that Tubsal means, `be prevented', Murrah and Ibn Zayd said that it means, `be recompensed', Al-Kalbi said, `be reckoned'. All these statements and expressions are similar, for they all mean exposure to destruction, being kept away from all that is good, and being restrained from attaining what is desired. Allah also said;  ﴾كُلُّ نَفْسٍ بِمَا كَسَبَتْ رَهِينَةٌ - إِلاَّ أَصْحَـبَ الْيَمِينِ ﴿ (Every person is restrained by what he has earned. Except those on the Right.) 74:38-39, and  ﴾لَيْسَ لَهَا مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ وَلِىٌّ وَلاَ شَفِيعٌ﴿ (when he will find for himself no protector or intercessor besides Allah,) and,  ﴾وَإِن تَعْدِلْ كُلَّ عَدْلٍ لاَّ يُؤْخَذْ مِنْهَآ﴿ (and even if he offers every ransom, it will not be accepted from him.) meaning, whatever the ransom such people offer, it will not be accepted from them. Allah said in a similar statement,  ﴾إِنَّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ وَمَاتُواْ وَهُمْ كُفَّارٌ فَلَن يُقْبَلَ مِنْ أَحَدِهِم مِّلْءُ الاٌّرْضِ ذَهَبًا﴿ (Verily, those who disbelieved, and died while they were disbelievers, the (whole) earth full of gold will not be accepted from anyone of them.) 3:91 Allah said here,  ﴾أُوْلَـئِكَ الَّذِينَ أُبْسِلُواْ بِمَا كَسَبُواْ لَهُمْ شَرَابٌ مِّنْ حَمِيمٍ وَعَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ بِمَا كَانُواْ يَكْفُرُونَ﴿ (Such are they who are given up to destruction because of that which they have earned. For them will be a drink of boiling water and a painful torment because they used to disbelieve. )  "

  6,73,"<h2>The Parable of Those Who Revert to Disbelief After Faith and Good Deeds</h2> As-Suddi said, \"Some idolators said to some Muslims, `Follow us and abandon the religion of Muhammad ﷺ.' Allah sent down the revelation,  قُلْ أَنَدْعُواْ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ مَا لاَ يَنفَعُنَا وَلاَ يَضُرُّنَا وَنُرَدُّ عَلَى أَعْقَـبِنَا  (Say: \"Shall we invoke others besides Allah, that can do us neither good nor harm, and shall we turn on our heels...\") by reverting to disbelief,  بَعْدَ إِذْ هَدَانَا اللَّهُ  (\"...after Allah has guided us.\") for if we do this, our example will be like he whom the devils have caused to wander in confusion throughout the land. Allah says here, your example, if you revert to disbelief after you believed, is that of a man who went with some people on a road, but he lost his way and the devils led him to wander in confusion over the land. Meanwhile, his companions on the road were calling him to come to them saying, `Come back to us, for we are on the path.' But, he refused to go back to them. This is the example of he who follows the devil after recognizing Muhammad ﷺ, and Muhammad ﷺ is the person who is calling the people to the path, and the path is Islam.\" Ibn Jarir recorded this statement.Allah's statement, j  كَالَّذِى اسْتَهْوَتْهُ الشَّيَـطِينُ فِى الاٌّرْضِ  (Like one whom the Shayatin (devils) have made to go astray (wandering) through the land, ) refers to ghouls,  يَدْعُونَهُ  (calling him) by his name, his father's and his grandfather's names. So he follows the devils' call thinking that it is a path of guidance, but by the morning he will find himself destroyed and perhaps they eat him. The Jinns will then let him wander in a wasteland where he will die of thirst. This is the example of those who follow the false gods that are being worshipped instead of Allah, Most Honored. Ibn Jarir also recorded this. Allah said,  قُلْ إِنَّ هُدَى اللَّهِ هُوَ الْهُدَى  (Say: \"Verily, Allah's guidance is the only guidance,\") Allah said in other instances,  وَمَن يَهْدِ اللَّهُ فَمَا لَهُ مِن مُّضِلٍّ  (And whomsoever Allah guides, for him there will be none to misguide him.) 39:37, and,  إِن تَحْرِصْ عَلَى هُدَاهُمْ فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ لاَ يَهْدِى مَن يُضِلُّ وَمَا لَهُمْ مِّن نَّـصِرِينَ  (If you covet for their guidance, then verily Allah guides not those whom He makes to go astray. And they will have no helpers.) 17:37 Allah's statement,  وَأُمِرْنَا لِنُسْلِمَ لِرَبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ  (and we have been commanded to submit to the Lord of all that exists.) means, we were commanded to worship Allah in sincerity to Him alone, without partners.  وَأَنْ أَقِيمُواْ الصَّلوةَ وَاتَّقُوهُ  (And to perform the Salah, and have Taqwa of Him.) meaning, we were commanded to perform the prayer and to fear Allah in all circumstances,  وَهُوَ الَّذِى إِلَيْهِ تُحْشَرُونَ  (and it is He to Whom you shall be gathered.) on the Day of Resurrection.  وَهُوَ الَّذِى خَلَقَ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضَ بِالْحَقِّ  (It is He Who has created the heavens and the earth in truth.) meaning, in justice, and He is their Originator and Owner Who governs their affairs and the affairs of their inhabitants. Allah said,  وَيَوْمَ يَقُولُ كُن فَيَكُونُ  (and on the Day He will say: \"Be!\" it shall become.) Referring to the Day of Resurrection, which will come faster than the blink of an eye, when Allah says to it, `Be.' <h2>As-Sur; The Trumpet</h2> Allah's statement,  يَوْمَ يُنفَخُ فِى الصُّوَرِ  (on the Day when the Sur will be blown...) refers to His statement,  وَيَوْمَ يَقُولُ كُن فَيَكُونُ  (and on the Day He will say: \"Be!\" it shall become.) as we stated above. Or, it means,  وَلَهُ الْمُلْكُ يَوْمَ يُنفَخُ فِى الصُّوَرِ  (His will be the dominion on the Day when the Sur will be blown.) Allah said in other Ayat,  لِّمَنِ الْمُلْكُ الْيَوْمَ لِلَّهِ الْوَحِدِ الْقَهَّارِ  (Whose is the kingdom this Day It is Allah's, the One, the Irresistible!) 40:16, and,  الْمُلْكُ يَوْمَئِذٍ الْحَقُّ لِلرَّحْمَـنِ وَكَانَ يَوْماً عَلَى الْكَـفِرِينَ عَسِيراً  (The sovereignty on that Day will be the true (sovereignty), belonging to the Most Beneficent (Allah), and it will be a hard Day for the disbelievers.) 25:26 The Sur is the Trumpet into which the angel Israfil, peace be upon him, will blow. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,  «إِنَّ إِسْرَافِيلَ قَدِ الْتَقَمَ الصُّورَ، وَحَنَى جَبْهَتَهُ يَنْتَظِرُ مَتَى يُؤْمَر فَيَنْفُخ»  (Israfil has held the Sur in his mouth and lowered his forehead, awaiting the command to blow in it.) Muslim recorded this Hadith in his Sahih. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin `Amr said, \"A bedouin man said, `O Allah's Messenger! What is the Sur' He said,  «قَرْنٌ يُنْفَخُ فِيه»  (A Trumpet which will be blown.)\" "
