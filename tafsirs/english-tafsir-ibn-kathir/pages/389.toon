  28,32,"<h2>Musa's Return to Egypt and how he was honored with the Mission and Miracles on the Way</h2> In the explanation of the previous Ayah, we have already seen that Musa completed the longer and better of the two terms, which may also be understood from the Ayah where Allah says: ﴾فَلَمَّا قَضَى مُوسَى الاٌّجَلَ﴿ (Then, when Musa had fulfilled the term,) meaning, the longer of the two; and Allah knows best. ﴾وَسَارَ بِأَهْلِهِ﴿ (and was traveling with his family,) They said: \"Musa missed his country and his relatives, so he resolved to visit them in secret, without Fir`awn and his people knowing. So he gathered up his family and the flocks which his father-in-law had given to him, and set out on a cold, dark, rainy night. They stopped to camp, and whenever he tried to start a fire, he did not succeed. He was surprised by this, and while he was in this state, ﴾ءَانَسَ مِن جَانِبِ الطُّورِ نَاراً﴿ (he saw a fire in the direction of At-Tur) he saw a fire burning from a far. ﴾فَقَالَ لاًّهْلِهِ امْكُثُواْ إِنِّى ءَانَسْتُ نَاراً﴿ (He said to his family: \"Wait, I have seen a fire...\") meaning, `wait while I go there, ' ﴾لَّعَلِّى ءَاتِيكُمْ مِّنْهَا بِخَبَرٍ﴿ (perhaps I may bring to you from there some information,) This was because they lost their way. ﴾أَوْ جَذْوَةٍ مِّنَ النَّارِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَصْطَلُونَ﴿ (or a burning firebrand that you may warm yourselves.) so that they could get warm and find relief from the cold. ﴾فَلَمَّآ أَتَـهَا نُودِىَ مِن شَاطِىءِ الْوَادِى الأَيْمَنِ﴿ (So when he reached it (the fire), he was called from the right side of the valley,) From the side of the valley that adjoined the mountain on his right, to the west. This is like the Ayah, ﴾وَمَا كُنتَ بِجَانِبِ الْغَرْبِىِّ إِذْ قَضَيْنَآ إِلَى مُوسَى الاٌّمْرَ﴿ (And you were not on the western side, when We made clear to Musa the commandment) (20:44). This indicates that when Musa headed for the fire, he headed in the direction of the Qiblah with the western mountain on his right. He found the fire burning in a green bush on the side of the mountain adjoining the valley, and he stood there amazed at what he was seeing. Then his Lord called him: ﴾مِن شَاطِىءِ الْوَادِى الأَيْمَنِ فِى الْبُقْعَةِ الْمُبَارَكَةِ مِنَ الشَّجَرَةِ﴿ (from the right side of the valley, in the blessed place, from the tree.) ﴾أَن يمُوسَى إِنِّى أَنَا اللَّهُ رَبُّ الْعَـلَمِينَ﴿ (O Musa! Verily, I am Allah, the Lord of all that exits!) meaning, `the One Who is addressing you and speaking to you is the Lord of all that exits, the One Who does what He wills, the One apart from Whom there is no other god or lord, may He be exalted and sanctified, the One Who by His very nature, attributes, words and deeds is far above any resemblance to His creation, may He be glorified. ﴾وَأَنْ أَلْقِ عَصَاكَ﴿ (And throw your stick!) `the stick that is in your hand' -- as was stated in the Ayah, ﴾وَمَا تِلْكَ بِيَمِينِكَ يمُوسَى - قَالَ هِىَ عَصَاىَ أَتَوَكَّؤُا عَلَيْهَا وَأَهُشُّ بِهَا عَلَى غَنَمِى وَلِىَ فِيهَا مَأَرِبُ أُخْرَى ﴿ (\"And what is that in your right hand, O Musa\" He said: \"This is my stick, whereon I lean, and wherewith I beat down branches for my sheep, and wherein I find other uses.\") (20:17-18). The meaning is: `this stick, which you know so well;' ﴾قَالَ أَلْقِهَا يمُوسَى - فَأَلْقَـهَا فَإِذَا هِىَ حَيَّةٌ تَسْعَى ﴿ (\"Cast it down, O Musa!\" He cast it down, and behold! It was a snake, moving quickly.) (20:19-20). Musa knew that the One Who was speaking to him was the One Who merely says to a thing, \"Be!\" and it is, as we have already stated in (the explanation of) Surah Ta Ha. And here Allah says: ﴾فَلَمَّا رَءَاهَا تَهْتَزُّ كَأَنَّهَا جَآنٌّ وَلَّى مُدْبِراً﴿ (But when he saw it moving as if it were a snake, he turned in flight,) It moved so quickly, even though it was so big, and its mouth was so huge, with its jaws snapping. It swallowed every rock it passed, and every rock that fell into its mouth fell with a sound like a rock falling into a valley. When he saw that: ﴾وَلَّى مُدْبِراً وَلَمْ يُعَقِّبْ﴿ (he turned in flight, and looked not back.) he did not turn around, because it is human nature to flee from such a thing. But when Allah said to him: ﴾يمُوسَى أَقْبِلْ وَلاَ تَخَفْ إِنَّكَ مِنَ الاٌّمِنِينَ﴿ (O Musa! Draw near, and fear not. Verily, you are of those who are secure.) he came back to his original position. Then Allah said: ﴾اسْلُكْ يَدَكَ فِى جَيْبِكَ تَخْرُجْ بَيْضَآءَ مِنْ غَيْرِ سُوءٍ﴿ (Put your hand into the opening of your garment, it will come forth white without a disease;) meaning, `when you put your hand in your garment and then draw it out, it will be shining white as if it were a piece of the moon or a flash of lightning.' Allah said: ﴾مِنْ غَيْرِ سُوءٍ﴿ (without a disease) i.e., with no trace of leukoderma. ﴾وَاضْمُمْ إِلَيْكَ جَنَاحَكَ مِنَ الرَّهْبِ﴿ (and draw your hand close to your side to be free from the fear.) Mujahid said, \"To be free from terror.\" Qatadah said, \"To be free from fear.\" Musa was commanded, when he felt afraid of anything, to draw his hand close to his side to be free from the fear. If he did that, whatever fear he felt would be gone. Perhaps if a person does this, following the example of Musa, and puts his hand over his heart, his fear will disappear or be lessened, if Allah wills; in Allah we place our trust. ﴾فَذَانِكَ بُرْهَانَـنِ مِن رَّبِّكَ﴿ (These are two proofs from your Lord) This refers to the throwing down of his stick, whereupon it turned into a moving snake, and his putting his hand into his garment and bringing it forth white without a disease. These were two clear and definitive proofs of the power of the One Who does as He chooses, and of the truth of the prophethood of the one at whose hands these miracles occurred. Allah said: ﴾إِلَى فِرْعَوْنَ وَمَلإِيْهِ﴿ (to Fir`awn and his chiefs.) meaning his leaders and prominent followers. ﴾إِنَّهُمْ كَانُواْ قَوْماً فَـسِقِينَ﴿ (Verily, they are the people who are rebellious.) means, who are disobedient towards Allah and who go against His commands and His religion.

  28,35,"<h2>How Musa asked for the Support of His Brother and was granted that by Allah</h2> When Allah commanded him to go to Fir`awn, the one who he had run away from and whose vengeance he feared, ﴾قَالَ رَبِّ إِنِّى قَتَلْتُ مِنْهُمْ نَفْساً﴿ ( Musa said: My Lord! I have killed a man among them,) meaning, that Coptic, ﴾فَأَخَافُ أَن يَقْتُلُونِ﴿ (and I fear that they will kill me.) i.e., `when they see me.' ﴾وَأَخِى هَـرُونُ هُوَ أَفْصَحُ مِنِّى لِسَاناً﴿ (And my brother Harun -- he is more eloquent in speech than me,) Musa, peace be upon him, had a speech defect, because when he had been given the choice between a date and a pearl, he mistakenly picked up a coal and placed it on his tongue, so he found it difficult to speak clearly. Musa said: ﴾وَاحْلُلْ عُقْدَةً مِّن لِّسَانِى - يَفْقَهُواْ قَوْلِي - وَاجْعَل لِّى وَزِيراً مِّنْ أَهْلِى - هَـرُونَ أَخِى - اشْدُدْ بِهِ أَزْرِى - وَأَشْرِكْهُ فِى أَمْرِى ﴿ (\"And loose the knot (the defect) from my tongue. That they understand my speech. And appoint for me a helper from my family, Harun, my brother. Increase my strength with him, And let him share my task.\") (20:27-32) meaning, `give me someone to keep me company in this immense task of prophethood and conveying the Message to this arrogant, tyrannical and stubborn king. ' Hence Musa said: ﴾وَأَخِى هَـرُونُ هُوَ أَفْصَحُ مِنِّى لِسَاناً فَأَرْسِلْهِ مَعِىَ رِدْءاً﴿ (And my brother Harun -- he is more eloquent in speech than me: so send him with me as a helper) meaning, as a support to give strength to my cause and confirm what I say and convey from Allah, because the word of two carries more weight in people's minds than the word of one. So he said: ﴾إِنِّى أَخَافُ أَن يُكَذِّبُونِ﴿ (Verily, I fear that they will deny me.) Muhammad bin Ishaq said: c ﴾رِدْءاً يُصَدِّقُنِى﴿ (as a helper to confirm me.) means, `to explain to them what I say, for he can understand me where they may not.' When Musa asked for this, Allah said to him: ﴾سَنَشُدُّ عَضُدَكَ بِأَخِيكَ﴿ (We will strengthen your arm through your brother,) meaning, `We will add strength to your cause and give you help through your brother, who you have asked to be made a Prophet alongside you.' This is like the Ayat; ﴾قَدْ أُوتِيتَ سُؤْلَكَ يمُوسَى﴿ (You are granted your request, O Musa!) (20:36) ﴾وَوَهَبْنَا لَهُ مِن رَّحْمَتِنَآ أَخَاهُ هَـرُونَ نَبِيّاً ﴿ (And We granted him his brother Harun, (also) a Prophet, out of Our mercy) (19:53). One of the Salaf said, \"There is no one who has ever done a greater favor to his brother than Musa did for Harun, may peace be upon them both, for he interceded for him until Allah made him a Prophet and Messenger with him to Fir`awn and his chiefs. Allah said concerning Musa: ﴾وَكَانَ عِندَ اللَّهِ وَجِيهاً﴿ (he was honorable before Allah) (33:69). ﴾وَنَجْعَلُ لَكُمَا سُلْطَـناً﴿ (and (We will) give you both power) means, overwhelming evidence. ﴾فَلاَ يَصِلُونَ إِلَيْكُمَا بِـْايَـتِنَآ﴿ (so they shall not be able to harm you, with Our Ayat;) means, `they will have no way or means of harming you because you are conveying the signs of Allah.' This is like the Ayat: ﴾يَـأَيُّهَا الرَّسُولُ بَلِّغْ مَآ أُنزِلَ إِلَيْكَ مِن رَّبِّكَ﴿ (O Messenger! Proclaim (the Message) which has been sent down to you from your Lord.) until His saying: ﴾وَاللَّهُ يَعْصِمُكَ مِنَ النَّاسِ﴿ (Allah will protect you from mankind) (5:67). ﴾الَّذِينَ يُبَلِّغُونَ رِسَالـتِ اللَّهِ﴿ (Those who convey the Message of Allah) until His saying: ﴾وَكَفَى بِاللَّهِ حَسِيباً﴿ (And sufficient is Allah as a Reckoner) (33:39). And sufficient is Allah as a Helper and Supporter. And Allah told them the consequences in this world and the next, for them and for those who followed them, ﴾أَنتُمَا وَمَنِ اتَّبَعَكُمَا الْغَـلِبُونَ﴿ (you two as well as those who follow you will be the victors.) This is like the Ayat: ﴾كَتَبَ اللَّهُ لاّغْلِبَنَّ أَنَاْ وَرُسُلِى إِنَّ اللَّهَ قَوِىٌّ عَزِيزٌ ﴿ (Allah has decreed: \"Verily, it is I and My Messengers who shall be the victorious.\" Verily, Allah is All-Powerful, All-Mighty.) (58:21) ﴾إِنَّا لَنَنصُرُ رُسُلَنَا وَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ فِى الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا﴿ (Verily, We will indeed make victorious Our Messengers and those who believe in this world's life) (40:51) to the end of the Ayah.
