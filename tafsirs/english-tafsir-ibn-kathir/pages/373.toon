  26,140,"<h2>The Response of the People of Hud, and Their Punishment</h2> Allah tells us how the people of Hud responded to him after he had warned them, encouraged them, and clearly explained the truth to them. ﴾قَالُواْ سَوَآءٌ عَلَيْنَآ أَوَعَظْتَ أَمْ لَمْ تَكُنْ مِّنَ الْوَعِظِينَ ﴿ (They said: \"It is the same to us whether you preach or be not of those who preach.\") meaning, `we will not give up our ways.' ﴾وَمَا نَحْنُ بِتَارِكِى ءالِهَتِنَا عَن قَوْلِكَ وَمَا نَحْنُ لَكَ بِمُؤْمِنِينَ﴿ (And we shall not leave our gods for your (mere) saying! And we are not believers in you) (11:53). This is how it was, as Allah says: ﴾إِنَّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ سَوَآءٌ عَلَيْهِمْ ءَأَنذَرْتَهُمْ أَمْ لَمْ تُنذِرْهُمْ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ ﴿ (Verily, those who disbelieve, it is the same to them whether you warn them or do not warn them, they will not believe) (2:6). ﴾إِنَّ الَّذِينَ حَقَّتْ عَلَيْهِمْ كَلِمَةُ رَبِّكَ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ ﴿ (Truly, those, against whom the Word of your Lord has been justified, will not believe) (10:96-97). And they said: ﴾إِنْ هَـذَا إِلاَّ خُلُقُ الاٌّوَّلِينَ ﴿ (This is no other than Khuluq of the ancients.) Some scholars read this: \"Khalq\". According to Ibn Mas`ud and according to `Abdullah bin `Abbas -- as reported from Al-`Awfi -- and `Alqamah and Mujahid, they meant, \"What you have brought to us is nothing but the tales (Akhlaq) of the ancients.\" This is like what the idolators of Quraysh said: ﴾وَقَالُواْ أَسَـطِيرُ الاٌّوَّلِينَ اكْتَتَبَهَا فَهِىَ تُمْلَى عَلَيْهِ بُكْرَةً وَأَصِيلاً ﴿ (And they say: \"Tales of the ancients, which he has written down, and they are dictated to him morning and afternoon.\") (25:5) And Allah said: ﴾وَقَالَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ إِنْ هَـذَا إِلاَّ إِفْكٌ افْتَرَاهُ وَأَعَانَهُ عَلَيْهِ قَوْمٌ ءَاخَرُونَ فَقَدْ جَآءُوا ظُلْماً وَزُوراً وَقَالُواْ أَسَـطِيرُ الاٌّوَّلِينَ﴿ (Those who disbelieve say: \"This is nothing but a lie that he has invented, and others have helped him in it. In fact, they have produced an injustice and a lie.\" And they say: \"Tales of the ancients...\") (25:4-5) ﴾وَإِذَا قِيلَ لَهُمْ مَّاذَآ أَنزَلَ رَبُّكُمْ قَالُواْ أَسَـطِيرُ الاٌّوَّلِينَ ﴿ (And when it is said to them: \"What is it that your Lord has sent down\" They say: \"Tales of the ancient!\") (16:24). Some other scholars recited it, ﴾إِنْ هَـذَا إِلاَّ خُلُقُ الاٌّوَّلِينَ ﴿ (This is no other than Khuluq of the ancients,) \"as Khuluq,\" meaning their religion. What they were following was the religion of the ancients, their fathers and grandfathers, as if they were saying: \"We are following them, we will live as they lived and die as they died, and there will be no resurrection and no judgement.\" Hence they said: ﴾وَمَا نَحْنُ بِمُعَذَّبِينَ ﴿ (And we are not going to be punished.) Allah's saying; ﴾فَكَذَّبُوهُ فَأَهْلَكْنَـهُمْ﴿ (So they denied him, and We destroyed them.) meaning, they continued to disbelieve and stubbornly oppose Allah's Prophet Hud, so Allah destroyed them. The means of their destruction has been described in more than one place in the Qur'an: Allah sent against them a strong and furious wind, i.e., a fiercely blowing wind that was intensely cold. Thus the means of their destruction was suited to their nature, for they were the strongest and fiercest of people, so Allah overpowered them with something that was even stronger and fiercer than them, as Allah says: ﴾أَلَمْ تَرَ كَيْفَ فَعَلَ رَبُّكَ بِعَادٍ - إِرَمَ ذَاتِ الْعِمَادِ ﴿ (Have you not seen how your Lord dealt with `Ad of Iram Possesors of the pillars) (89:6-7). This refers to the former `Ad, as Allah says: ﴾وَأَنَّهُ أَهْلَكَ عَاداً الاٍّولَى ﴿ (And that it is He Who destroyed the former `Ad) (53:50). They were descendents of Iram bin Sam bin Nuh, ﴾ذَاتِ الْعِمَادِ﴿ (Possesors of the pillars) They used to live among pillars. Those who claim that Iram was a city take this idea from Isra'iliyyat narrations, from the words of Ka`b and Wahb, but there is no real basis for that. Allah says: ﴾الَّتِى لَمْ يُخْلَقْ مِثْلُهَا فِى الْبِلَـدِ ﴿ (The like of which were not created in the land) (89:8). meaning, nothing like this tribe was created in terms of might, power and tyranny. If what was meant was a city, it would have said, \"The like of which was not built in the land.\" And Allah says: ﴾فَأَمَّا عَادٌ فَاسْتَكْبَرُواْ فِى الاٌّرْضِ بِغَيْرِ الْحَقِّ وَقَالُواْ مَنْ أَشَدُّ مِنَّا قُوَّةً أَوَلَمْ يَرَوْاْ أَنَّ اللَّهَ الَّذِى خَلَقَهُمْ هُوَ أَشَدُّ مِنْهُمْ قُوَّةً وَكَانُواْ بِـَايَـتِنَا يَجْحَدُونَ ﴿ (As for `Ad, they were arrogant in the land without right, and they said: \"Who is mightier than us in strength\" See they not that Allah Who created them was mightier in strength than them. And they used to deny Our Ayat!) (41:15) And Allah says: ﴾وَأَمَّا عَادٌ فَأُهْلِكُواْ بِرِيحٍ صَرْصَرٍ عَاتِيَةٍ ﴿ (And as for `Ad, they were destroyed by a furious violent wind!) until His saying: ﴾حُسُوماً﴿ (in succession) (69:6-7) meaning, consecutively (i.e., seven nights and eight days). ﴾فَتَرَى الْقَوْمَ فِيهَا صَرْعَى كَأَنَّهُمْ أَعْجَازُ نَخْلٍ خَاوِيَةٍ﴿ (so that you could see men lying overthrown (destroyed), as if they were hollow trunks of date palms!) (69:7) means, they were left as headless bodies, because the wind would come and carry one of them, then drop him on his head, so that his brains were spilled out, his head was broken and he was thrown aside, as if they were uprooted stems of date-palms. They used to build fortresses in the mountains and caves, and they dug ditches half as deep as a man is tall, but that did not help them against the command of Allah at all. ﴾إِنَّ أَجَلَ اللَّهِ إِذَا جَآءَ لاَ يُؤَخَّرُ﴿ (Verily, the term given by Allah, when it comes, cannot be delayed) (71:4). Allah says here: ﴾فَكَذَّبُوهُ فَأَهْلَكْنَـهُمْ﴿ (So they denied him, and We destroyed them.) "

  26,145,"<h2>Salih and the People of Thamud</h2> Here Allah tells us about His servant and Messenger Salih, whom He sent to his people Thamud. They were Arabs living in the city of Al-Hijr -- which is between Wadi Al-Qura and Greater Syria. Their location is well known. In our explanation of Surat Al-A`raf, we mentioned the Hadiths which tell how the Messenger of Allah ﷺ passed by their dwelling place when he wanted to launch a raid on Syria. He went as far as Tabuk, then he went back to Al-Madinah to prepare himself for the campaign. Thamud came after `Ad and before Ibrahim, peace be upon him. Their Prophet Salih called them to Allah, to worship Him alone with no partner or associate, and to obey whatever commands were conveyed to them, but they refused, rejecting him and opposing him. He told them that he did not seek any reward from them for his call to them, but that he would seek the reward for that with Allah. Then he reminded them of the blessings of Allah. "

  26,152,"<h2>A Reminder to Them of their Circumstances and the Blessings</h2> They enjoyed Salih preached to them, warning them that the punishment of Allah could overtake them and reminding them of the blessings that Allah had bestowed upon them, by giving them ample provision and making them safe from all kinds of dangers, giving them gardens and flowing springs, and bringing forth for them crops and fruits. ﴾وَنَخْلٍ طَلْعُهَا هَضِيمٌ﴿ (and date palms with soft clusters.) Al-`Awfi narrated from Ibn `Abbas, \"Ripe and rich.\" `Ali bin Abi Talhah narrated from Ibn `Abbas that this meant growing luxuriantly. Isma`il bin Abi Khalid narrated from `Amr bin Abi `Amr -- who met the Companions -- from Ibn `Abbas that this means, \"When it becomes ripe and soft.\" This was narrated by Ibn Abi Hatim, then he said: \"And something similar was narrated from Abu Salih.\" ﴾وَتَنْحِتُونَ مِنَ الْجِبَالِ بُيُوتاً فَـرِهِينَ ﴿ (And you hew out in the mountains, houses with great skill.) Ibn `Abbas and others said, \"With great skill.\" According to another report from him: \"They were greedy and extravagant.\" This was the view of Mujahid and another group. There is no contradiction between the two views, because they built the houses which they carved in the mountains as a form of extravagant play, with no need for them as dwelling places. They were highly skilled in the arts of masonry and stone-carving, as is well known to anyone who has seen their structures. So, Salih said to them: ﴾فَاتَّقُواْ اللَّهَ وَأَطِيعُونِ ﴿ (So, have Taqwa of Allah, and obey me.) Pay attention to that which could benefit you in this world and the Hereafter; worshipping your Lord Who created you, who granted you provisions so that you could worship Him alone and glorify Him morning and evening. ﴾وَلاَ تُطِيعُواْ أَمْرَ الْمُسْرِفِينَ - الَّذِينَ يُفْسِدُونَ فِى الاٌّرْضِ وَلاَ يُصْلِحُونَ ﴿ (And follow not the command of the extravagant, who make mischief in the land, and reform not.) meaning, their chiefs and leaders, who called them to Shirk, disbelief and opposition to the truth. ﴾قَالُواْ إِنَّمَآ أَنتَ مِنَ الْمُسَحَّرِينَ - مَآ أَنتَ إِلاَّ بَشَرٌ مِّثْلُنَا فَأْتِ بِـَايَةٍ إِن كُنتَ مِنَ الصَّـدِقِينَ - قَالَ هَـذِهِ نَاقَةٌ لَّهَا شِرْبٌ وَلَكُمْ شِرْبُ يَوْمٍ مَّعْلُومٍ - وَلاَ تَمَسُّوهَا بِسُوءٍ فَيَأْخُذَكُمْ عَذَابُ يَوْمٍ عَظِيمٍ - فَعَقَرُوهَا فَأَصْبَحُواْ نَـدِمِينَ - فَأَخَذَهُمُ الْعَذَابُ إِنَّ فِى ذَلِكَ لأَيَةً وَمَا كَانَ أَكْثَرُهُم مُّؤْمِنِينَ ﴿"

  26,159,"<h2>The Response of Thamud, Their Demand for a Sign, and Their Punishment</h2> Allah tells us how Thamud responded to their Prophet Salih, upon him be peace, when he called them to worship their Lord, may He be glorified. ﴾قَالُواْ إِنَّمَآ أَنتَ مِنَ الْمُسَحَّرِينَ ﴿ (They said: \"You are only of those bewitched!\") Mujahid said, \"They meant he was one affected by witchcraft.\" Then they said: ﴾مَآ أَنتَ إِلاَّ بَشَرٌ مِّثْلُنَا﴿ (You are but a human being like us.) meaning, `how can you receive Revelation when we do not' This is like the Ayah where they are described as saying: ﴾أَءُلْقِىَ الذِّكْرُ عَلَيْهِ مِن بَيْنِنَا بَلْ هُوَ كَذَّابٌ أَشِرٌ - سَيَعْلَمُونَ غَداً مَّنِ الْكَذَّابُ الاٌّشِرُ ﴿ (\"Is it that the Reminder is sent to him alone from among us Nay, he is an insolent liar!\" Tomorrow they will come to know who is the liar, the insolent one!) (54:26-27) Then they asked him for a sign to prove that what he brought to them from their Lord was the truth. A crowd of them gathered and demanded that he immediately bring forth from the rock a she-camel that was ten months pregnant, and they pointed to a certain rock in their midst. Allah's Prophet Salih made them promise that if he responded to their request, they would believe in him and follow him. So they agreed to that. The Prophet of Allah Salih, peace be upon him, stood and prayed, then he prayed to Allah to grant them their request. Then the rock to which they had pointed split open, revealing a she-camel that was ten months pregnant, excactly as they had requested. So some of them believed, but most of them disbelieved. ﴾قَالَ هَـذِهِ نَاقَةٌ لَّهَا شِرْبٌ وَلَكُمْ شِرْبُ يَوْمٍ مَّعْلُومٍ ﴿ (He said: \"Here is a she-camel: it has a right to drink (water), and you have a right to drink (water) (each) on a day, known.) meaning, `she will drink from your water one day, and on the next day you will drink from it.' ﴾وَلاَ تَمَسُّوهَا بِسُوءٍ فَيَأْخُذَكُمْ عَذَابُ يَوْمٍ عَظِيمٍ ﴿ (And touch her not with harm, lest the torment of a Great Day should seize you.) He warned them of the punishment of Allah if they should do her any harm. The she-camel stayed among them for a while, drinking the water, eating leaves and grazing, and they benefitted from her milk which they took in sufficient quantities for every one to drink his fill. After this had gone on for a long time, and the time for their destruction drew near, they conspired to kill her: ﴾فَعَقَرُوهَا فَأَصْبَحُواْ نَـدِمِينَ فَأَخَذَهُمُ الْعَذَابُ﴿ (But they killed her, and then they became regretful. So, the torment overtook them.) Their land was shaken by a strong earthquake, and there came to them an overwhelming Sayhah (shout) which took their hearts from their places. They were overtaken by events which they were not expecting, so they were left (dead), lying prostrate in their homes. ﴾إِنَّ فِى ذَلِكَ لأَيَةً وَمَا كَانَ أَكْثَرُهُم مُّؤْمِنِينَ ﴿﴾وَإِنَّ رَبَّكَ لَهُوَ الْعَزِيزُ الرَّحِيمُ ﴿ (Verily, in this is indeed a sign, yet most of them are not believers. And verily your Lord, He is indeed the All-Mighty, the Most Merciful.) "
