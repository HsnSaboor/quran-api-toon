tafsir[11]{c,v,t}:
  18,5,"<h2>Which was revealed in Makkah</h2><h2>What has been mentioned about the Virtues of this Surah and the first and last ten Ayat</h2> Imam Ahmad recorded that Al-Bara' said: \"A man recited Al-Kahf and there was an animal in the house which began acting in a nervous manner. He looked, and saw a fog or cloud overhead. He mentioned this to the Prophet , who said:  «اقْرَأْ فُلَانُ، فَإِنَّهَا السَّكِينَةُ تَنْزِلُ عِنْدَ الْقُرْآنِ أَوْ تَنَزَّلَتْ لِلْقُرْآن»  (Keep on reciting so and so, for this is the tranquillity which descends when one reads Qur'an or because of reading Qur'an;) This was also recorded in the Two Sahihs. This man who recited it was Usayd bin Al-Hudayr, as we have previously mentioned in our Tafsir of Surat Al-Baqarah. Imam Ahmad recorded from Abu Ad-Darda' that the Prophet said:  «مَنْ حَفِظَ عَشْرَ آيَاتٍ مِنْ أَوَّلِ سُورَةِ الْكَهْفِ عُصِمَ مِنَ الدَّجَّال»  (Whoever memorizes ten Ayat from the beginning of Surat Al-Kahf will be protected from the Dajjal.) This was also recorded by Muslim, Abu Dawud, An-Nasa'i and At-Tirmidhi. According to the version recorded by At-Tirmidhi,  «مَنْ حَفِظَ ثَلَاثَ آيَاتٍ مِنْ أَوَّلِ الْكَهْف»  (Whoever memorizes three Ayat from the beginning of Al-Kahf.) He said, it is \"Hasan Sahih. \" In his Mustadrak, Al-Hakim recorded from Abu Sa`id that the Prophet said:  «مَنْ قَرَأَ سُورَةَ الْكَهْفِ فِي يَوْمِ الْجُمُعَةِ أَضَاءَ لَهُ مِنَ النُّورِ مَا بَيْنَهُ وَبَيْنَ الْجُمُعَتَيْن»  (Whoever recites Surat Al-Kahf on Friday, it will illuminate him with light from one Friday to the next.) Then he said: \"This Hadith has a Sahih chain, but they (Al-Bukhari and Muslim) did not record it.\" Al-Hafiz Abu Bakr Al-Bayhaqi also recorded it in his Sunan from Al-Hakim, then he narrated with his own chain that the Prophet said:  «مَنْ قَرَأَ سُورَةَ الْكَهْفِ كَمَا نَزَلَتْ، كَانَتْ لَهُ نُورًا يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَة»  (Whoever recites Surat Al-Kahf as it was revealed, it will be a light for him on the Day of Resurrection.)  بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ  In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. <h2>The Revelation of the Qur'an brings both Good News and a Warning</h2> In the beginning of this Tafsir, we mentioned that Allah, praises His Holy Self at the beginning and end of matters, for He is the One to be praised in all circumstances, all praise and thanks be to Him, in the beginning and in the end. He praises Himself for revealing His Mighty Book to His Noble Messenger Muhammad ﷺ, which is the greatest blessing that Allah has granted the people of this earth. Through the Qur'an, He brings them out of the darkness into light. He has made it a Book that is straight, neither distorted nor confusion therein. It clearly guides to a straight path, plain and manifest, giving a warning to the disbelievers and good news to the believers. This is why Allah says:  وَلَمْ يَجْعَل لَّهُ عِوَجَا  (and has not placed therein any crookedness.) meaning, there is nothing twisted or confusing about it. But He has made it balanced and straightforward as He said;  قَيِّماً  ((He has made it) straight), meaning straightforward,  لِّيُنْذِرَ بَأْسًا شَدِيدًا مِّن لَّدُنْهُ  (to give warning of a severe punishment from Him,) meaning, to those who oppose His Prophet and disbelieve in His Book, He issues a warning of severe punishment hastened in this world and postponed to the world Hereafter.  مِن لَّدُنْهُ  (from Him) means, from Allah. For none can punish as He punishes and none is stronger or more reliable than Him.  وَيُبَشِّرُ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ  (and to give good news to the believers,) means, those who believe in this Qur'an and confirm their faith by righteous actions.  أَنَّ لَهُمْ أَجْرًا حَسَنًا  (that they shall have a fair reward.) means, a beautiful reward from Allah.  مَّاكِثِينَ فِيهِ  (They shall abide therein) means, in what Allah rewards them with, and that is Paradise, where they will live forever.  أَبَدًا  (forever.) means, for always, never ending or ceasing to be.  وَيُنْذِرَ الَّذِينَ قَالُواْ اتَّخَذَ اللَّهُ وَلَدًا  (And to warn those who say, \"Allah has begotten a child.\") Ibn Ishaq said: \"These are the pagan Arabs, who said, `We worship the angels who are the daughters of Allah.\"'  مَا لَهُمْ بِهِ مِنْ عِلْمٍ  (No knowledge have they of such a thing, ) meaning, this thing that they have fabricated and made up.  وَلاَ لاَبَآئِهِمْ  (nor had their fathers.) meaning, their predecessors.  كَبُرَتْ كَلِمَةً  (Mighty is the word) This highlights the seriousness and enormity of the lie they have made up. Allah says:  كَبُرَتْ كَلِمَةً تَخْرُجُ مِنْ أَفْوَاهِهِمْ  (Mighty is the word that comes out of their mouths.) meaning, it has no basis apart from what they say, and they have no evidence for it apart from their own lies and fabrications. Hence Allah says:  إِن يَقُولُونَ إِلاَّ كَذِبًا  (They utter nothing but a lie.) <h2>Reason why this Surah was revealed</h2> Muhammad bin Ishaq mentioned the reason why this Surah was revealed. He said that an old man from among the people of Egypt who came to them some forty-odd years ago told him, from `Ikrimah that Ibn `Abbas said: \"The Quraysh sent An-Nadr bin Al-Harith and `Uqbah bin Abi Mu`it to the Jewish rabbis in Al-Madinah, and told them: `Ask them (the rabbis) about Muhammad, and describe him to them, and tell them what he is saying. They are the people of the first Book, and they have more knowledge of the Prophets than we do.' So they set out and when they reached Al-Madinah, they asked the Jewish rabbis about the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. They described him to them and told them some of what he had said. They said, `You are the people of the Tawrah and we have come to you so that you can tell us about this companion of ours.' They (the rabbis) said, `Ask him about three things which we will tell you to ask, and if he answers them then he is a Prophet who has been sent (by Allah); if he does not, then he is saying things that are not true, in which case how you will deal with him will be up to you. Ask him about some young men in ancient times, what was their story For theirs is a strange and wondrous tale. Ask him about a man who travelled a great deal and reached the east and the west of the earth. What was his story And ask him about the Ruh (soul or spirit) -- what is it If he tells you about these things, then he is a Prophet, so follow him, but if he does not tell you, then he is a man who is making things up, so deal with him as you see fit.' So An-Nadr and `Uqbah left and came back to the Quraysh, and said: `O people of Quraysh, we have come to you with a decisive solution which will put an end to the problem between you and Muhammad. The Jewish rabbis told us to ask him about some matters,' and they told the Quraysh what they were. Then they came to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and said, `O Muhammad, tell us,' and they asked him about the things they had been told to ask. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,  «أُخْبِرُكُمْ غَدًا عَمَّا سَأَلْتُمْ عَنْه»  (I will tell you tomorrow about what you have asked me.) but he did not say `If Allah wills.' So they went away, and the Messenger of Allah ﷺ stayed for fifteen days without any revelation from Allah concerning that, and Jibril, peace be upon him, did not come to him either. The people of Makkah started to doubt him, and said, `Muhammad promised to tell us the next day, and now fifteen days have gone by and he has not told us anything in response to the questions we asked.' The Messenger of Allah ﷺ felt sad because of the delay in revelation, and was grieved by what the people of Makkah were saying about him. Then Jibril came to him from Allah with the Surah about the companions of Al-Kahf, which also contained a rebuke for feeling sad about the idolators. The Surah also told him about the things they had asked him about, the young men and the traveler. The question about the Ruh was answered in the Ayah;  وَيَسْـَلُونَكَ عَنِ الرُّوحِ قُلِ الرُّوحُ  (And they ask you concerning the Ruh (the spirit); say: \"The Ruh...\") 17:85. "

  18,8,"<h2>Do not feel sorry because the Idolators do not believe Allah consoles His Messenger for his sorrow</h2> فَلاَ تَذْهَبْ نَفْسُكَ عَلَيْهِمْ حَسَرَتٍ  (So destroy not yourself in sorrow for them.) 35:8  وَلاَ تَحْزَنْ عَلَيْهِمْ  (And grieve not over them.) 16:127  لَعَلَّكَ بَـخِعٌ نَّفْسَكَ أَلاَّ يَكُونُواْ مُؤْمِنِينَ  (It may be that you are going to kill yourself with grief, that they do not become believers.) 26:3 meaning, maybe you will destroy yourself with your grief over them. Allah says:  فَلَعَلَّكَ بَـخِعٌ نَّفْسَكَ عَلَى ءَاثَـرِهِمْ إِن لَّمْ يُؤْمِنُواْ بِهَـذَا الْحَدِيثِ  (Perhaps, you would kill yourself in grief, over their footsteps, because they believe not in this narration.) meaning the Qur'an.  أَسَفاً  (in grief) Allah is saying, `do not destroy yourself with regret.' Qatadah said: \"killing yourself with anger and grief over them.\" Mujahid said: \"with anxiety.\" These are synonymous, so the meaning is: `Do not feel sorry for them, just convey the Message of Allah to them. Whoever goes the right way, then he goes the right way only for the benefit of himself. And whoever goes astray, then he strays at his own loss, so do not destroy yourself in sorrow for them.' <h2>This World is the Place of Trial Then Allah tells us that He has made this world a temporary abode, adorned with transient beauty, andHe made it a place of trial, not a place of settlement. So He says</h2> إِنَّا جَعَلْنَا مَا عَلَى الاٌّرْضِ زِينَةً لَّهَا لِنَبْلُوَهُمْ أَيُّهُم أَحْسَنُ عَمَلاً  (Verily, we have made that which is on earth an adornment for it, in order that We may test which of them are best in deeds.) Abu Maslamah narrated from Abu Nadrah from Abu Sa`id that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:  «إِنَّ الدُّنْيَا حُلْوَةٌ خَضِرَةٌ، وَإِنَّ اللهَ مُسْتَخْلِفُكُمْ فِيهَا فَنَاظِرٌ مَاذَا تَعْمَلُونَ، فَاتَّقُوا الدُّنْيَا، وَاتَّقُوا النِّسَاءَ، فَإِنَّ أَوَّلَ فِتْنَةِ بَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ كَانَتْ فِي النِّسَاء»  (This world is sweet and green, and Allah makes you generations succeeding one another, so He is watching what you will do. Beware of (the beguilements of) this world and beware of women, for the first affliction that Children of Israel suffered from was that of women.) Then Allah tells us that this world will pass away and come to an end, as He says:  وَإِنَّا لَجَاعِلُونَ مَا عَلَيْهَا صَعِيداً جُرُزاً  (And verily, We shall make all that is on it bare, dry soil.) means, `after having adorned it, We will destroy it and make everything on it bare and dry, with no vegetation or any other benefit.' Al-`Awfi reported from Ibn `Abbas that this means everything on it would be wiped out and destroyed. Mujahid said: \"a dry and barren plain.\" Qatadah said, \"A plain on which there are no trees or vegetation.\" "

  18,12,"<h2>The Story of the People of Al-Kahf Here Allah tells us about the story of the people of Al-Kahf in brief and general terms, then Heexplains it in more detail. He says</h2>﴾أَمْ حَسِبْتَ﴿ (Do you think) -- O Muhammad -- ﴾أَنَّ أَصْحَـبَ الْكَهْفِ وَالرَّقِيمِ كَانُواْ مِنْ ءَايَـتِنَا عَجَبًا﴿ (that the people of Al-Kahf and Ar-Raqim were a wonder among Our signs) meaning, their case was not something amazing compared to Our power and ability, for the creation of the heavens and earth, the alternation of night and day and the subjugation of the sun, moon and heavenly bodies, and other mighty signs indicate the great power of Allah and show that He is able to do whatever He wills. He is not incapable of doing more amazing things than the story of the people of the Cave. Similarly, Ibn Jurayj reported Mujahid saying about, ﴾أَمْ حَسِبْتَ أَنَّ أَصْحَـبَ الْكَهْفِ وَالرَّقِيمِ كَانُواْ مِنْ ءَايَـتِنَا عَجَبًا ﴿ (Do you think that the people of Al-Kahf and Ar-Raqim were a wonder among Our signs) \"Among Our signs are things that are more amazing than this.\" Al-`Awfi reported that Ibn `Abbas said: ﴾أَمْ حَسِبْتَ أَنَّ أَصْحَـبَ الْكَهْفِ وَالرَّقِيمِ كَانُواْ مِنْ ءَايَـتِنَا عَجَبًا ﴿ (Do you think that the people of Al-Kahf and Ar-Raqim were a wonder among Our signs) \"What I have given to you of knowledge, the Sunnah and the Book is far better than the story of the people of Al-Kahf and Ar-Raqim.\" Muhammad bin Ishaq said: \"(It means) I have not shown My creatures a proof more amazing than the story of the people of the Al-Kahf and Ar-Raqim.\" iAl-Kahf refers to a cave in a mountain, which is where the young men sought refuge. With regard to the word Ar-Raqim, Al-`Awfi reported from Ibn `Abbas that it is a valley near Aylah. This was also said in another narration by `Atiyah Al-`Awfi and Qatadah. Ad-Dahhak said: \"As for Al-Kahf, it is a cave in the valley, and Ar-Raqim is the name of the valley.\" Mujahid said, \"Ar-Raqim refers to their buildings.\" Others said it refers to the valley in which their cave was. `Abdur-Razzaq recorded that Ibn `Abbas said about Ar-Raqim: \"Ka`b used to say that it was the town.\" Ibn Jurayj reported that Ibn `Abbas said, \"Ar-Raqim is the mountain in which the cave was.\" Sa`id bin Jubayr said, \"Ar-Raqim is a tablet of stone on which they wrote the story of the people of the Cave, then they placed it at the entrance to the Cave.\" ﴾إِذْ أَوَى الْفِتْيَةُ إِلَى الْكَهْفِ فَقَالُواْ رَبَّنَآ ءَاتِنَا مِن لَّدُنكَ رَحْمَةً وَهَيِّىءْ لَنَا مِنْ أَمْرِنَا رَشَدًا ﴿ ((Remember) when the young men fled for refuge to Al-Kahf. They said: \"Our Lord! Bestow on us mercy from Yourself, and facilitate for us our affair in the right way!\") Here Allah tells us about those young men who fled from their people for the sake of their religion, fearing persecution. So they fled taking refuge in the cave of a mountain, where they hid from their people. When they entered the cave, they asked Allah to show mercy and kindness towards them, ﴾رَبَّنَآ ءَاتِنَا مِن لَّدُنكَ رَحْمَةً﴿ (Our Lord! Bestow on us mercy from Yourself,) meaning, `give us Your mercy and conceal us from our people.' ﴾وَهَيِّىءْ لَنَا مِنْ أَمْرِنَا رَشَدًا﴿ (and facilitate for us our affair in the right way.) means, direct our matter well, i.e., grant us a good end. As was reported in the Hadith: ﴾«وَمَا قَضَيْتَ لَنَا مِنْ قَضَاءٍ فَاجْعَلْ عَاقِبَتَهُ رَشَدًا»﴿ (Whatever You have decreed for us, make its consequences good). ﴾فَضَرَبْنَا عَلَى ءَاذَانِهِمْ فِى الْكَهْفِ سِنِينَ عَدَدًا ﴿ (Therefore, We covered up their hearing in the cave for a number of years.) meaning, `We caused them to sleep when they entered the cave, and they slept for many years.' ﴾ثُمَّ بَعَثْنَـهُمْ﴿ (Then We raised them up) from that slumber, and one of them went out with his Dirhams (silver coins) to buy them some food, as it will be discussed in more detail below. Allah says: ﴾ثُمَّ بَعَثْنَـهُمْ لِنَعْلَمَ أَيُّ الحِزْبَيْنِ﴿ (Then We raised them up, that We might test which of the two parties) meaning, the two parties who disputed about them, ﴾أَحْصَى لِمَا لَبِثُواْ أَمَدًا﴿ (was best at calculating the time period that they tarried.) It was said that this refers to how long they stayed in the cave. "
