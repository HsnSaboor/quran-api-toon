  10,64,"<h2>Identifying the Awliya' of Allah</h2> Allah tells us that His Awliya' (friends and allies) are those who believe and have Taqwa of Allah as He defined them. Every pious, God-fearing person is a friend of Allah, therefore,  لاَ خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ  (no fear shall come upon them) from the future horrors they will face in the Hereafter.  وَلاَ هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ  (nor shall they grieve.) over anything left behind in this world. Ibn Jarir recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that Allah's Messenger ﷺ said:  «إِنَّ مِنْ عِبَادِ اللهِ عِبَادًا يَغْبِطُهُمُ الْأَنْبِيَاءُ وَالشُّهَدَاء»  (Among the servants of Allah there will be those whom the Prophets and the martyrs will consider fortunate). It was said: \"Who are these, O Messenger of Allah, so we may love them\" He said:  «هُمْ قَوْمٌ تَحَابُّوا فِي اللهِ مِنْ غَيْرِ أَمْوَالٍ وَلَا أَنْسَابٍ، وُجُوهُهُمْ نُورٌ عَلَى مَنَابِرَ مِنْ نُورٍ، لَا يَخَافُون إِذَا خَافَ النَّاسُ، وَلَا يَحْزَنُونَ إِذَا حَزِنَ النَّاس»  (These are people who loved one another for the sake of Allah without any other interest like money or kinship. Their faces will be light, upon platforms of light. They shall have no fear (on that Day) when fear shall come upon people. Nor shall they grieve when others grieve.) Then he recited:  أَلا إِنَّ أَوْلِيَآءَ اللَّهِ لاَ خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلاَ هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ  (Behold!! Verily, the Awliya' (friends and allies) of Allah, no fear shall come upon them nor shall they grieve.) <h2>The True Dream is a Form of Good News</h2> Ibn Jarir narrated from `Ubadah bin As-Samit that he recited to Allah's Messenger ﷺ:  لَهُمُ الْبُشْرَى فِي الْحَيوةِ الدُّنْيَا وَفِى الاٌّخِرَةِ  (For them is good news, in the life of the present world, and in the Hereafter.) and said, \"We know the good news of the Hereafter, it is Paradise. But what is the good news in this world\" He said:  «الرُّؤْيَا الصَّالِحَةُ يَرَاهَا الْعَبْدُ أَوْ تُرَى لَهُ. وَهِيَ جُزْءٌ مِنْ أَرْبَعَةٍ وَأَرْبَعِينَ جُزْءًا أَوْ سَبْعِينَ جُزْءًا مِنَ النُّبُوَّة»  (It is the good dream that a servant may see or it is seen about him. This dream is one part from forty-four or seventy parts of Prophethood.) Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Dharr said, \"O Messenger of Allah! What about a man who does deeds that the people commend him for\" Allah's Messenger ﷺ said,  «تِلْكَ عَاجِلُ بُشْرَى الْمُؤْمِن»  (That is the good news that has been expedited for the believer.) Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin `Amr said that Allah's Messenger ﷺ said:  لَهُمُ الْبُشْرَى فِي الْحَيوةِ الدُّنْيَا وَفِى الاٌّخِرَةِ  (For them is good news, in the life of the present world) Then he said,  «الرُّؤْيَا الصَّالِحَةُ يُبَشَّرُهَا الْمُؤْمِنُ، جُزْءٌ مِنْ تِسْعَةٍ وَأَرْبَعِينَ جُزْءًا مِنَ النُّبُوَّةِ، فَمَنْ رَأَى ذَلِكَ فَلْيُخْبِرْ بِهَا،وَمَنْ رَأَى سِوَى ذَلِكَ فَإِنَّمَا هُوَ مِنَ الشَّيْطَانِ لِيُحْزِنَهُ، فَلْيَنْفُثْ عَنْ يَسَارِهِ ثَلَاثًا، وَلْيُكَبِّرْ، وَلَا يُخْبِرْ بِهَا أَحَدًا»  (The good dream that comes as a good news for the believer is a part of forty-nine parts of prophethood. So if anyone of you has a good dream, he should narrate it to others. But if he has a dream that he dislikes, then it is from Shaytan to make him sad. He should blow to his left three times, and say : \"Allahu Akbar,\" and should not mention it to anyone.\") And it was also said, \"The good news here is the glad tidings the angels bring to the believer at the time of death. They bring him the good news of Paradise and forgiveness.\" Similarly, Allah said:  إِنَّ الَّذِينَ قَالُواْ رَبُّنَا اللَّهُ ثُمَّ اسْتَقَـمُواْ تَتَنَزَّلُ عَلَيْهِمُ الْمَلَـئِكَةُ أَلاَّ تَخَافُواْ وَلاَ تَحْزَنُواْ وَأَبْشِرُواْ بِالْجَنَّةِ الَّتِى كُنتُمْ تُوعَدُونَ - نَحْنُ أَوْلِيَآؤُكُمْ فِى الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا وَفِى الاٌّخِرَةِ وَلَكُمْ فِيهَا مَا تَشْتَهِى أَنفُسُكُمْ وَلَكُمْ فِيهَا مَا تَدَّعُونَ - نُزُلاً مِّنْ غَفُورٍ رَّحِيمٍ  (Verily, those who say: \"Our Lord is Allah (alone),\" and then they stand straight and firm, on them the angels will descend (at the time of their death) (saying): \"Fear not, nor grieve! But receive the glad tidings of Paradise which you have been promised! We have been your friends in the life of this world and are (so) in the Hereafter. Therein you shall have (all) that your souls desire, and therein you shall have (all) for which you ask. An entertainment from (Allah), the Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.\") (41:30-32) In the Hadith narrated by Al-Bara', the Prophet said:  إِنَّ الْمُؤْمِنَ إِذَا حَضَرَهُ الْمُوتُ جَاءَهُ مَلَائِكَةٌ بِيضُ الْوُجُوهِ بِيضُ الثِّيَابِ فَقَالُوا:اخْرُجِي أَيَّتُهَا الرُّوحُ الطَّيِّبَةُ إِلَى رُوْحٍ وَرَيْحَانٍ وَرَبَ غَيْرِ غَضْبَانَ، فَتَخْرُجُ مِنْ فَمِهِ كَمَا تَسِيلُ الْقَطْرَةُ مِنْ فَمِ السِّقَاء»  (When death approaches the believer, angels with white faces and white clothes come to him and say: \"O good soul! Come out to comfort and provision and a Lord who is not angry.\" The soul then comes out of his mouth like a drop of water pouring out of a water skin.) Their good news in the Hereafter is as Allah said:  لاَ يَحْزُنُهُمُ الْفَزَعُ الاٌّكْبَرُ وَتَتَلَقَّـهُمُ الْمَلَـئِكَةُ هَـذَا يَوْمُكُمُ الَّذِى كُنتُمْ تُوعَدُونَ  (The greatest terror (on the Day of Resurrection) will not grieve them, and the angels will meet them, (with the greeting:) \"This is your Day which you were promised.\") (21:103), and,  يَوْمَ تَرَى الْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَالْمُؤْمِنَـتِ يَسْعَى نُورُهُم بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَبِأَيْمَـنِهِم بُشْرَاكُمُ الْيَوْمَ جَنَّـتٌ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهَا الاٌّنْهَـرُ خَـلِدِينَ فِيهَا ذَلِكَ هُوَ الْفَوْزُ الْعَظِيمُ  (On the Day you shall see the believing men and the believing women -- their light running forward before them and by their right hands. Glad tidings for you this Day! Gardens under which rivers flow (Paradise), to dwell therein forever! Truly, this is the great success!)(57:12) Allah then said:  لاَ تَبْدِيلَ لِكَلِمَاتِ اللَّهِ  (No change can there be in the Words of Allah.) meaning, this promise doesn't change or breach or fall short. It is decreed and firm, and going to happen undoubtedly.  ذَلِكَ هُوَ الْفَوْزُ الْعَظِيمُ  (This is indeed the supreme success.) "

  10,67,"<h2>All Might and Honor is for Allah -- He Alone has Full Authority within the Universe</h2> Allah said to His Messenger ,  ﴾وَلاَ يَحْزُنكَ﴿ (Do not greive) because of the remarks of these idolators, and depend on Allah and ask for His help. Put your trust in Him.  ﴾إِنَّ الْعِزَّةَجَمِيعاً﴿ (For all power and honor belong to Allah.) All might and honor belong to Him, His Messenger and the believers.  ﴾هُوَ السَّمِيعُ الْعَلِيمُ﴿ (He is the All-Hearer, the All-Knower.) He hears the utterances of His servants and knows their affairs. Allah then stated that to Him is the dominion of the heavens and earth. But the idolators worship idols, that own nothing and can neither harm nor benefit anyone. They have no evidence to base their worship on them. They only follow their own conjecture, lies, and ultimately - falsehood. Allah then informed us that He is the One Who made the night for His servants to rest therein from weariness and exhaustion.  ﴾وَالنَّهَـارَ مُبْصِـراً﴿ (And the day to make things visible (to you).) bright and clear for them to seek livelihood and to travel to fulfill their needs.  ﴾إِنَّ فِى ذلِكَ لآيَـتٍ لِّقَوْمٍ يَسْمَعُونَ﴿ (Verily, in this are Ayat for a people who listen.) Those who hear these proofs and take a lesson from them. These Ayat can lead them to realize the greatness of their Creator and Sustainer.  "

  10,70,"<h2>Allah is Far Above taking a Wife or having Children</h2> Allah criticizes those who claim that He has,  ﴾وَلَداً سُبْحَـنَهُ هُوَ الْغَنِيُّ﴿ (...begotten a son. Glory is to Him! He is Rich (Free of all needs).) He is Greater than that and above it. He is Self-Sufficient, free of want or need of anything. Everything else is in desperate need of Him,  ﴾لَهُ مَا فِى السَّمَـوَت وَمَا فِى الاٌّرْضِ﴿ (His is all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth.) So how can He have a son from what He has created Everything and everyone belongs to Him and is His servant.  ﴾إِنْ عِندَكُمْ مِّن سُلْطَانٍ بِهَـذَآ﴿ (No warrant have you for this) Meaning, you have no proof for the lies and falsehood that you claim,  ﴾أَتَقُولُونَ عَلَى اللَّهِ مَا لاَ تَعْلَمُونَ﴿ (Do you say against Allah what you know not.) This is a severe threat and a firm warning. Similarly, Allah threatened and said:  ﴾وَقَالُواْ اتَّخَذَ الرَّحْمَـنُ وَلَداً - لَقَدْ جِئْتُمْ شَيْئاً إِدّاً - تَكَادُ السَّمَـوَتُ يَتَفَطَّرْنَ مِنْهُ وَتَنشَقُّ الاٌّرْضُ وَتَخِرُّ الْجِبَالُ هَدّاً - أَن دَعَوْا لِلرَّحْمَـنِ وَلَداً - وَمَا يَنبَغِى لِلرَّحْمَـنِ أَن يَتَّخِذَ وَلَداً - إِن كُلُّ مَن فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ إِلاَّ آتِى الرَّحْمَـنِ عَبْداً - لَّقَدْ أَحْصَـهُمْ وَعَدَّهُمْ عَدّاً - وَكُلُّهُمْ ءَاتِيهِ يَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ فَرْداً ﴿ (And they say: \"The Most Gracious has begotten a son.\" Indeed you have brought forth a terribly evil thing. Whereby the heavens are almost torn, and the earth is split asunder, and the mountains fall in ruins, that they ascribe a son to the Most Gracious. But it is not suitable for the Most Gracious that He should beget a son. There is none in the heavens and the earth but comes unto the Most Gracious as a servant. Verily, He knows each one of them, and has counted them a full counting. And everyone of them will come to Him alone on the Day of Resurrection.) (19:88-95) Then Allah warned the liars that fabricated the claim that He has begotten a son. He warned that they will not succeed, never prospering in this world or in the Hereafter. In this world Allah will lead them, step-by-step, to their ruin. He will give them respite and put up with them for a while. He will allow them to have little enjoyment,  ﴾ثُمَّ نَضْطَرُّهُمْ إِلَى عَذَابٍ غَلِيظٍ﴿ (then in the end We shall oblige them to (enter) a great torment.)(31:24) As Allah said here:  ﴾مَتَـعٌ فِى الدُّنْيَا﴿ ((A brief) enjoyment in this world!) meaning, only a short period,  ﴾ثُمَّ إِلَيْنَا مَرْجِعُهُمْ﴿ (and then unto Us will be their return) on the Day of Resurrection;  ﴾ثُمَّ نُذِيقُهُمُ الْعَذَابَ الشَّدِيدَ بِمَا كَانُواْ يَكْفُرُونَ﴿ (Then We shall make them taste the severest torment because they used to disbelieve. ) meaning, `We shall make them taste the painful punishment because of their Kufr and lies about Allah.'
