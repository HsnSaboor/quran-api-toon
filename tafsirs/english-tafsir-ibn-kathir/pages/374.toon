  26,164,"<h2>Lut and His Call</h2> Here Allah tells us about His servant and Messenger Lut, peace be upon him. He was Lut bin Haran bin Azar, the nephew of Ibrahim Al-Khalil, upon him be peace. Allah sent him to a mighty nation during the lifetime of Ibrahim, peace be upon them both. They lived in Sadum (Sodom) and its environs, where Allah destroyed them and turned the area into a putrid, stinking lake, which is well-known in the land of Al-Ghur the Jordan Valley, bordering the mountains of Jerusalem, between the mountains and the land of Al-Karak and Ash-Shawbak. He called them to Allah, to worship Him alone with no partner or associate, and to obey the Messenger whom Allah sent to them. He forbade from disobeying Allah and committing the sin that they had invented which was unknown on earth before their time; intercourse with males instead of with females. Allah said: ﴾أَتَأْتُونَ الذُّكْرَانَ مِنَ الْعَـلَمِينَ - وَتَذَرُونَ مَا خَلَقَ لَكُمْ رَبُّكُمْ مِّنْ أَزْوَجِكُمْ بَلْ أَنتُمْ قَوْمٌ عَادُونَ - قَالُواْ لَئِن لَّمْ تَنتَهِ يلُوطُ لَتَكُونَنَّ مِنَ الْمُخْرَجِينَ - قَالَ إِنِّى لِعَمَلِكُمْ مِّنَ الْقَـلِينَ ﴿"

  26,175,"<h2>Lut's Denunciation of His People's Deeds, Their Response and Their Punishment</h2> The Prophet of Allah forbade them from committing evil deeds and intercourse with males, and he taught them that they should have intercourse with their wives whom Allah had created for them. Their response was only to say: ﴾لَئِن لَّمْ تَنتَهِ يلُوطُ﴿ (If you cease not, O Lut,) meaning, `if you do not give up what you have brought,' ﴾لَتَكُونَنَّ مِنَ الْمُخْرَجِينَ﴿ (verily, you will be one of those who are driven out!) meaning, `we will expel you from among us.' This is like the Ayah, ﴾فَمَا كَانَ جَوَابَ قَوْمِهِ إِلاَّ أَن قَالُواْ أَخْرِجُواْ ءَالَ لُوطٍ مِّن قَرْيَتِكُمْ إِنَّهمْ أُنَاسٌ يَتَطَهَّرُونَ ﴿ (There was no other answer given by his people except that they said: \"Drive out the family of Lut from your city. Verily, these are men who want to be clean and pure!\") (27:56). When he saw that they would not give up their ways, and that they were persisting in their misguidance, he declared his innocence of them, saying: ﴾إِنِّى لِعَمَلِكُمْ مِّنَ الْقَـلِينَ﴿ (I am, indeed, of those who disapprove with severe anger and fury) `Of those who are outraged, I do not like it and I do not accept it, and I have nothing to do with you. ' Then he prayed to Allah against them and said: ﴾رَبِّ نَّجِنِى وَأَهْلِى مِمَّا يَعْمَلُونَ ﴿ (My Lord! Save me and my family from what they do.) Allah says: ﴾فَنَجَّيْنَـهُ وَأَهْلَهُ أَجْمَعِينَ - إِلاَّ عَجُوزاً فِى الْغَـبِرِينَ ﴿ (So, We saved him and his family, all. Except an old woman among those who remained behind.) This was his wife, who was a bad old woman. She stayed behind and was destroyed with whoever else was left. This is similar to what Allah says about them in Surat Al-A`raf and Surah Hud, and in Surat Al-Hijr, where Allah commanded him to take his family at night, except for his wife, and not to turn around when they heard the Sayhah as it came upon his people. So they patiently obeyed the command of Allah and persevered, and Allah sent upon the people a punishment which struck them all, and rained upon them stones of baked clay, piled up. Allah says: ﴾ثُمَّ دَمَّرْنَا الاٌّخَرِينَ وَأَمْطَرْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ مَّطَرًا﴿ (Then afterward We destroyed the others. And We rained on them a rain) until Allah's saying; ﴾وَإِنَّ رَبَّكَ لَهُوَ الْعَزِيزُ الرَّحِيمُ ﴿ (And verily, your Lord, He is indeed the All-Mighty, the Most Merciful. ) ﴾كَذَّبَ أَصْحَـبُ لْـَيْكَةِ الْمُرْسَلِينَ - إِذْ قَالَ لَهُمْ شُعَيْبٌ أَلاَ تَتَّقُونَ إِنِّى لَكُمْ رَسُولٌ أَمِينٌ ﴿"

  26,180,"<h2>Shu`ayb and His Preaching to the Dwellers of Al-Aykah</h2> The companions of Al-Aykah were the people of Madyan, according to the most correct view. The Prophet of Allah Shu`ayb was one of them, but it does not say here, their brother Shu`ayb, because they called themselves by a name denoting their deification of Al-Aykah, which was a tree which they used to worship; it was said that it was a group of trees which were tangled, like trees in a thicket. For this reason, when Allah said that the companions of Al-Aykah denied the Messengers, He did not say, \"When their brother Shu`ayb said to them.\" Rather, He said: ﴾إِذْ قَالَ لَهُمْ شُعَيْبٌ﴿ (When Shu`ayb said to them) He is not described as belonging to them because of the meaning that was inherent in the name given to them even though he was their brother by blood. Some people did not notice this point, so they thought that the dwellers of Al-Aykah were different from the people of Madyan, and claimed that Shu`ayb was sent to two nations; some said that he was sent to three. ﴾أَصْحَـبُ لْـَيْكَةِ﴿ (The companions of Al-Aykah) were the people of Shu`ayb. This was the view of Ishaq bin Bishr. Someone besides Juwaybir said, \"The dwellers of Al-Aykah and the people of Madyan are one and the same.\" And Allah knows best. Although there is another opinion that they were different nations with two identities, the correct view is that they were one nation, but they are described differently in different places. Shu`ayb preached to them and commanded them to be fair in their weights and measures, the same as is mentioned in the story of Madyan, which also indicates that they were the same nation. ﴾أَوْفُواْ الْكَيْلَ وَلاَ تَكُونُواْ مِنَ الْمُخْسِرِينَ - وَزِنُواْ بِالْقِسْطَاسِ الْمُسْتَقِيمِ ﴿﴾وَلاَ تَبْخَسُواْ النَّاسَ أَشْيَآءهُمْ وَلاَ تَعْثَوْاْ فِى الاْرْضِ مُفْسِدِينَ-﴿"
