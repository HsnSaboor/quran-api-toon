  3,41,"<h2>The Supplication of Zakariyya, and the Good News of Yahya's Birth</h2> When Zakariyya saw that Allah provided sustenance for Maryam by giving her the fruits of winter in summer and the fruits of summer in winter, he was eager to have a child of his own. By then, Zakariyya had become an old man, his bones feeble and his head full of gray hair. His wife was an old women who was barren. Yet, he still supplicated to Allah and called Him in secret, ﴾رَبِّ هَبْ لِى مِن لَّدُنْكَ﴿ (O my Lord! Grant me from Ladunka,) from You, ﴾ذُرِّيَّةً طَيِّبَةً﴿ (A good offspring) meaning, a righteous offspring, ﴾إِنَّكَ سَمِيعُ الدُّعَآءِ﴿ (You are indeed the All-Hearer of invocation.) Allah said, ﴾فَنَادَتْهُ الْمَلَـئِكَةُ وَهُوَ قَائِمٌ يُصَلِّى فِى الْمِحْرَابِ﴿ (Then the angels called him, while he was standing in prayer in the Mihrab,) meaning, the angels spoke to him directly while he was secluded, standing in prayer at his place of worship. Allah told us about the good news that the angels delivered to Zakariyya, ﴾أَنَّ اللَّهَ يُبَشِّرُكَ بِيَحْيَـى﴿ (Allah gives you glad tidings of Yahya, ) of a child from your offspring, his name is Yahya. Qatadah and other scholars said that he was called Yahya (literally, `he lives') because Allah filled his life with faith.  Allah said next, ﴾مُصَدِّقاً بِكَلِمَةٍ مِّنَ اللَّهِ﴿ (believing in the Word from Allah) Al-`Awfi reported that Ibn `Abbas said, and also Al-Hasan, Qatadah, `Ikrimah, Mujahid, Abu Ash-Sha`tha, As-Suddi, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, Ad-Dahhak, and several others said that the Ayah, ﴾مُصَدِّقاً بِكَلِمَةٍ مِّنَ اللَّهِ﴿ (believing in the Word from Allah) means, \"Believing in `Isa, son of Maryam.\"  Abu Al-`Aliyah, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, Qatadah and Sa`id bin Jubayr said that Allah's statement, ﴾وَسَيِّدًا﴿ (And Sayyidan) means, a wise man. Ibn `Abbas, Ath-Thawri and Ad-Dahhak said that Sayyidan means, \"The noble, wise and pious man.\" Sa`id bin Al-Musayyib said that Sayyid is the scholar and Faqih. `Atiyah said that Sayyid is the man noble in behavior and piety. `Ikrimah said that it refers to a person who is not overcome by anger, while Ibn Zayd said that it refers to the noble man. Mujahid said that Sayyidan means, honored by Allah.  Allah's statement, ﴾وَحَصُورًا﴿ (And Hasuran) does not mean he refrains from sexual relations with women, but that he is immune from illegal sexual relations. This does not mean that he does not marry women and have legal sexual relations with them, for Zakariyya said in his supplication for the benefit of Yahya, ﴾هَبْ لِى مِن لَّدُنْكَ ذُرِّيَّةً طَيِّبَةً﴿ (Grant me from You, a good offspring), meaning, grant me a son who will have offspring, and Allah knows best.  Allah's statement, ﴾وَنَبِيًّا مِّنَ الصَّـلِحِينَ﴿ (A Prophet, from among the righteous) delivers more good news of sending Yahya as Prophet after the good news that he will be born. This good news was even better than the news of Yahya's birth. In a similar statement, Allah said to the mother of Musa, ﴾إِنَّا رَآدُّوهُ إِلَيْكِ وَجَـعِلُوهُ مِنَ الْمُرْسَلِينَ﴿ (Verily, We shall bring him back to you, and shall make him one of the Messengers.) 28:7  When Zakariyya heard the good news, he started contemplating about having children at his age. He said, ﴾قَالَ رَبِّ أَنَّى يَكُونُ لِي غُلَـمٌ وَقَدْ بَلَغَنِي الْكِبَرُ وَامْرَأَتِى عَاقِرٌ قَالَ﴿ (\"O my Lord! How can I have a son when I am very old, and my wife is barren\" (He) said...) meaning the angel said, ﴾كَذَلِكَ اللَّهُ يَفْعَلُ مَا يَشَآءُ﴿ (\"Thus Allah does what He wills.\") meaning, this is Allah's matter, He is so Mighty that nothing escapes His power, nor is anything beyond His ability. ﴾قَالَ رَبِّ اجْعَل لِّى ءَايَةً﴿ (He said: \"O my Lord! Make a sign for me\") meaning make a sign that alerts me that the child will come, ﴾قَالَ ءَايَتُكَ أَلاَّ تُكَلِّمَ النَّاسَ ثَلَـثَةَ أَيَّامٍ إِلاَّ رَمْزًا﴿ ((Allah) said: \"Your sign is that you shall not speak to the people for three days except by signals.\") meaning, you will not be able to speak except with signals, although you are not mute. In another Ayah, Allah said, ﴾ثَلَـثَ لَيَالٍ سَوِيّاً﴿ (For three nights, though having no bodily defect.) 19:10  Allah then commanded Zakariyya to supplicate, thank and praise Him often in that condition, ﴾وَاذْكُر رَّبَّكَ كَثِيرًا وَسَبِّحْ بِالْعَشِىِّ وَالإِبْكَـرِ﴿ (And remember your Lord much and glorify (Him) in the afternoon and in the morning. )  We will elaborate more on this subject in the beginning of Surah Maryam (chapter 19), Allah willing.

  3,44,"<h2>The Virtue of Maryam Over the Women of Her Time</h2> Allah states that the angels spoke to Maryam by His command and told her that He chose her because of her service to Him, because of her modesty, honor, innocence, and conviction. Allah also chose her because of her virtue over the women of the world. At-Tirmidhi recorded that `Ali bin Abi Talib said, \"I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ say,  «خَيْرُ نِسَائِهَا مَرْيَمُ بِنْتُ عِمْرَانَ، وَخَيْرُ نِسَائِهَا خَدِيجَةُ بِنْتُ خُوَيْلِد»  (The best woman (in her time) was Maryam, daughter of `Imran, and the best woman (of the Prophet's time) is Khadijah (his wife), daughter of Khuwaylid.)\"  The Two Sahihs recorded this Hadith. Ibn Jarir recorded that Abu Musa Al-Ash`ari said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,  «كَمُلَ مِنَ الرِّجَالِ كَثِيرٌ، وَلَمْ يَكْمُلْ مِنَ النِّسَاءِ إِلَّا مَرْيَمُ بِنْتُ عِمْرَانَ وَ آسِيَةُ امْرَأَةُ فِرْعَوْن»  (Many men achieved perfection, but among women, only Maryam the daughter of `Imran and Asiah, the wife of Fir`awn, achieved perfection.)  The Six -- with the exception of Abu Dawud - recorded it. Al-Bukhari's wording for it reads,  «كَمُلَ مِنَ الرِّجَالِ كَثِيرٌ، وَلَمْ يَكْمُلْ مِنَ النِّسَاءِ إِلَّا آسِيَةُ امْرَأَةُ فِرْعَوْنَ، وَمَرْيَمُ بِنْتُ عِمْرَانَ، وَإِنَّ فَضْلَ عَائِشَةَ عَلَى النِّسَاءِ كَفَضْلِ الثَّرِيدِ عَلى سَائِرِ الطَّعَام»  (Many men reached the level of perfection, but no woman reached such a level except Asiah, the wife of Fir`awn, and Maryam, the daughter of `Imran. The superiority of `A'ishah (his wife) to other women, is like the superiority of Tharid (meat and bread dish) to other meals.)  We mentioned the various chains of narration and wordings for this Hadith in the story of `Isa, son of Maryam, in our book, Al-Bidayah wan-Nihayah, all the thanks are due to Allah.  Allah states that the angels commanded Maryam to increase acts of worship, humbleness, submission, prostration, bowing, and so forth, so that she would acquire what Allah had decreed for her, as a test for her. Yet, this test also earned her a higher grade in this life and the Hereafter, for Allah demonstrated His might by creating a son inside her without male intervention. Allah said,  يمَرْيَمُ اقْنُتِى لِرَبِّكِ وَاسْجُدِى وَارْكَعِى مَعَ الرَكِعِينَ  (\"O Maryam! Submit yourself with obedience (Aqnuti) and prostrate yourself, and bow down along with Ar-Raki`in.\")  As for Qunut (Aqnuti in the Ayah), it means to submit with humbleness. In another Ayah, Allah said,  بَل لَّهُ مَا فِي السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ كُلٌّ لَّهُ قَـنِتُونَ  (Nay, to Him belongs all that is in the heavens and on earth, and all surrender with obedience (Qanitun) to Him.) 2:116  Allah next said to His Messenger after He mentioned Maryam's story,  ذَلِكَ مِنْ أَنبَآءِ الْغَيْبِ نُوحِيهِ إِلَيْكَ  (This is a part of the news of the Ghayb which We reveal.) \"and narrate to you (O Muhammad ), \"  وَمَا كُنتَ لَدَيْهِمْ إِذْ يُلْقُون أَقْلَـمَهُمْ أَيُّهُمْ يَكْفُلُ مَرْيَمَ وَمَا كُنتَ لَدَيْهِمْ إِذْ يَخْتَصِمُونَ  (You were not with them, when they cast lots with their pens as to which of them should be charged with the care of Maryam; nor were you with them when they disputed.) meaning, \"You were not present, O Muhammad, when this occurred, so you cannot narrate what happened to the people as an eye witness. Rather, Allah disclosed these facts to you as if you were a witness, when they conducted a lottery to choose the custodian of Maryam, seeking the reward of this good deed.\"  Ibn Jarir recorded that `Ikrimah said, \"Maryam's mother left with Maryam, carrying her in her infant cloth, and took her to the rabbis from the offspring of Aaron, the brother of Musa. They were responsible for taking care of Bayt Al-Maqdis (the Masjid) at that time, just as there were those who took care of the Ka`bah. Maryam's mother said to them, `Take this child whom I vowed to serve the Masjid, I have set her free, since she is my daughter, for no menstruating woman should enter the Masjid, and I shall not take her back home.' They said, `She is the daughter of our Imam,' as `Imran used to lead them in prayer, `who took care of our sacrificial rituals.' Zakariyya said, `Give her to me, for her maternal aunt is my wife.' They said, `Our hearts cannot bear that you take her, for she is the daughter of our Imam.' So they conducted a lottery with the pens with which they wrote the Tawrah, and Zakariyya won the lottery and took Maryam into his care.\"'. `Ikrimah, As-Suddi, Qatadah, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, and several others said that the rabbis went into the Jordan river and conducted a lottery there, deciding to throw their pens into the river. The pen that remained afloat and idle would indicate that its owner would take care of Maryam. When they threw their pens into the river, the water took all the pens under, except Zakariyya's pen, which remained afloat in its place. Zakariyya was also their master, chief, scholar, Imam and Prophet, may Allah's peace and blessings be on him and the rest of the Prophets. "
