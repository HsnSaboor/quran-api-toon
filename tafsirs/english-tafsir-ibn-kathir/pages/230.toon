  11,73,"<h2>The Coming of the Angels to Ibrahim and Their Glad Tidings to Him of Ishaq and Ya`qub</h2> Allah, the Exalted, says,  ﴾وَلَقَدْ جَآءَتْ رُسُلُنَآ﴿ (And verily, there came Our messengers) The word \"messengers\" here means angels.  ﴾إِبْرَهِيمَ بِالْبُشْرَى﴿ (to Ibrahim with the glad tidings.) It has been said that the word \"the glad tidings\" means, \"Receive the glad tidings of Ishaq.\" Others have said that it means, \"The destruction of the people of Prophet Lut.\" The proof of the correctness of the first view is in Allah's statement,  ﴾فَلَمَّا ذَهَبَ عَنْ إِبْرَهِيمَ الرَّوْعُ وَجَآءَتْهُ الْبُشْرَى يُجَـدِلُنَا فِى قَوْمِ لُوطٍ ﴿ (Then when the fear had gone away from (the mind of) Ibrahim, and the glad tidings had reached him, he began to plead with Us for the people of Lut.)11:74  ﴾قَالُواْ سَلَـماً قَالَ سَلَـمٌ﴿ (They said: \"Salaman.\" He answered, \"Salamun.\") This means, \"Upon you.\" The scholars of explanation have said, \"Ibrahim's reply of `Salamun' was better than that with which they had greeted him with, because the subjective case (Salamun instead of Salaman) alludes to affirmation and eternity. \"  ﴾فَمَا لَبِثَ أَن جَآءَ بِعِجْلٍ حَنِيذٍ﴿ (and he hastened to entertain them with a roasted calf.) This means that he (Ibrahim) left with haste in order to bring them food, as a host. The food that he brought was a calf. The word Hanidh means roasted upon heated stones. This meaning has been reported from Ibn `Abbas, Qatadah and others. This is as Allah has said in another verse,  ﴾فَرَاغَ إِلَى أَهْلِهِ فَجَآءَ بِعِجْلٍ سَمِينٍ - فَقَرَّبَهُ إِلَيْهِمْ قَالَ أَلاَ تَأْكُلُونَ ﴿ (Then he turned to his household, and brought out a roasted calf. And placed it before them (saying): \"Will you not eat\")51:26-27 This verse contains many aspects of the etiquettes of hosting guests.  ﴾فَلَمَّا رَأَى أَيْدِيَهُمْ لاَ تَصِلُ إِلَيْهِ نَكِرَهُمْ﴿ (But when he saw their hands went not towards it (the meal), he mistrusted them,) This means that he felt estranged from them.  ﴾وَأَوْجَسَ مِنْهُمْ خِيفَةً﴿ (and conceived a fear of them.) This is because angels are not concerned with food. They do not desire it, nor do they eat it. Therefore, when Ibrahim saw them reject the food that he had brought them, without tasting any of it at all, he felt a mistrust of them.  ﴾وَأَوْجَسَ مِنْهُمْ خِيفَةً﴿ (and conceived a fear of them. ) As-Suddi said, \"When Allah sent the angels to the people of Lut, they set out walking in the form of young men, until they came to Ibrahim and they were hosted by him. When Ibrahim saw them, he rushed to host them.  ﴾فَرَاغَ إِلَى أَهْلِهِ فَجَآءَ بِعِجْلٍ سَمِينٍ ﴿ (Then he turned to his household, and brought out a roasted calf.)51:26 He slaughtered it (the calf), roasted it on hot stones and brought it to them. Then, he sat down with them. when he placed it before them. (saying): `Will you not eat' They said, `O Ibrahim! Verily, we do not eat food without a price.' Ibrahim then said, `Verily, this food has a price.' They said, `What is its price' He said, `You must mention the Name of Allah over it before eating it and praise Allah upon finishing it.' Jibril then looked at Mika'il and said, `This man has the right that his Lord should take him as an intimate friend.'  ﴾فَلَمَّا رَأَى أَيْدِيَهُمْ لاَ تَصِلُ إِلَيْهِ نَكِرَهُمْ﴿ (But when he saw their hands went not towards it (the meal), he mistrusted them,) When Ibrahim saw that they were not eating, he became scared and frightened by them. Then, when Sarah looked and saw that he was honoring them, she began to serve them and she was laughing. She said, `What amazing guests we have. We serve them ourselves, showing them respect and they do not eat our food.\"' Then, concerning Allah's statement about the angels,  ﴾قَالُواْ لاَ تَخَفْ﴿ (They said: \"Fear not,\") They were saying, \"Do not be afraid of us. Verily, we are angels sent to the people of Lut in order to destroy them.\" Then, Sarah laughed in delight of the good news of their destruction. This is because they had caused much corruption and their disbelief was severe. For this reason, she was rewarded with the glad tidings of a son, even after her despair. Concerning Allah's statement,  ﴾وَمِن وَرَآءِ إِسْحَـقَ يَعْقُوبَ﴿ (and after Ishaq, of Ya`qub.) This means that the son that she was going to have would have a son (her grandson) who would succeed him and beget many children. For verily, Ya`qub was the son of Ishaq, just as Allah says in Surat Al-Baqarah,  ﴾أَمْ كُنتُمْ شُهَدَآءَ إِذْ حَضَرَ يَعْقُوبَ الْمَوْتُ إِذْ قَالَ لِبَنِيهِ مَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن بَعْدِى قَالُواْ نَعْبُدُ إِلَـهَكَ وَإِلَـهَ آبَآئِكَ إِبْرَهِيمَ وَإِسْمَـعِيلَ وَإِسْحَـقَ إِلَـهًا وَاحِدًا وَنَحْنُ لَهُ مُسْلِمُونَ ﴿ (Or were you witnesses when death approached Ya'qub When he said unto his sons, \"What will you worship after me\" They said, \"We shall worship your God, the God of your fathers, Ibrahim, Isma`il, Ishaq, One God, and to him we submit.\") 2:133 From this point in this verse there is an evidence for those who say that Isma`il was the son of Ibrahim who was to be sacrificed. It could not have been Ishaq, because the glad tidings were given that he would have a son born to him named Ya`qub. So how could Ibrahim be commanded to sacrifice him when he was a small child and there had not been born to him a child yet, named Ya`qub, who was promised The promise of Allah is true and there is no breaking of Allah's promise. Therefore, it is not possible that Ibrahim was to sacrifice this child (Ishaq) with the condition being as it was. This makes it clear that Isma`il was the son that was to be sacrificed and this is the best, most correct and clearest evidence of that. And all praise is due to Allah. 9  ﴾قَالَتْ يوَيْلَتَا ءَأَلِدُ وَأَنَاْ عَجُوزٌ وَهَـذَا بَعْلِى شَيْخًا﴿ (She said (in astonishment): \"Woe unto me! Shall I bear a child while I am an old woman, and here is my husband an old man\") Allah speaks of her statement in this verse, just as He spoke of her action in another verse.  ﴾فَأَقْبَلَتِ امْرَأَتُهُ فِى صَرَّةٍ فَصَكَّتْ وَجْهَهَا وَقَالَتْ عَجُوزٌ عَقِيمٌ ﴿ (Then his wife came forward with a loud voice: she smote her face, and said: \"A barren old woman!\")51:29 This was the custom of the women in their speech and actions when they were expressing amazement.  ﴾قَالُواْ أَتَعْجَبِينَ مِنْ أَمْرِ اللَّهِ﴿ (Then said: \"Do you wonder at the decree of Allah\") This means that the angels were saying to her, \"Do not be amazed at the command of Allah, for verily, whenever He wants something, He merely says `Be' and it is. So do not be amazed at this, even though you are old and barren and your husband is a very old man. Verily, Allah is able to do whatever He wills.\"  ﴾رَحْمَتُ اللَّهِ وَبَرَكَـتُهُ عَلَيْكُمْ أَهْلَ الْبَيْتِ إِنَّهُ حَمِيدٌ مَّجِيدٌ﴿ (The mercy of Allah and His blessing be on you, O the family (of Ibrahim). Surely, He (Allah) is All-Praiseworthy, All-Glorious.) This means that He is the Most Praiseworthy in all of His actions and statements. He is praised and glorified in His Attributes and His Self. For this reason, it is confirmed in the two Sahihs that they (the Prophet's Companions) said, \"Verily, we already know how to greet you with Salam (peace), but how do we send Salah (prayer) upon you, O Messenger of Allah\" He said,  ﴾«قُولُوا: اللَّهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلَى مُحَمَّدٍ وَعَلَى آلِ مُحَمَّدٍ كَمَا صَلَّيْتَ عَلَى إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَآلِ إبْرَاهِيمَ، وَبَارِكْ عَلَى مُحَمَّدٍ وَعَلَى آلِ مُحَمَّدٍ كَمَا بَارَكْتَ عَلَى آلِ إِبْرَاهِيمَ إِنَّكَ حَمِيدٌ مَجِيد»﴿ (Say, \"O Allah, send prayers upon Muhammad and the family of Muhammad, just as You have sent prayers upon Ibrahim and the family of Ibrahim. And bless Muhammad and the family of Muhammad, just as You have blessed the family of Ibrahim. Truly, You are the All-Praiseworthy, All-Glorious.\")  "

  11,76,"<h2>The Dispute of Ibrahim over the People of Lut</h2> Allah, the Exalted, informs of what happened after the fright of Ibrahim left him and he felt no more fear of the angels when they refused to eat. After this, they gave him the glad tidings of the birth of a son and the destruction of the people of Lut. When they told him of this, he spoke to them as Sa`id bin Jubayr narrated concerning this verse. Sa`id said: When Jibril and the other angels who were with him came to Ibrahim, they said,  ﴾إِنَّا مُهْلِكُو أَهْلِ هَـذِهِ الْقَرْيَةِ﴿ (Verily, we are going to destroy the people of this town.) Ibrahim said to them, \"Will you destroy a town that has three hundred believers in it\" They said, \"No.\" He then said, \"Will you destroy a town that has two hundred believers in it\" They said, \"No.\" He said, \"Will you destroy a town that has forty believers in it\" They said, \"No.\" He then said, \"Thirty\" They still replied, \"No.\" This continued until he said, \"Five\" They said, \"No.\" Then he said, \"What do you think if there is one Muslim man in the town, would you destroy it\" They said, \"No.\" With this, Ibrahim said,  ﴾إِنَّ فِيهَا لُوطاً قَالُواْ نَحْنُ أَعْلَمُ بِمَن فِيهَا لَنُنَجِّيَنَّهُ وَأَهْلَهُ إِلاَّ امْرَأَتَهُ﴿ (But there is Lut in it. They said: \"We know better who is there. We will verily, save him and his family except his wife.\") Therefore, Ibrahim remained silent and his soul was at rest. Concerning Allah's statement,  ﴾إِنَّ إِبْرَهِيمَ لَحَلِيمٌ أَوَّاهٌ مُّنِيبٌ ﴿ (Verily, Ibrahim was, without doubt, forbearing, used to invoke Alllah with humility, and was repentant (to Allah).) 11:75 This is a commendation for Ibrahim because of these beautiful characteristics. Then Allah says,  ﴾يإِبْرَهِيمُ أَعْرِضْ عَنْ هَـذَآ إِنَّهُ قَدْ جَآءَ أَمْرُ رَبِّكَ﴿ (O Ibrahim! Forsake this. Indeed, the commandment of your Lord has gone forth.) This means the decree was settled concerning them and the Word was already given that they should be destroyed. The evil torment was coming to them, that cannot be averted from wicked people.  "

  11,79,"<h2>The Coming of the Angels to Lut, His Grief, and His Discussion with His People</h2> Allah, the Exalted, informs about the coming of His messenger angels. After they informed Ibrahim of their mission to destroy the people of Lut, they left him and set out to destroy Lut's people that very night. After leaving Ibrahim, they came to Lut. Some say that they came to him while he was on a piece of land that belonged to him. Others say that they came to him while he was in his home. They approached him while they were in the most handsome of forms. They appeared in the forms of young men with handsome faces. This was a test from Allah that contained much wisdom and a firm evidence. Their appearance saddened him (Lut) and he felt grief in his soul because of them. He was afraid that if he did not host them as his guests, someone else of his people would host them and harm them.  ﴾وَقَالَ هَـذَا يَوْمٌ عَصِيبٌ﴿ (He said: \"This is a distressful day.\") Ibn `Abbas and others said that this means, \"A severe test for him.\" This was because he knew that he would have to defend them and it would cause great problems for him. Qatadah said, \"They came to him while he was on a piece of land that belonged to him. They requested him to host them. He agreed, but he was shy of them and he walked in front of them. On the way to his home he said to them in attempt to convince them to go away, `By Allah, I do not know any people on the face of the earth more wicked and disgusting than these people of this town.' Then he walked on a little further. Then he repeated the same statement to them. He continued doing this until he had repeated the same thing four times.\" Then Qatadah said, \"They were ordered not to destroy them until their Prophet testified against them of this.\" Concerning Allah's statement,  ﴾يُهْرَعُونَ إِلَيْهِ﴿ (rushing towards him.) meaning, they made haste and rushed due to their delight of this (new young men). Concerning the statement,  ﴾وَمِن قَبْلُ كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ السَّيِّئَاتِ﴿ (and since aforetime they used to commit crimes.) This means that this did not cease being their behavior until they were seized (by Allah's torment) and they were still in the same condition.  ﴾قَالَ يقَوْمِ هَـؤُلاءِ بَنَاتِى هُنَّ أَطْهَرُ لَكُمْ﴿ (He said: \"O my people! Here are my daughters (the women of the nation), they are purer for you...\") This was his attempt to direct them to their women, for verily the Prophet is like a father for his nation. Therefore, he tries to guide them to that which is better for them in this life and the Hereafter. This is similar to his statement to them in another verse,  ﴾أَتَأْتُونَ الذُّكْرَانَ مِنَ الْعَـلَمِينَ - وَتَذَرُونَ مَا خَلَقَ لَكُمْ رَبُّكُمْ مِّنْ أَزْوَجِكُمْ بَلْ أَنتُمْ قَوْمٌ عَادُونَ ﴿ (Go you in unto the males of the nation, and leave those whom Allah has created for you to be your wives Nay, you are a trespassing people!)26:165-166 Allah said in another verse,  ﴾قَالُواْ أَوَلَمْ نَنْهَكَ عَنِ الْعَـلَمِينَ ﴿ (They (the people of the city) said: \"Did we not forbid you from entertaining any of the `Alamin\")15:70 This means, \"Didn't we forbid you from hosting men (male) guests\"  ﴾قَالَ هَـؤُلآءِ بَنَاتِى إِن كُنْتُمْ فَـعِلِينَ - لَعَمْرُكَ إِنَّهُمْ لَفِى سَكْرَتِهِمْ يَعْمَهُونَ ﴿ (Lut said: \"These (the girls of the nation) are my daughters, if you must act (so).\" Verily, by your life, in their wild intoxication, they were wandering blindly.)15:71-72 Then, Allah said, in this noble verse,  ﴾هَـؤُلاءِ بَنَاتِى هُنَّ أَطْهَرُ لَكُمْ﴿ (Here are my daughters, they are purer for you.) Mujahid said, \"Actually, they were not his daughters, but they were from among his nation. Every Prophet is like a father to his nation.\" A similar statement has been reported from Qatadah and others. Concerning the statement,  ﴾فَاتَّقُواْ اللَّهَ وَلاَ تُخْزُونِ فِى ضَيْفِى﴿ (So have Taqwa of Allah and disgrace me not with regard to my guests!) This means, \"Accept what I command you by limiting the fulfillment of your desires to your women.\"  ﴾أَلَيْسَ مِنْكُمْ رَجُلٌ رَّشِيدٌ﴿ (Is there not among you a single right-minded man) This means, \"Is there not a good man among you who will accept what I am enjoining upon you and abandon what I have forbidden for you\"  ﴾قَالُواْ لَقَدْ عَلِمْتَ مَا لَنَا فِى بَنَاتِكَ مِنْ حَقٍّ﴿ (They said: \"Surely, you know that we have no need of your daughters...\") This means, \"Verily, you know that we do not want our women, nor do we desire them.\"  ﴾وَإِنَّكَ لَتَعْلَمُ مَا نُرِيدُ﴿ (and indeed you know well what we want!) This means, \"We only want males and you know that. So what need is there for you to continue speaking to us about this\"  ﴾قَالَ لَوْ أَنَّ لِى بِكُمْ قُوَّةً أَوْ آوِى إِلَى رُكْنٍ شَدِيدٍ ﴿"
  11,80,"1554"
  11,81,"<h2>Lut's Inability, His Desire for Strength and the Angels' Informing Him of the Reality</h2> Allah, the Exalted says that Lut was threatening them with his statement,  لَوْ أَنَّ لِى بِكُمْ قُوَّةً  (Would that I had strength (men) to overpower you,) meaning, `I would surely have made an example of you and done (harm) to you from myself and my family.' In this regard, there is a Hadith which is reported from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,  «رَحْمَةُ اللهِ عَلَى لُوطٍ لَقَدْ كَانَ يَأْوِي إِلَى رُكْنٍ شَدِيد»  يَعْنِي اللهَ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ  «فَمَا بَعَثَ اللهُ بَعْدَهُ مِنْ نَبِيَ إِلَّا فِي ثَرْوَةٍ مِنْ قَوْمِه»  (May Allah's mercy be upon Lut, for verily, he betook himself to a powerful support --meaning Allah, the Mighty and Sublime. Allah did not send any Prophet after him, except amidst an influential family among his people.) With this, the angels informed him that they were the messengers of Allah ﷺ sent to them. They also told him that his people would not be able to reach him (with any harm).  قَالُواْ يلُوطُ إِنَّا رُسُلُ رَبِّكَ لَن يَصِلُواْ إِلَيْكَ  (They (messengers said): \"O Lut! Verily, we are the messengers from your Lord! They shall not reach you!) They commanded him to travel with his family during the last part of night and that he should follow them from behind. In this way it would be as though he were driving his family (as a cattle herder).  وَلاَ يَلْتَفِتْ مِنكُمْ أَحَدٌ  (and let not any of you look back;) This means, \"If you hear the sound of what (torment) befalls them (the people of the village), do not rush towards that disturbing noise. Rather, continue leaving.\"  إِلاَّ امْرَأَتَكَ  (but your wife,) Most of the scholars said that this means that she would not travel at night and she did not go with Lut. Rather, she stayed in her house and was destroyed. Others said that it means that she looked back (during the travel). This later group says that she left with them and when she heard the inevitable destruction, she turned and looked back. When she looked she said, \"O my people!\" Thus, a stone came down from the sky and killed her. Then they (the angels) brought close to him the destruction of his people as good news for him, because he said to them, \"Destroy them in this very hour.\" They replied,  إِنَّ مَوْعِدَهُمُ الصُّبْحُ أَلَيْسَ الصُّبْحُ بِقَرِيبٍ  (Indeed, morning is their appointed time. Is not the morning near) They were saying this while Luts people were standing at his door. They tried to rush his door from all sides and Lut was standing at the door repelling them, deterring them and trying to prevent them from what they were doing. Yet, they would not listen to him. Instead, they threatened him and sought to intimidate him. At this point, Jibril came out to them and struck them in their faces with his wing. This blow blinded their eyes and they retreated, unable to see their way. This is as Allah said,  وَلَقَدْ رَاوَدُوهُ عَن ضَيْفِهِ فَطَمَسْنَآ أَعْيُنَهُمْ فَذُوقُواْ عَذَابِى وَنُذُرِ  (And they indeed sought to shame his guest (asking to commit sodomy with them). So We blinded their eyes (saying), \"Then taste you My torment and My warnings.\")54:37  فَلَمَّا جَآءَ أَمْرُنَا جَعَلْنَا عَـلِيَهَا سَافِلَهَا وَأَمْطَرْنَا عَلَيْهَا حِجَارَةً مِّن سِجِّيلٍ مَّنْضُودٍ "
