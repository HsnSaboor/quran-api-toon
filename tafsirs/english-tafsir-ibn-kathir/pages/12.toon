tafsir[7]{c,v,t}:
  2,77,"<h2>There was little Hope that the Jews Who lived during the Time of the Prophet could have believed</h2> Allah said,  أَفَتَطْمَعُونَ  (Do you covet) O believers,  أَن يُؤْمِنُواْ لَكُمْ  (That they will believe in your religion) meaning, that these people would obey you They are the deviant sect of Jews whose fathers witnessed the clear signs but their hearts became hard afterwards. Allah said next,  وَقَدْ كَانَ فَرِيقٌ مِّنْهُمْ يَسْمَعُونَ كَلَـمَ اللَّهِ ثُمَّ يُحَرِّفُونَهُ  (Inspite of the fact that a party of them (Jewish rabbis) used to hear the Word of Allah (the Tawrah), then they used to change it) meaning, distort its meaning,  مِن بَعْدِ مَا عَقَلُوهُ  (after they understood it). They understood well, yet they used to defy the truth,  وَهُمْ يَعْلَمُونَ  (knowingly), being fully aware of their erroneous interpretations and corruption. This statement is similar to Allah's statement,  فَبِمَا نَقْضِهِم مِّيثَـقَهُمْ لَعنَّـهُمْ وَجَعَلْنَا قُلُوبَهُمْ قَاسِيَةً يُحَرِّفُونَ الْكَلِمَ عَن مَّوَضِعِهِ  (So, because of their violation of their covenant, We cursed them and made their hearts grow hard. They change the words from their (right) places) (5:13).  Qatadah commented that Allah's statement;  ثُمَّ يُحَرِّفُونَهُ مِن بَعْدِ مَا عَقَلُوهُ وَهُمْ يَعْلَمُونَ  (Then they used to change it knowingly after they understood it) \"They are the Jews who used to hear Allah's Words and then alter them after they understood and comprehended them.\" Also, Mujahid said, \"Those who used to alter it and conceal its truths; they were their scholars.\" Also, Ibn Wahb said that Ibn Zayd commented,  يَسْمَعُونَ كَلَـمَ اللَّهِ ثُمَّ يُحَرِّفُونَهُ  (used to hear the Word of Allah (the Tawrah), then they used to change it) \"They altered the Tawrah that Allah revealed to them, making it say that the lawful is unlawful and the prohibited is allowed, and that what is right is false and that what is false is right. So when a person seeking the truth comes to them with a bribe, they judge his case by the Book of Allah, but when a person comes to them seeking to do evil with a bribe, they take out the other (distorted) book, in which it is stated that he is in the right. When someone comes to them who is not seeking what is right, nor offering them bribe, then they enjoin righteousness on him. This is why Allah said to them,  أَتَأْمُرُونَ النَّاسَ بِالْبِرِّ وَتَنسَوْنَ أَنفُسَكُمْ وَأَنتُمْ تَتْلُونَ الْكِتَـبَ أَفَلاَ تَعْقِلُونَ  (Enjoin you Al-Birr (piety and righteousness and every act of obedience to Allah) on the people and you forget (to practise it) yourselves, while you recite the Scripture (the Tawrah)! Have you then no sense) (2:44)\" <h2>The Jews knew the Truth of the Prophet , but disbelieved in Him</h2> Allah said next,  وَإِذَا لَقُواْ الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ قَالُواْ ءَامَنَّا وَإِذَا خَلاَ بَعْضُهُمْ إِلَى بَعْضٍ  (And when they (Jews) meet those who believe (Muslims), they say, \"We believe\", but when they meet one another in private..). Muhammad bin Ishaq reported that Ibn `Abbas commented,  وَإِذَا لَقُواْ الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ قَالُوا ءَامَنَّا  (And when they (Jews) meet those who believe (Muslims), they say, \"We believe\") \"They believe that Muhammad ﷺ is the Messenger of Allah, `But he was only sent for you (Arabs)\"' However, when they meet each other they say, \"Do not convey the news about this Prophet to the Arabs, because you used to ask Allah to grant you victory over them when he came, but he was sent to them (not to you).\" Allah then revealed,  وَإِذَا لَقُواْ الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ قَالُواْ ءَامَنَّا وَإِذَا خَلاَ بَعْضُهُمْ إِلَى بَعْضٍ قَالُواْ أَتُحَدِّثُونَهُم بِمَا فَتَحَ اللَّهُ عَلَيْكُمْ لِيُحَآجُّوكُم بِهِ عِندَ رَبِّكُمْ  (And when they (Jews) meet those who believe (Muslims), they say, \"We believe,\" but when they meet one another in private, they say, \"Shall you (Jews) tell them (Muslims) what Allah has revealed to you, that they (Muslims) may argue with you (Jews) about it before your Lord\") meaning, \"If you admit to them that he is a Prophet, knowing that Allah took the covenant from you to follow him, they will know that Muhammad ﷺ is the Prophet that we were waiting for and whose coming we find foretold of in our Book. Therefore, do not believe in him and deny him.\" Allah said,  أَوَلاَ يَعْلَمُونَ أَنَّ اللَّهَ يَعْلَمُ مَا يُسِرُّونَ وَمَا يُعْلِنُونَ  (Know they (Jews) not that Allah knows what they conceal and what they reveal).  Al-Hasan Al-Basri said, \"When the Jews met the believers they used to say, `We believe.' When they met each other, some of them would say, `Do not talk to the companions of Muhammad ﷺ about what Allah has foretold in your Book, so that the news (that Muhammad ﷺ is the Final Messenger) does not become a proof for them against you with your Lord, and, thus, you will win the dispute.\"' Further, Abu Al-`Aliyah said about Allah's statement,  أَوَلاَ يَعْلَمُونَ أَنَّ اللَّهَ يَعْلَمُ مَا يُسِرُّونَ وَمَا يُعْلِنُونَ  (Know they (Jews) not that Allah knows what they conceal and what they reveal), \"Meaning their secret denial and rejection of Muhammad ﷺ, although they find his coming recorded in their Book.\" This is also the Tafsir of Qatadah. Al-Hasan commented on,  أَنَّ اللَّهَ يَعْلَمُ مَا يُسِرُّونَ  (That Allah knows what they conceal), \"What they concealed refers to when they were alone with each other away from the Companions of Muhammad ﷺ . Then they would forbid each other from conveying the news that Allah revealed to them in their Book to the Companions of Muhammad ﷺ, fearing that the Companions would use this news (about the truth of Muhammad ) against them before their Lord.\"  وَمَا يُعْلِنُونَ  (And what they reveal) meaning, when they said to the Companions of Muhammad ﷺ,  ءَامَنَّا  (We believe), as Abu Al-`Aliyah, Ar-Rabi` and Qatadah stated.  وَمِنْهُمْ أُمِّيُّونَ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ الْكِتَـبَ إِلاَّ أَمَانِىَّ وَإِنْ هُمْ إِلاَّ يَظُنُّونَ "
  2,78,"86"
  2,79,"<h2>The Meaning of `Ummi</h2> Allah said,  ﴾وَمِنْهُمْ أُمِّيُّونَ﴿ (And there are among them Ummyyun people) meaning, among the People of the Book, as Mujahid stated. Ummyyun, is plural for Ummi, that is, a person who does not write, as Abu Al-`Aliyah, Ar-Rabi`, Qatadah, Ibrahim An-Nakha`i and others said. This meaning is clarified by Allah's statement,  ﴾لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ الْكِتَـبَ﴿ (Who know not the Book) meaning, are they not aware of what is in it.   Ummi was one of the descriptions of the Prophet because he was unlettered. For instance, Allah said,  ﴾وَمَا كُنتَ تَتْلُو مِن قَبْلِهِ مِن كِتَـبٍ وَلاَ تَخُطُّهُ بِيَمِينِكَ إِذاً لاَّرْتَـبَ الْمُبْطِلُونَ ﴿ (Neither did you (O Muhammad ) read any book before it (this Qur'an) nor did you write any book (whatsoever) with your right hand. In that case, indeed, the followers of falsehood might have doubted) (29:48).   Also, the Prophet said,  ﴾«إِنَّا أُمَّةٌ أُمِّيَّةٌ لَا نَكْتُبُ وَلَا نَحْسِبُ، الشَّهْرُ هكَذَا وَهكَذَا وَهكَذَا»﴿ (We are an Ummi nation, neither writing nor calculating. The (lunar) month is like this, this and this (i.e. thirty or twenty-nine days.)   This Hadith stated that Muslims do not need to rely on books, or calculations to decide the timings of their acts of worship. Allah also said,  ﴾هُوَ الَّذِى بَعَثَ فِى الأُمِّيِّينَ رَسُولاً مِّنْهُمْ﴿ (He it is Who sent among the Ummiyyin ones a Messenger (Muhammad ) from among themselves) (62:2).  <h2>The Explanation of Amani</h2> Ad-Dahhak said that Ibn `Abbas said that Allah's statement,  ﴾إِلاَّ أَمَانِىَّ﴿ (But they trust upon Amani) means, \"It is just a false statement that they utter with their tongues.\" It was also said that Amani means `wishes and hopes'. Mujahid commented, \"Allah described the Ummiyyin as not understanding any of the Book that Allah sent down to Musa, yet they create lies and falsehood.\" Therefore, the word Amani mentioned here refers to lying and falsehood. Mujahid said that Allah's statement,  ﴾وَإِنْ هُمْ إِلاَّ يَظُنُّونَ﴿ (And they but guess) means, \"They lie.\" Qatadah, Abu Al-`Aliyah and Ar-Rabi` said that it means, \"They have evil false ideas about Allah.\"  <h2>Woe unto Those Criminals among the Jews</h2> Allah said,  ﴾فَوَيْلٌ لِّلَّذِينَ يَكْتُبُونَ الْكِتَـبَ بِأَيْدِيهِمْ ثُمَّ يَقُولُونَ هَـذَا مِنْ عِندِ اللَّهِ لِيَشْتَرُواْ بِهِ ثَمَنًا قَلِيلاً﴿ (Then Waylun (woe) to those who write the book with their own hands and then say, \"This is from Allah,\" to purchase with it a little price!).   This is another category of people among the Jews who called to misguidance with falsehood and lies about Allah, thriving on unjustly amassing people's property. `Waylun (woe)' carries meanings of destruction and perishing, and it is a well-known word in the Arabic language. Az-Zuhri said that `Ubadydullah bin `Abdullah narrated that Ibn `Abbas said, \"O Muslims! How could you ask the People of the Book about anything, while the Book of Allah (Qur'an) that He revealed to His Prophet is the most recent Book from Him and you still read it fresh and young Allah told you that the People of the Book altered the Book of Allah, changed it and wrote another book with their own hands. They then said, `This book is from Allah,' so that they acquired a small profit by it. Hasn't the knowledge that came to you prohibited you from asking them By Allah! We have not seen any of them asking you about what was revealed to you.\" This Hadith was also collected by Al-Bukhari. Al-Hasan Al-Basri said, \"The little amount here means this life and all that it contains.\"   Allah's statement,  ﴾فَوَيْلٌ لَّهُمْ مِّمَّا كَتَبَتْ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَوَيْلٌ لَّهُمْ مِّمَّا يَكْسِبُونَ﴿ (Woe to them for what their hands have written and woe to them for that they earn thereby) means, \"Woe to them because of what they have written with their own hands, the lies, falsehood and alterations. Woe to them because of the property that they unjustly acquired.\" Ad-Dahhak said that Ibn `Abbas commented,  ﴾فَوَيْلٌ لَّهُمْ﴿ (Woe to them), \"Means the torment will be theirs because of the lies that they wrote with their own hands,  ﴾وَوَيْلٌ لَّهُمْ مِّمَّا يَكْسِبُونَ﴿ (And woe to them for that they earn thereby), which they unjustly acquired from people, be they commoners or otherwise.\"  "
  2,80,"<h2>The Jews hope They will only remain in the Fire for a Few Days</h2> Allah mentioned the claim of the Jews, that the Fire will only touch them for a few days, and then they will be saved from it. Allah refuted this claim by saying,  قُلْ أَتَّخَذْتُمْ عِندَ اللَّهِ عَهْدًا  (Say (O Muhammad to them): \"Have you taken a covenant from Allah'). Hence, the Ayah proclaims, `if you had a promise from Allah for that, then Allah will never break His promise. However, such promise never existed. Rather, what you say, about Allah, you have no knowledge of and you thus utter a lie about Him.' Al-`Awfi said that Ibn `Abbas said about the Ayah,  وَقَالُواْ لَن تَمَسَّنَا النَّارُ إِلاَّ أَيَّامًا مَّعْدُودَةً  (And they (Jews) say, \"The Fire shall not touch us but for a few numbered days.\"). \"The Jews said, `The Fire will only touch us for forty days.\"' Others added that this was the period during which the Jews worshipped the calf.  (When Khaybar was conquered, a roasted poisoned sheep was presented to the Prophet as a gift (by the Jews). The Messenger of Allah ﷺ ordered, `Assemble before me all the Jews who were here.' The Jews were summoned and the Prophet said (to them), `Who is your father' They replied, `So-and-so.' He said, `You have lied; your father is so-and-so.' They said, `You have uttered the truth.' He said, `Will you now tell me the truth, if I ask you about something' They replied, `Yes, O Abul-Qasim; and if we should tell a lie, you will know our lie as you have about our fathers.' On that he asked, `Who are the people of the (Hell) Fire' They said, `We shall remain in the (Hell) Fire for a short period, and after that you will replace us in it.' The Prophet said, `May you be cursed and humiliated in it! By Allah, we shall never replace you in it.' Then he asked, `Will you tell me the truth if I ask you a question' They said, `Yes, O Abul-Qasim.' He asked, `Have you poisoned this sheep' They said, `Yes.' He asked, `What made you do so' They said, `We wanted to know if you were a liar, in which case we would get rid of you, and if you were a Prophet then the poison would not harm you.') Imam Ahmad, Al-Bukhari and An-Nasa'i recorded similarly. "
  2,81,"89"
  2,82," Allah says, the matter is not as you have wished and hoped it to be. Rather, whoever does an evil deed and abides purposefully in his error, coming on the Day of Resurrection with no good deeds, only evil deeds, then he will be among the people of the Fire.  وَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّـلِحَاتِ  (And those who believe and do righteous good deeds) meaning, \"They believe in Allah and His Messenger and perform the good deeds that conform with the Islamic Law. They shall be among the people of Paradise.\" Allah said in a similar statement,  لَّيْسَ بِأَمَـنِيِّكُمْ وَلا أَمَانِىِّ أَهْلِ الْكِتَـبِ مَن يَعْمَلْ سُوءًا يُجْزَ بِهِ وَلاَ يَجِدْ لَهُ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ وَلِيّاً وَلاَ نَصِيراً - وَمَن يَعْمَلْ مِنَ الصَّـلِحَـتَ مِن ذَكَرٍ أَوْ أُنثَى وَهُوَ مُؤْمِنٌ فَأُوْلَـئِكَ يَدْخُلُونَ الْجَنَّةَ وَلاَ يُظْلَمُونَ نَقِيراً  (It will not be in accordance with your desires (Muslims), nor those of the People of the Scripture (Jews and Christians), whosoever works evil, will have the recompense thereof, and he will not find any protector or helper besides Allah. And whoever does righteous good deeds, male or female, and is a (true) believer in the Oneness of Allah (Muslim), such will enter Paradise and not the least injustice, even the size of a Naqira (speck on the back of a date stone), will be done to them) (4: 123-124).  Also, Abu Hurayrah, Abu Wa'il, `Ata', and Al-Hasan said that,  وَأَحَـطَتْ بِهِ خَطِيـَـتُهُ  (And his sin has surrounded him) means, \"His Shirk (polytheism) has surrounded him.\" Also, Al-A`mash reported from Abu Razin that Ar-Rabi` bin Khuthaym said,  وَأَحَـطَتْ بِهِ خَطِيـَـتُهُ  (And his sin has surrounded him), \"Whoever dies before repenting from his wrongs.\" As-Suddi and Abu Razin said similarly. Abu Al-`Aliyah, Mujahid, Al-Hasan, Qatadah and Ar-Rabi` bin Anas said that,  وَأَحَـطَتْ بِهِ خَطِيـَـتُهُ  (And his sin has surrounded him) refers to major sins. All of these statements carry similar meanings, and Allah knows best. <h2>When Small Sins gather, They bring about Destruction</h2> Here we should mention the Hadith that Imam Ahmad recorded, in which `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,  «إِيَّاكُمْ وَمُحَقَّرَاتِ الذُّنُوبِ فَإِنَّهُنَّ يَجْتَمِعْنَ عَلَى الرَّجُلِ حَتّى يُهْلِكْنَه»  (Beware of the belittled sins, because they gather on a person until they destroy him.)  He then said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ gave them an example,  «كَمَثَلٍ قَوْمٍ نَزَلُوا بِأَرْضِ فَلَاةٍ، فَحَضَرَ صَنِيعُ الْقَوْمِ فَجَعَلَ الرَّجُلُ يَنْطَلِقُ فَيَجِيءُ بِالْعُودِ وَالرَّجُلُ يَجِيءُ بِالْعُودِ، حَتّى جَمَعُوا سَوَادًا وَأَجَّجُوا نَارًا فَأَنْضَجُوا مَا قَذَفُوا فِيهَا»  (This is the example of people who set up camp on a flat land, and then their servants came. One of them collected some wood and another man collected some wood until they collected a great deal. They then started a fire and cooked what they put on it.)  Muhammad bin Ishaq reported that Ibn `Abbas said that,  وَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّـلِحَاتِ أُوْلَـئِكَ أَصْحَـبُ الْجَنَّةِ هُمْ فِيهَا خَـلِدُونَ  (And those who believe and do righteous good deeds, they are dwellers of Paradise, they will dwell therein forever) \"Whoever believes in what you (Jews) did not believe in and implements what you refrained from implementing of Muhammad's ﷺ religion, shall acquire Paradise for eternity. Allah stated that the recompense for good or evil works shall remain with its people for eternity. \" "
  2,83,"<h2>The Covenant that Allah took from the Children of Israel</h2> Allah reminded the Children of Israel of the commandments that He gave them, and the covenants that He took from them to abide by those commands, and how they intentionally and knowingly turned away from all of that. Allah commanded them to worship Him and to associate none with Him in worship, just as He has commanded all of His creatures, for this is why Allah created them. Allah said,  ﴾وَمَآ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ مِن رَّسُولٍ إِلاَّ نُوحِى إِلَيْهِ أَنَّهُ لا إِلَـهَ إِلاَّ أَنَاْ فَاعْبُدُونِ ﴿ (And We did not send any Messenger before you (O Muhammad ) but We revealed to him (saying): La ilaha illa Ana none has the right to be worshipped but I (Allah), so worship Me (alone and none else)) (21:25), and,  ﴾وَلَقَدْ بَعَثْنَا فِى كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَّسُولاً أَنِ اعْبُدُواْ اللَّهَ وَاجْتَنِبُواْ الْطَّـغُوتَ﴿ (And verily, We have sent among every Ummah (community, nation) a Messenger (proclaiming): \"Worship Allah (alone), and avoid the Taghut (all false deities,)) (16:36).   This is the highest and most important right, that is, Allah's right that He be worshipped alone without partners.   After that comes the right of the creatures, foremost, the right of the parents. Allah usually mentions the rights of the parents along with His rights. For instance, Allah said,  ﴾أَنِ اشْكُرْ لِى وَلِوَلِدَيْكَ إِلَىَّ الْمَصِيرُ﴿ (Give thanks to Me and to your parents. Unto Me is the final destination) (31:14). Also, Allah said,  ﴾وَقَضَى رَبُّكَ أَلاَّ تَعْبُدُواْ إِلاَّ إِيَّـهُ وَبِالْوَلِدَيْنِ إِحْسَـناً﴿ (And your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him. And that you be dutiful to your parents) (17:23), until,  ﴾وَءَاتِ ذَا الْقُرْبَى حَقَّهُ وَالْمِسْكِينَ وَابْنَ السَّبِيلِ﴿ (And give to the kinsman his due and to the Miskin (poor) and to the wayfarer) (17:26). The Two Sahihs record that Ibn Mas`ud said,  ﴾قُلْتُ:﴿﴾«يَا رَسُولَ اللهِ أيُّ الْعَمَل أَفْضَلُ؟ قَالَ:﴿﴾«الصَّلَاةُ عَلى وَقْتِهَا»﴿﴾قُلْتُ: ثُمَّ أَيٌّ؟ قَالَ:﴿﴾«بِرُّ الْوَالِدَيْن»﴿﴾قُلْتُ: ثُمَّ أَيٌّ؟ قَالَ:﴿﴾«الْجِهَادُ فِي سَبِيلِ الله»﴿ (I said, `O Messenger of Allah! What is the best deed' He said, `Performing the prayer on time.' I said, 'Then what' He said, `Being kind to one's parents.' I said, `Then what' He said, `Jihad in the cause of Allah.')   Allah then said,  ﴾وَالْيَتَـمَى﴿ (and to orphans) meaning, the young who have no fathers to fend for them.  ﴾وَالْمَسَـكِينُ﴿ (and Al-Masakin (the poor)), plural for Miskin, the one who does not find what he needs to spend on himself and his family. We will discuss these categories when we explain the Ayah of Surat An-Nisa` where Allah said,  ﴾وَاعْبُدُواْ اللَّهَ وَلاَ تُشْرِكُواْ بِهِ شَيْئاً وَبِالْوَلِدَيْنِ إِحْسَـناً﴿ (Worship Allah and join none with Him (in worship); and do good to parents) (4:36).   Allah's statement,  ﴾وَقُولُواْ لِلنَّاسِ حُسْنًا﴿ (and speak good to people) meaning, say good words to them and be lenient with them, this includes commanding good and forbidding evil. Al-Hasan Al-Basri commented on Allah's statement,  ﴾وَقُولُواْ لِلنَّاسِ حُسْنًا﴿ (and speak good to people), \".`The good saying' means commanding good and forbidding evil, and being patient and forgiving. The `good words to people', as Allah commanded, also includes every good type of behavior that Allah is pleased with.\" Imam Ahmad narrated that Abu Dharr said that the Prophet said,  ﴾«لَا تَحْقِرَنَّ مِنَ الْمَعْرُوفِ شَيْئًا وَإِنْ لَمْ تَجِدْ فَالْقَ أَخَاكَ بِوَجْهٍ مُنْطَلِق»﴿ (Do not belittle any form of righteousness, and even if you did not find any good deed except meeting your brother with a smiling face, then do so.)   This Hadith was also collected by Muslim in his Sahih and At-Tirmidhi, who graded it Sahih.   Allah commands the servants to say good words to people, after He commanded them to be kind to them, thereby mentioning two categories of manners: good speech and good actions. He then emphasized the command to worship Him and the command to do good, ordaining the prayer and the Zakah,  ﴾وَأَقِيمُواْ الصَّلوةَ وَآتُواْ الزَّكَوةَ﴿ (and perform As-Salah and give Zakah). Allah informed us that the People of the Book, except for a few among them, ignored these orders, that is, they knowingly and intentionally abandoned them. Allah ordered this Ummah similarly in Surat An-Nisa' when He said,  ﴾وَاعْبُدُواْ اللَّهَ وَلاَ تُشْرِكُواْ بِهِ شَيْئاً وَبِالْوَلِدَيْنِ إِحْسَـناً وَبِذِى الْقُرْبَى وَالْيَتَـمَى وَالْمَسَـكِينِ وَالْجَارِ ذِى الْقُرْبَى وَالْجَارِ الْجُنُبِ وَالصَّـحِبِ بِالجَنْبِ وَابْنِ السَّبِيلِ وَمَا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَـنُكُمْ إِنَّ اللَّهَ لاَ يُحِبُّ مَن كَانَ مُخْتَالاً فَخُوراً ﴿ (Worship Allah and join none with Him (in worship); and do good to parents, kinsfolk, orphans, Al-Masakin (the poor), the neighbor who is near of kin, the neighbor who is a stranger, the companion by your side, the wayfarer (you meet), and those (servants) whom your right hands possess. Verily, Allah does not like such as are proud and boastful) (4:36).   Of these orders, this Ummah has practiced what no other nation before it has, and all praise is due to Allah.  "
