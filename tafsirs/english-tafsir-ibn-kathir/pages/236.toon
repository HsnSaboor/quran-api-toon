  12,5,"<h2>Ya`qub orders Yusuf to hide His Vision to avoid Shaytan's Plots</h2> Allah narrates the reply Ya`qub gave his son Yusuf when he narrated to him the vision that he saw, which indicated that his brothers would be under his authority. They would be subjugated to Yusuf's authority to such an extent that they would prostrate before him in respect, honor and appreciation. Ya`qub feared that if Yusuf narrated his vision to any of his brothers, they would envy him and conspire evil plots against him. This is why Ya`qub said to Yusuf,  لاَ تَقْصُصْ رُءْيَاكَ عَلَى إِخْوَتِكَ فَيَكِيدُواْ لَكَ كَيْدًا  (Relate not your vision to your brothers, lest they should arrange a plot against you.) This Ayah means, \"They might arrange a plot against you that causes your demise.\" In the Sunnah, there is a confirmed Hadith that states,  «إِذَا رَأَى أَحَدُكُمْ مَا يُحِبُّ فَلْيُحَدِّثْ بِهِ، وَإِذَا رَأَى مَا يَكْرَهُ فَلْيَتَحَوَّلْ إِلَى جَنْبِهِ الْآخَرِ، وَلْيَتْفُلْ عَنْ يَسَارِهِ ثَلَاثًا، وَلْيَسْتَعِذْ بِاللهِ مِنْ شَرِّهَا، وَلَا يُحَدِّثْ بِهَا أَحَدًا فَإِنَّهَا لَنْ تَضُرَّه»  (If any of you saw a vision that he likes, let him narrate it. If he saw a dream that he dislikes, let him turn on his other side, blow to his left thrice, seek refuge with Allah from its evil and not tell it to anyone. Verily, it will not harm him in this case.) In another Hadith that Imam Ahmad and collectors of the Sunan collected, Mu`awiyah bin Haydah Al-Qushayri said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,  «الرُّؤْيَا عَلَى رِجْلِ طَائِرٍ مَا لَمْ تُعْبَرْ، فَإِذَا عُبِرَتْ وَقَعَت»  (The dream is tied to a bird's leg, as long as it is not interpreted. If it is interpreted, it comes true.) Therefore, one should hide the prospects or the coming of a bounty until it comes into existence and becomes known. The Prophet said,  «اسْتَعِينُوا عَلَى قَضَاءِ الْحَوَائِجِ بِكِتْمَانِهَا، فَإِنَّ كُلَّ ذِي نِعْمَةٍ مَحْسُود»  (Earn help for fulfilling needs by being discrete, for every owner of a blessing is envied.) "
  12,6,"<h2>Interpretation of Yusuf's Vision</h2> Allah says that Ya`qub said to his son Yusuf, `Just as Allah chose you to see the eleven stars, the sun and the moon prostrate before you in a vision,  ﴾وَكَذلِكَ يَجْتَبِيكَ رَبُّكَ﴿ (Thus will your Lord choose you) designate and assign you to be a Prophet from Him,  ﴾وَيُعَلِّمُكَ مِن تَأْوِيلِ الاٌّحَادِيثِ﴿ (and teach you the interpretation of Ahadith).' Mujahid and several other scholars said that this part of the Ayah is in reference to the interpreting of dreams. He said next,  ﴾وَيُتِمُّ نِعْمَتَهُ عَلَيْكَ﴿ (and perfect His favor on you), `by His Message and revelation to you.' This is why Ya`qub said afterwards,  ﴾كَمَآ أَتَمَّهَآ عَلَى أَبَوَيْكَ مِن قَبْلُ إِبْرَهِيمَ﴿ (as He perfected it aforetime on your fathers, Ibrahim...), Allah's intimate friend,  ﴾وَإِسْحَـقَ﴿ (and Ishaq), Ibrahim's son,  ﴾إِنَّ رَبَّكَ عَلِيمٌ حَكِيمٌ﴿ (Verily, your Lord is All-Knowing, All-Wise.) Allah knows best whom to chose for His Messages.  "

  12,10,"<h2>There are Lessons to draw from the Story of Yusuf</h2>  Allah says that there are Ayat, lessons and wisdom to learn from the story of Yusuf and his brothers, for those who ask about their story and seek its knowledge. Surely, their story is unique and is worthy of being narrated.  ﴾إِذْ قَالُواْ لَيُوسُفُ وَأَخُوهُ أَحَبُّ إِلَى أَبِينَا مِنَّا﴿ (When they said: \"Truly, Yusuf and his brother are dearer to our father than we...\") They swore, according to their false thoughts, that Yusuf and his brother Binyamin (Benjamin), Yusuf's full brother,  ﴾أَحَبُّ إِلَى أَبِينَا مِنَّا وَنَحْنُ عُصْبَةٌ﴿ (dearer to our father than we, while we are `Usbah.) meaning, a group. Therefore, they thought, how can he love these two more than the group,  ﴾إِنَّ أَبَانَا لَفِى ضَلَلٍ مُّبِينٍ﴿ (Really, our father is in a plain error.) because he preferred them and loved them more than us.  ﴾اقْتُلُواْ يُوسُفَ أَوِ اطْرَحُوهُ أَرْضًا يَخْلُ لَكُمْ وَجْهُ أَبِيكُمْ﴿ (Kill Yusuf or cast him out to some (other) land, so that the favor of your father may be given to you alone,) They said, `Remove Yusuf, who competes with you for your father's love, from in front of your father's face so that his favor is yours alone. Either kill Yusuf or banish him to a distant land so that you are rid of his trouble and you alone enjoy the love of your father. '  ﴾وَتَكُونُواْ مِن بَعْدِهِ قَوْمًا صَـلِحِينَ﴿ (and after that you will be righteous folk.), thus intending repentance before committing the sin,  ﴾قَالَ قَآئِلٌ مِّنْهُمْ﴿ (One from among them said...) Qatadah and Muhammad bin Ishaq said that he was the oldest among them and his name was Rubil (Reuben). As-Suddi said that his name was Yahudha (Judah). Mujahid said that it was Sham`un (Simeon) who said,  ﴾لاَ تَقْتُلُواْ يُوسُفَ﴿ (Kill not Yusuf,), do not let your enmity and hatred towards him reach this level, of murder. However, their plot to kill Yusuf would not have succeeded, because Allah the Exalted willed that Yusuf fulfill a mission that must be fulfilled and complete; he would receive Allah's revelation and become His Prophet. Allah willed Yusuf to be a powerful man in Egypt and govern it. Consequently, Allah did not allow them to persist in their intent against Yusuf, through Rubil's words and his advice to them that if they must do something, they should throw him down to the bottom of a well,  ﴾يَلْتَقِطْهُ بَعْضُ السَّيَّارَةِ﴿ (he will be picked up by some caravan) of travelers passing by. This way, he said, you will rid yourselves of this bother without having to kill him,  ﴾إِن كُنتُمْ فَـعِلِينَ﴿ (if you must do something,) meaning, if you still insist on getting rid of him. Muhammad bin Ishaq bin Yasar said, \"They agreed to a particularly vicious crime that involved cutting the relation of the womb, undutiful treatment of parents, and harshness towards the young, helpless and sinless. It was also harsh towards the old and weak who have the rights of being respected, honored and appreciated, as well as, being honored with Allah and having parental rights on their offspring. They sought to separate the beloved father, who had reached old age and his bones became weak, yet had a high status with Allah, from his beloved young son, in spite of his weakness, tender age and his need of his father's compassion and kindness. May Allah forgive them, and indeed, He is the Most Merciful among those who have mercy, for they intended to carry out a \"grave error.\" Ibn Abi Hatim collected this state- ment, from the route of Salamah bin Al-Fadl from Muhammad bin Ishaq.

  12,12,"<h2>Yusuf's Brothers ask for Their Father's Permission to take Yusuf with Them</h2> When Yusuf's brothers agreed to take him and throw him down the well, taking the advice of their elder brother Rubil, they went to their father Ya`qub, peace be upon him. They said to him, \"Why is it that you,  ﴾لاَ تَأْمَنَّا عَلَى يُوسُفَ وَإِنَّا لَهُ لَنَـصِحُونَ﴿ (do not trust us with Yusuf though we are indeed his well-wishers).\" They started executing their plan by this introductory statement, even though they really intended its opposite, out of envy towards Yusuf for being loved by his father. They said,  ﴾أَرْسِلْهُ مَعَنَا﴿ \"(Send him with us) tomorrow so that we all enjoy ourselves and play.\" Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and As-Suddi said similarly. Yusuf's brothers said next,  ﴾وَإِنَّا لَهُ لَحَـفِظُونَ﴿ (and verily, we will take care of him.), we will protect him and ensure his safety for you.  "
  12,13,"1610"
  12,14,"<h2>Ya`qub's Answer to Their Request</h2> Allah narrates to us that His Prophet Ya`qub said to his children, in response to their request that he send Yusuf with them to the desert to tend their cattle,  ﴾إِنِّى لَيَحْزُنُنِى أَن تَذْهَبُواْ بِهِ﴿ (Truly, it saddens me that you should take him away.) He said that it was hard on him that he be separated from Yusuf for the duration of their trip, until they came back. This demonstrates the deep love that Ya`qub had for his son, because he saw in Yusuf great goodness and exalted qualities with regards to conduct and physical attractiveness associated with the rank of prophethood. May Allah's peace and blessings be on him. Prophet Ya`qub's statement next,  ﴾وَأَخَافُ أَن يَأْكُلَهُ الذِّئْبُ وَأَنْتُمْ عَنْهُ غَـفِلُونَ﴿ (I fear lest a wolf should devour him, while you are careless of him.) He said to them, `I fear that you might be careless with him while you are tending the cattle and shooting, then a wolf might come and eat him while you are unaware.' They heard these words from his mouth and used them in their response for what they did afterwards. They also gave a spontaneous reply for their father's statement, saying,  ﴾لَئِنْ أَكَلَهُ الذِّئْبُ وَنَحْنُ عُصْبَةٌ إِنَّآ إِذَا لَّخَـسِرُونَ﴿ (If a wolf devours him, while we are an `Usbah, then surely, we are the losers.) They said, `If a wolf should attack and devour him while we are all around him in a strong group, then indeed we are the losers and weak.'  "
