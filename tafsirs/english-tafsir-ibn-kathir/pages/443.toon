  36,44,"<h2>Among the Signs of Allah is that He carried Them in the laden Ship</h2> Allah tells us: another sign for them of His might and power is that He has subjugated the sea to carry ships, including -- most significantly -- the ship of Nuh , peace be upon him, in which Allah saved him and the believers, apart from whom none of the descendants of Adam were left on the face of the earth. Allah says: ﴾وَءَايَةٌ لَّهُمْ أَنَّا حَمَلْنَا ذُرِّيَّتَهُمْ﴿ (And an Ayah for them is that We bore their offspring) means, their forefathers, ﴾فِى الْفُلْكِ الْمَشْحُونِ﴿ (in the laden ship.) means, in the ship which was filled with luggage and animals, in which Allah commanded him to put two of every kind. Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"Laden means filled.\" This was also the view of Sa`id bin Jubayr, Ash-Sha`bi, Qatadah and As-Suddi. Ad-Dahhak, Qatadah and Ibn Zayd said, \"This was the ship of Nuh peace be upon him.\" ﴾وَخَلَقْنَا لَهُمْ مِّن مِّثْلِهِ مَا يَرْكَبُونَ ﴿ (And We have created for them of the like thereunto, on which they ride.) Al-`Awfi said, narrating from Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, \"This means the camel, for it is the ship of the land on which they carry goods and on which they ride. \" Ibn Jarir recorded that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"Do you know what the Ayah: ﴾وَخَلَقْنَا لَهُمْ مِّن مِّثْلِهِ مَا يَرْكَبُونَ ﴿ (And We have created for them of the like thereunto, on which they ride.) refers to\" We said, \"No.\" He said, \"This refers to the ships which were made after the ship of Nuh, peace be upon him, which was similar to it.\" This was also the view of Abu Malik, Ad-Dahhak, Qatadah, Abu Salih and As-Suddi, that the Ayah ﴾وَخَلَقْنَا لَهُمْ مِّن مِّثْلِهِ مَا يَرْكَبُونَ ﴿ (And We have created for them of the like thereunto, on which they ride.) refers to ships. ﴾وَإِن نَّشَأْ نُغْرِقْهُمْ﴿ (And if We will, We shall drown them,) means, those who are on board the ships. ﴾فَلاَ صَرِيخَ لَهُمْ﴿ (and there will be no shout for them) means, there will be no one to save them from their predicament. ﴾وَلاَ هُمْ يُنقَذُونَ﴿ (nor will they be saved. ) means, from what has befallen them. ﴾إِلاَّ رَحْمَةً مِّنَّا﴿ (Unless it be a mercy from Us,) means, `but by Our mercy We make it easy for you to travel on land and sea, and We keep you safe until an appointed time.' Allah says: ﴾وَمَتَاعاً إِلَى حِينٍ﴿ (and as an enjoyment for a while.) meaning, until a time that is known to Allah, may He be glorified and exalted. "

  36,47,"<h2>The Misguidance of the Idolators</h2> Allah tells us how the idolators persisted in their misguidance and in not paying attention to the sins that they had committed in the past or what was to happen to them in the future, on the Day of Resurrection. ﴾وَإِذَا قِيلَ لَهُمُ اتَّقُواْ مَا بَيْنَ أَيْدِيكُمْ وَمَا خَلْفَكُمْ﴿ (And when it is said to them: \"Fear of that which is before you, and that which is behind you...\") Mujahid said, \"This refers to sins.\" Others said it is the opposite. ﴾لَعَلَّكُمْ تُرْحَمُونَ﴿ (in order that you may receive mercy.) means, `so that, if you fear such things Allah will have mercy on you and will save you from His punishment.' The wording implies that they would not respond. Rather that they would turn away and ignore that, as Allah says: ﴾وَمَا تَأْتِيهِم مِّنْ ءَايَةٍ مِّنْ ءَايَـتِ رَبِّهِمْ﴿ (And never came an Ayah from among the Ayat of their Lord to them,) meaning, signs of Tawhid and the truth of the Messengers, ﴾إِلاَّ كَانُواْ عَنْهَا مُعْرِضِينَ﴿ (but they did turn away from it,) means, they did not accept it or benefit from it. ﴾وَإِذَا قِيلَ لَهُمْ أَنفِقُواْ مِمَّا رِزَقَكُمُ الله﴿ (And when it is said to them: \"Spend of that with which Allah has provided you,\") means, when they are told to spend of that which Allah has provided to them on the poor and needy among the Muslims, ﴾قَالَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ لِلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ﴿ (those who disbelieve say to those who believe) means, about the believers who are poor, i.e., they say to those believers who tell them to spend on the needy, ﴾أَنُطْعِمُ مَن لَّوْ يَشَآءُ اللَّهُ أَطْعَمَهُ﴿ (Shall we feed those whom, if Allah willed, He (Himself) would have fed) meaning, `those whom you are telling us to spend on, if Allah had wanted to, He would have made them independent and fed them from His provision, so we are in accordance with the will of Allah with regard to them. ﴾إِنْ أَنتُمْ إِلاَّ فِى ضَلَـلٍ مُّبِينٍ﴿ (You are only in a plain error.) means, `by telling us to do that.'

  36,50,"<h2>The Disbelievers thought that the Day of Resurrection would never come to pass</h2> Allah tells us how the disbelievers thought that the Day of Resurrection would never come to pass, as they said: ﴾مَتَى هَـذَا الْوَعْدُ﴿ (\"When will this promise be fulfilled...\") ﴾يَسْتَعْجِلُ بِهَا الَّذِينَ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِهَا﴿ (Those who believe not therein seek to hasten it) (42:18). Allah says: ﴾مَا يَنظُرُونَ إِلاَّ صَيْحَةً وَحِدَةً تَأُخُذُهُمْ وَهُمْ يَخِصِّمُونَ ﴿ (They await only but a single Sayhah which will seize them while they are disputing!) meaning, they are only waiting for a single shout which -- and Allah knows best -- will be the trumpet blast of terror when the Trumpet will be blown while the people are in their marketplaces and places of work, arguing and disputing as they usually do. While in this state, Allah will command Israfil to blow into the Trumpet, so he will sound a long note and there will be no one left on the face of the earth except he will tilt his head to listen to the sound coming from heaven. Then the people who are alive will be driven to the gathering place by a fire which will surround them on all sides. Allah says: ﴾فَلاَ يَسْتَطِيعُونَ تَوْصِيَةً﴿ (Then they will not be able to make bequest, ) meaning, with regard to their possessions, because the matter is more serious than that, ﴾وَلاَ إِلَى أَهْلِهِمْ يَرْجِعُونَ﴿ (nor they will return to their family.) Numerous Hadiths and reports have been narrated about this, which we have mentioned elsewhere. After this there will be the Trumpet blast which will cause everyone who is alive to die, besides the One Who is Ever Living, Eternal. Then after that the trumpet blast of the resurrection will be sounded. "

  36,54,"<h2>The Trumpet Blast of the Resurrection</h2> This will be the third blast of the trumpet, the trumpet blast of the resurrection when people will come forth from their graves. Allah says: ﴾فَإِذَا هُم مِّنَ الاٌّجْدَاثِ إِلَى رَبِّهِمْ يَنسِلُونَ﴿ (and behold from the graves they will come out quickly to their Lord.) Yansilun means they will be walking quickly. This is like the Ayah: ﴾يَوْمَ يَخْرُجُونَ مِنَ الاٌّجْدَاثِ سِرَاعاً كَأَنَّهُمْ إِلَى نُصُبٍ يُوفِضُونَ ﴿ (The Day when they will come out of the graves quickly as racing to a goal.) (70:43). ﴾قَالُواْ يوَيْلَنَا مَن بَعَثَنَا مِن مَّرْقَدِنَا﴿ (They will say: \"Woe to us! Who has raised us up from our place of sleep.\") meaning, their graves, which in this world they thought they would never be raised from. When they see with their own eyes that in which they had disbelieved, ﴾قَالُواْ يوَيْلَنَا مَن بَعَثَنَا مِن مَّرْقَدِنَا﴿ (They will say: \"Woe to us! Who has raised us up from our place of sleep.\") This does not contradict the fact that they will be punished in their graves, because in comparison to what is to come afterwards, that will seem like a nap. Ubayy bin Ka`b, may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid, Al-Hasan and Qatadah said, \"They will sleep before the Resurrection.\" Qatadah said, \"That will be between the two trumpet blasts, they will say, `Who has raised us up from our place of sleep\"' When they say that, the believers will respond. This was the view of more than one of the Salaf. ﴾هَذَا مَا وَعَدَ الرَّحْمـنُ وَصَدَقَ الْمُرْسَلُونَ﴿ ((It will be said to them): \"This is what the Most Gracious had promised, and the Messengers spoke truth!\") Al-Hasan said, \"The angels will reply to them in this manner. There is no contradiction because both are possible. And Allah knows best. ﴾إِن كَانَتْ إِلاَّ صَيْحَةً وَحِدَةً فَإِذَا هُمْ جَمِيعٌ لَّدَيْنَا مُحْضَرُونَ ﴿ (It will be but a single Sayhah, so behold they will all be brought up before Us!) This is like the Ayat: ﴾فَإِنَّمَا هِىَ زَجْرَةٌ وَحِدَةٌ - فَإِذَا هُم بِالسَّاهِرَةِ ﴿ (But it will be only a single Zajrah, when behold, they find themselves (on the surface of the earth) alive (after their death).) (79:13-14), ﴾وَمَآ أَمْرُ السَّاعَةِ إِلاَّ كَلَمْحِ الْبَصَرِ أَوْ هُوَ أَقْرَبُ﴿ (And the matter of the Hour is not but as a twinkling of the eye, or even nearer) (16:77), and ﴾يَوْمَ يَدْعُوكُمْ فَتَسْتَجِيبُونَ بِحَمْدِهِ وَتَظُنُّونَ إِن لَّبِثْتُمْ إِلاَّ قَلِيلاً ﴿ (On the Day when He will call you, and you will answer (His call) with (words of) His praise and obedience, and you will think that you have stayed (in this world) but a little while!) (17:52) which means, `We will issue but one command, and all of them will be gathered together.' ﴾فَالْيَوْمَ لاَ تُظْلَمُ نَفْسٌ شَيْئاً﴿ (This Day, none will be wronged in anything,) means, with regard to his deeds. ﴾وَلاَ تُجْزَوْنَ إِلاَّ مَا كُنْتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ﴿ (nor will you be requited anything except that which you used to do.)
