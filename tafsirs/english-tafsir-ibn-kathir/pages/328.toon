  21,75,"<h2>The Migration of Ibrahim to Ash-Sham (Greater Syria), accompanied by Lut</h2> Allah tells us that He saved Ibrahim from the fire lit by his people, and brought him out from among them, migrating to the land of Ash-Sham, to the sacred regions thereof. ﴾وَوَهَبْنَا لَهُ إِسْحَـقَ وَيَعْقُوبَ نَافِلَةً﴿ (And We bestowed upon him Ishaq, and Ya`qub Nafilatan.) `Ata' and Mujahid said, \"Nafilatan means as a gift.\" Ibn `Abbas, Qatadah and Al-Hakam bin `Uyaynah said, \"The gift of a son who has a son,\" meaning that Ya`qub was the son of Ishaq, as Allah says: ﴾فَبَشَّرْنَـهَا بِإِسْحَـقَ وَمِن وَرَآءِ إِسْحَـقَ يَعْقُوبَ﴿ (But We gave her glad tidings of Ishaq, and after Ishaq, of Ya`qub) 11:71. `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam said, \"He asked for one son, and said, ﴾رَبِّ هَبْ لِى مِنَ الصَّـلِحِينِ ﴿ (\"My Lord! Grant me from the righteous.\") So Allah gave him Ishaq, and gave him Ya`qub in addition. ﴾وَكُلاًّ جَعَلْنَا صَـلِحِينَ﴿ (Each one We made righteous. ) means, both of them were good and righteous people. ﴾وَجَعَلْنَاهُمْ أَئِمَّةً﴿ (And We made them leaders,) means, examples to be followed. ﴾يَهْدُونَ بِأَمْرِنَا﴿ (guiding by Our command,) inviting to Him by His leave. Allah says: ﴾وَأَوْحَيْنَآ إِلَيْهِمْ فِعْلَ الْخَيْرَتِ وَإِقَامَ الصَّلوة وَإِيتَآءَ الزَّكَـوةِ﴿ (and We revealed to them the doing of good deeds, performing Salah, and the giving of Zakah,) Here the general is followed by the specific. ﴾وَكَانُواْ لَنَا عَـبِدِينَ﴿ (and of Us (Alone) they were the worshippers.) means, they did what they enjoined others to do. <h2>The Prophet Lut</h2> Then Allah mentions Lut, whose full name was Lut bin Haran bin Azar. He believed in Ibrahim and followed him, and migrated with him, as Allah says: ﴾فَـَامَنَ لَهُ لُوطٌ وَقَالَ إِنِّى مُهَاجِرٌ إِلَى رَبِّى﴿ (So Lut believed in him. He (Ibrahim) said: \"I will emigrate for the sake of my Lord\") 29:26. Allah gave him wisdom and knowledge; He sent Revelation to him, made him a Prophet and appointed him to Sadum (Sodom) and its vicinity, but they rejected him and resisted him, so Allah utterly destroyed them, as He tells us in several places in His Book. Allah says; ﴾وَلُوطاً آتَيْنَـهُ حُكْماً وَعِلْماً وَنَجَّيْنَـهُ مِنَ الْقَرْيَةِ الَّتِى كَانَت تَّعْمَلُ الْخَبَـئِثَ إِنَّهُمْ كَانُواْ قَوْمَ سَوْءٍ فَـسِقِينَ - وَأَدْخَلْنَـهُ فِى رَحْمَتِنَآ إِنَّهُ مِنَ الصَّـلِحِينَ ﴿ (and We saved him from the town who practised Al-Khaba'ith. Verily, they were a people given to evil, and were rebellious. And We admitted him to Our mercy; truly, he was of the righteous.) "

  21,77,"<h2>Nuh and His People</h2> Allah tells us how He responded to His servant and Messenger Nuh, peace be upon him, when he prayed to Him against his people for their disbelief in him: ﴾فَدَعَا رَبَّهُ أَنُّى مَغْلُوبٌ فَانتَصِرْ ﴿ (Then he invoked his Lord (saying): \"I have been overcome, so help (me)!\") 54:10 ﴾وَقَالَ نُوحٌ رَّبِّ لاَ تَذَرْ عَلَى الاٌّرْضِ مِنَ الْكَـفِرِينَ دَيَّاراً - إِنَّكَ إِن تَذَرْهُمْ يُضِلُّواْ عِبَادَكَ وَلاَ يَلِدُواْ إِلاَّ فَاجِراً كَفَّاراً ﴿ (And Nuh said: \"My Lord! Leave not any inhabitant of the disbelievers on the earth! If You leave them, they will mislead Your servants, and they will beget none but wicked disbelievers) 71:26-27. So Allah says here, ﴾إِذْ نَادَى مِن قَبْلُ فَاسْتَجَبْنَا لَهُ فَنَجَّيْنَـهُ وَأَهْلَهُ﴿ (And (remember) Nuh, when he cried (to Us) aforetime. We answered to his invocation and saved him and his family) meaning, those who believed with him, as Allah says elsewhere: ﴾وَأَهْلَكَ إِلاَّ مَن سَبَقَ عَلَيْهِ الْقَوْلُ وَمَنْ ءَامَنَ وَمَآ ءَامَنَ مَعَهُ إِلاَّ قَلِيلٌ﴿ (...and your family -- except him against whom the Word has already gone forth -- and those who believe. And none believed with him, except a few) 11: 40. ﴾مِنَ الْكَرْبِ الْعَظِيمِ﴿ (from the great dis- tress.) meaning, from difficulty, rejection and harm. For he remained among them for one thousand years less fifty, calling them to Allah, and no one had believed in him except for a few. His people were plotting against him and advising one another century after century, generation after generation, to oppose him. ﴾وَنَصَرْنَـهُ مِنَ الْقَوْمِ﴿ (We helped him against the people) means, `We saved him and helped him against the people,' ﴾الَّذِينَ كَذَّبُواْ بِـَايَـتِنَا إِنَّهُمْ كَانُواْ قَوْمَ سَوْءٍ فَأَغْرَقْنَـهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ﴿ (who denied Our Ayat. Verily, they were a people given to evil. So We drowned them all.) meaning, Allah drowned them all, and not one of them was left on the face of the earth, as their Prophet had prayed would happen to them. ﴾وَدَاوُودَ وَسُلَيْمَـنَ إِذْ يَحْكُمَانِ فِى الْحَرْثِ إِذْ نَفَشَتْ فِيهِ غَنَمُ الْقَوْمِ وَكُنَّا لِحُكْمِهِمْ شَـهِدِينَ ﴿"
