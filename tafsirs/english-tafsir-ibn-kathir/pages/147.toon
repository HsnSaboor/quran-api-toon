  6,144,"<h2>These Ayat demonstrate the ignorance of the Arabs before Islam.</h2> They used to prohibit the usage of some of their cattle and designate them as Bahirah, Sa'ibah, Wasilah and Ham etc. These were some of the innovations they invented for cattle, fruits and produce. Allah stated that He has created gardens, trellised and untrellised, and cattle, as animals of burden and as Farsh. Allah next mentioned various kinds of cattle, male and female, such as sheep and goats. He also created male and female camels and the same with cows. Allah did not prohibit any of these cattle or their offspring. Rather, they all were created for the sons of Adam as a source for food, transportation, work, milk, and other benefits, which are many. Allah said,  ﴾وَأَنزَلَ لَكُمْ مِّنَ الاٌّنْعَـمِ ثَمَـنِيَةَ أَزْوَجٍ﴿ (And He has sent down for you of cattle eight pairs...) 39:6 Allah said;  ﴾أَمَّا اشْتَمَلَتْ عَلَيْهِ أَرْحَامُ الأُنثَيَيْنِ﴿ (...or (the young) which the wombs of the two females enclose...) This refutes the idolators' statement,  ﴾مَا فِى بُطُونِ هَـذِهِ الأَنْعَـمِ خَالِصَةٌ لِّذُكُورِنَا وَمُحَرَّمٌ عَلَى أَزْوَجِنَا﴿ (What is in the bellies of such and such cattle is for our males alone, and forbidden to our females.) 6:139 Allah said,  ﴾نَبِّئُونِي بِعِلْمٍ إِن كُنتُمْ صَـدِقِينَ﴿ (Inform me with knowledge if you are truthful.) meaning, tell me with sure knowledge, how and when did Allah prohibit what you claimed is prohibited, such as the Bahirah, Sa'ibah, Wasilah and Ham etc. Al-`Awfi said that Ibn `Abbas said, \"Allah's statement,  ﴾ثَمَـنِيَةَ أَزْوَجٍ مِّنَ الضَّأْنِ اثْنَيْنِ وَمِنَ الْمَعْزِ اثْنَيْنِ﴿ (Eight pairs: of the sheep two, and of the goats two...) these are four pairs,  ﴾قُلْ ءَآلذَّكَرَيْنِ حَرَّمَ أَمِ الأُنثَيَيْنِ﴿ (Say: \"Has He forbidden the two males or the two females...\") I (Allah) did not prohibit any of these.  ﴾أَمَّا اشْتَمَلَتْ عَلَيْهِ أَرْحَامُ الأُنثَيَيْنِ﴿ (or (the young) which the wombs of the two females enclose) and does the womb produce but males and females So why do you prohibit some and allow some others  ﴾نَبِّئُونِي بِعِلْمٍ إِن كُنتُمْ صَـدِقِينَ﴿ (Inform me with knowledge if you are truthful. ) Allah is saying that all of this is allowed.\" Allah said,  ﴾أَمْ كُنتُمْ شُهَدَآءَ إِذْ وَصَّـكُمُ اللَّهُ بِهَـذَا﴿ (Or, were you present when Allah ordered you such a thing) mocking the idolators' innovations, and their lies that Allah made sacred what they have prohibited.  ﴾فَمَنْ أَظْلَمُ مِمَّنِ افْتَرَى عَلَى اللَّهِ كَذِبًا لِيُضِلَّ النَّاسَ بِغَيْرِ عِلْمٍ﴿ (Then who does more wrong than one who invents a lie against Allah, to lead mankind astray without knowledge.) Therefore, no one is more unjust than the people described here and  ﴾إِنَّ اللَّهَ لاَ يَهْدِى الْقَوْمَ الظَّـلِمِينَ﴿ (Certainly, Allah guides not the people who are wrongdoers.) The person most worthy of this condemnation is `Amr bin Luhay bin Qum`ah. He was the first person to change the religion of the Prophets and designate the Sa'ibah, Wasilah and Ham, as mentioned in the Sahih.  "
  6,145,"<h2>Forbidden Things</h2> Allah commands His servant and Messenger, Muhammad ,  قُلْ  (Say) O Muhammad to those who prohibited what Allah has provided them, claiming this falsehood to be from Allah,  لاَ أَجِدُ فِى مَآ أُوْحِىَ إِلَىَّ مُحَرَّمًا عَلَى طَاعِمٍ يَطْعَمُهُ  (I find not in that which has been revealed to me anything forbidden to be eaten by one who wishes to eat it,) This Ayah means, I do not find any animals that are prohibited, except these mentioned here. We should mention here that the prohibited things mentioned in Surat Al-Ma'idah and the Hadiths on this subject amend the meaning of this Ayah.  أَوْ دَمًا مَّسْفُوحًا  (or blood poured.) Qatadah commented, \"Poured blood was prohibited, but the meat that still has some blood in it is allowed.\" Al-Humaydi said that Sufyan narrated to us that `Amr bin Dinar narrated to us, \"I said to Jabir bin `Abdullah, `They claim that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ prohibited the meat of donkeys during (the day of) Khaybar.' He said, `Al-Hakam bin `Amr narrated that from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. That scholar - refering to Ibn `Abbas - denied it, reciting the Ayah;  قُل لاَ أَجِدُ فِى مَآ أُوْحِىَ إِلَىَّ مُحَرَّمًا عَلَى طَاعِمٍ يَطْعَمُهُ  (Say: \"I find not in that which has been revealed to me anything forbidden to be eaten by one who wishes to eat it...\")\"' Al-Bukhari and Abu Dawud collected it. Abu Bakr bin Marduwyah and Al-Hakim, in his Mustadrak, recorded that Ibn `Abbas said, \"During the time of Jahiliyyah, the people used to eat some things and avoid some other things, because they disliked them. Later on, Allah sent His Prophet , revealed His Book, allowed what He allowed, and prohibited what He prohibited. Therefore, whatever Allah allowed is lawful and whatever He prohibited is unlawful. Whatever He did not mention, there is no sin in it.\" He then recited the Ayah,  قُل لاَ أَجِدُ فِى مَآ أُوْحِىَ إِلَىَّ مُحَرَّمًا عَلَى طَاعِمٍ يَطْعَمُهُ  (Say: \"I find not in that which has been revealed to me anything forbidden to be eaten by one who wishes to eat it...\") This is the wording with Ibn Marduwyah. Abu Dawud also recorded this statement, and Al-Hakim said, \"Its chain is Sahih and they did not record it.\" Imam Ahmad recorded that Ibn `Abbas said, \"A sheep belonging to Sawdah bint Zam`ah died and she said, `O Allah's Messenger! So-and-so (sheep) has died.' He said,  «فَلِمَ لَا أَخَذْتُمْ مَسْكَهَا؟»  (Why did you not use its skin) She said, `Should we use the skin of a sheep that has died' Allah's Messenger ﷺ said,  «إِنَّمَا قَالَ اللهُ:  قُل لاَ أَجِدُ فِى مَآ أُوْحِىَ إِلَىَّ مُحَرَّمًا عَلَى طَاعِمٍ يَطْعَمُهُ إِلاَ أَن يَكُونَ مَيْتَةً أَوْ دَمًا مَّسْفُوحًا أَوْ لَحْمَ خِنزِيرٍ  وَإِنَّكُمْ لَا تَطْعَمُونَهُ أَنْ تَدْبَغُوهُ فَتَنْتَفِعُوا بِه»  (Allah only said, (Say: \"I find not in that which has been revealed to me anything forbidden to be eaten by one who wishes to eat it, except Maytah (a dead animal) or blood poured forth, or the flesh of swine....) You will not be eating it if you tan its skin and benefit from it.) So she had the sheep skinned, the skin was tanned and made into a water skin that she kept until it wore out.\" Al-Bukhari and an-Nasa'i collected a similar Hadith. Allah said,  فَمَنِ اضْطُرَّ غَيْرَ بَاغٍ وَلاَ عَادٍ  (But whosoever is forced by necessity without willful disobedience, nor transgressing due limits;) Therefore, whoever is forced by necessity to eat anything that Allah has forbidden in this honorable Ayah, without transgressing his limits, then for him,  فَإِنَّ رَبَّكَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ  (certainly, your Lord is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.) We mentioned the explanation of this Ayah in Surat Al-Baqarah. This honorable Ayah contradicts the idolators' innovated prohibitions for certain kinds of wealth, relying merely on their misguided ideas, such as the Bahirah, Sa'ibah, Wasilah and Ham. Allah commanded His Messenger to inform them that he does not find that such types of animals are prohibited in what Allah revealed to him. In this Ayah, Allah only prohibited dead animals, poured blood, the flesh of swine and what has been slaughtered for something other than Allah. Other things were not prohibited here, but rather treated as that which does not have a ruling, i.e., permissible. Therefore, how do you -- idolators -- claim that such items are prohibited, and why did you prohibit them when Allah did not prohibit them "
  6,146,"<h2>Foods that were Prohibited for the Jews Because of their Transgression</h2> Allah says, We forbade for the Jews every bird and animal with undivided hoof, such as the camel, ostrich, duck and goose. Allah said here,  وَمِنَ الْبَقَرِ وَالْغَنَمِ حَرَّمْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ شُحُومَهُمَآ  (and We forbade them the fat of the ox and the sheep...) The Jews used to forbid these types of foods saying that Isra'il, or Ya`qub, used to forbid them for himself so they too forbid them. This was mentioned by As-Suddi. `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas said that,  إِلاَّ مَا حَمَلَتْ ظُهُورُهُمَآ  (except what adheres to their backs) refers to the fat that clings to their backs. Allah said next,  أَوِ الْحَوَايَآ  (or their Hawaya) that is, the entrails, according to Abu Ja`far bin Jarir. He also said, \"The meaning here is, `And from ox and sheep, We forbade their fat for the Jews, except the fat on their backs and what the entrails carry.\" `Ali bin Abi Talhah said that, Ibn `Abbas said that the, Hawaya, are the entrails. Similar was reported from Mujahid, Sa`id bin Jubayr and Ad-Dahhak. Allah's statement,  أَوْ مَا اخْتَلَطَ بِعَظْمٍ  (....or is mixed up with a bone.) means, We allowed the Jews the fat that is mixed with bones. Ibn Jurayj commented, \"The fat on the rump that is mixed with the tailbone was allowed for them, and also the fat on the legs, head, eyes and what adheres to the bones.\" As-Suddi said similarly. Allah said,  ذَلِكَ جَزَيْنَـهُم بِبَغْيِهِمْ  (Thus We recompensed them for their rebellion.) meaning, We imposed this restriction on them as recompense for their rebellion and defying Our commandments. Allah said in another Ayah,  فَبِظُلْمٍ مِّنَ الَّذِينَ هَادُواْ حَرَّمْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ طَيِّبَـتٍ أُحِلَّتْ لَهُمْ وَبِصَدِّهِمْ عَن سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ كَثِيراً  (For the wrongdoing of the Jews, We made unlawful for them certain good foods which had been lawful for them -- and for their hindering many from Allah's way) 4:160. Allah's statement,  وِإِنَّا لَصَـدِقُونَ  (And verily, We are Truthful.) means, We were justified in the penalty We gave them. Ibn Jarir commented, \"We are Truthful in what We informed you of, O Muhammad; Our forbidding these foods for them, not as they claimed, that Israel merely forbade these things for himself (so they imitated him, they claimed).\" <h2>The Tricks of the Jews, and Allah's Curse</h2> `Abdullah bin `Abbas narrated, \"When `Umar bin Al-Khattab was told that Samurah sold liquor, he commented, `May Allah fight Samurah! Did he not know that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,  «لَعَنَ اللهُ الْيَهُودَ حُرِّمَتْ عَلَيْهِمُ الشُّحُومُ فَجَمَلُوهَا فَبَاعُوهَا»  (May Allah curse the Jews! The fats were forbidden for them, so they melted the fat and sold it.)\" This Hadith is recorded in the Two Sahihs. Jabir bin `Abdullah said, \"In the year of the victory of Makkah, I heard Allah's Messenger ﷺ saying;  «إِنَّ اللهَ وَرَسُولَهُ حَرَّمَ بَيْعَ الْخَمْرِ وَالْمَيْتَةِ وَالْخِنْزِيرِ وَالْأَصْنَام»  (Allah and His Messenger have forbidden selling alcoholic drinks (intoxicants), dead animals, swine and idols.) He was asked, `What about the fat of dead animals They are used to dye skins, paint ships and are used as light by the people.' He said,  «لَا هُوَ حَرَام»  (No, it is still unlawful.) He then said,  «قَاتَلَ اللهُ الْيَهُودَ إِنَّ اللهَ لَمَّا حَرَّمَ عَلَيْهِمْ شُحُومَهَا جَمَلُوهُ ثُمَّ بَاعُوهُ وَأَكَلُوا ثَمَنَه»  (May Allah fight the Jews! When Allah forbade them the fats of animals, they melted the fat, sold it and ate its price.)\" The Group recorded this Hadith. "
