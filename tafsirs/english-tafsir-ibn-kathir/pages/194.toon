tafsir[7]{c,v,t}:
  9,41,"<h2>Jihad is required in all Conditions</h2> Sufyan Ath-Thawri narrated from his father from Abu Ad-Duha, Muslim bin Subayh, who said, \"This Ayah,  انْفِرُواْ خِفَافًا وَثِقَالاً  (March forth, whether you are light or heavy) was the first part to be revealed from Surah Bara'ah.\" Mu`tamir bin Sulayman narrated that his father said, \"Hadrami claimed that he was told that some people used to declare that they will not gain sin (if they lag behind the forces of Jihad) because they are ill or old. This Ayah was revealed,  انْفِرُواْ خِفَافًا وَثِقَالاً  (March forth, whether you are light or heavy.)\" Allah commanded mass mobilization together with the Messenger of Allah ﷺ for the battle of Tabuk, to fight the disbelieving, People of the Book, the Romans, Allah's enemies. Allah ordained that the believers all march forth with the Messenger ﷺ regardless whether they felt active, lazy, at ease or had difficult circumstances,  انْفِرُواْ خِفَافًا وَثِقَالاً  (March forth, whether you are light or heavy) `Ali bin Zayd narrated that Anas said that Abu Talhah commented (on this Ayah), \"Whether you are old or young, Allah did not leave an excuse for anyone.\" Abu Talhah marched to Ash-Sham and fought until he was killed. In another narration, Abu Talhah recited Surah Bara'ah until he reached this Ayah,  انْفِرُواْ خِفَافًا وَثِقَالاً وَجَـهِدُواْ بِأَمْوَلِكُمْ وَأَنفُسِكُمْ فِى سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ  (March forth, whether you are light or heavy, and strive hard with your wealth and your lives in the cause of Allah.) He then said, \"I see that Allah had called us to mobilize whether we are old or young. O my children! Prepare my supplies.\" His children said, `May Allah grant you His mercy! You conducted Jihad along with the Messenger of Allah ﷺ until he died, then with Abu Bakr until he died, then with `Umar until he died. Let us perform Jihad in your place.\" Abu Talhah refused and he went to the sea under the command of Mu`awiyah where he died. They could not find an island to bury him on until nine days later, during which his body did not deteriorate or change and they buried him on the island. As-Suddi said,  انْفِرُواْ خِفَافًا وَثِقَالاً  (March forth, whether you are light or heavy), whether you are rich, poor, strong, or weak. A man came forward, and he was fat, complained, and asked for permission to stay behind from Jihad, but the Prophet refused. Then this Ayah,  انْفِرُواْ خِفَافًا وَثِقَالاً  (March forth, whether you are light or heavy) was revealed, and it became hard on the people. So Allah abrogated it with this Ayah,  لَّيْسَ عَلَى الضُّعَفَآءِ وَلاَ عَلَى الْمَرْضَى وَلاَ عَلَى الَّذِينَ لاَ يَجِدُونَ مَا يُنفِقُونَ حَرَجٌ إِذَا نَصَحُواْ لِلَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ  r(There is no blame on those who are weak or ill or who find no resources to spend, if they are sincere and true (in duty) to Allah and His Messenger) 9:91.\" Ibn Jarir said that Hibban bin Zayd Ash-Shar`abi narrated to him, \"We mobilized our forces with Safwan bin `Amr, who was the governor of Hims towards the city of Ephsos appointed to the Jerajima Christian expatriates (in Syria). I saw among the army an old, yet active man, whose eyebrows had sunk over his eyes (from old age), from the residents of Damascus, riding on his animal. I said to him, `O uncle! Allah has given you an excuse (to lag behind).' He said, `O my nephew! Allah has mobilized us whether we are light or heavy. Verily, those whom Allah loves, He tests them. Then to Allah is their return and eternal dwelling. Allah tests from His servants whoever thanks (Him) and observes patience and remembrance of Him, all the while worshipping Allah, the Exalted and Most Honored, and worshipping none else.\"' Next, Allah encourages spending in His cause and striving with one's life in His pleasure and the pleasure of His Messenger ,  وَجَـهِدُواْ بِأَمْوَلِكُمْ وَأَنفُسِكُمْ فِى سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ ذَلِكُمْ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ إِن كُنتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ  (and strive hard with your wealth and your lives in the cause of Allah. This is better for you, if you but knew.) Allah says, this is better for you in this life and the Hereafter. You might spend small amounts, but Allah will reward you the property of your enemy in this life, as well as, the honor that He will keep for you in the Hereafter. The Prophet said,  «تَكَفَّلَ اللهُ لِلْمُجَاهِدِ فِي سَبِيلِهِ إِنْ تَوَفَّاهُ أَنْ يُدْخِلَهُ الْجَنَّةَ، أَوْ يَرُدَّهُ إِلَى مَنْزِلِهِ بِمَا نَالَ مِنْ أَجْرٍ أَوْ غَنِيمَة»  (Allah promised the Mujahid in His cause that if He brings death to him, He will enter him into Paradise. Or, He will return him to his house with whatever reward and war spoils he earns.) So Allah said;  كُتِبَ عَلَيْكُمُ الْقِتَالُ وَهُوَ كُرْهٌ لَّكُمْ وَعَسَى أَن تَكْرَهُواْ شَيْئًا وَهُوَ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ وَعَسَى أَن تُحِبُّواْ شَيْئًا وَهُوَ شَرٌّ لَّكُمْ وَاللَّهُ يَعْلَمُ وَأَنتُمْ لاَ تَعْلَمُونَ  (Jihad is ordained for you (Muslims) though you dislike it, and it may be that you dislike a thing which is good for you and that you like a thing which is bad for you. Allah knows but you do not know.)2:216 Imam Ahmad recorded that Anas said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to a man,  «أَسْلِم»  (Embrace Islam,) but the man said, \"I dislike doing so.\" The Messenger ﷺ said,  «أَسْلِمْ وَإِنْ كُنْتَ كَارِهًا»  (Embrace Islam even if you dislike it).\" "
  9,42,"<h2>Why Hypocrites would not join in Jihad</h2> Allah admonishes those who lagged behind and did not join the Prophet for the battle of Tabuk, those who asked the Prophet for permission to remain behind, falsely pretending to have legitimate reasons to do so,  ﴾لَوْ كَانَ عَرَضًا قَرِيبًا﴿ (Had it been a near gain), booty right in front of them, according to Ibn `Abbas,  ﴾وَسَفَرًا قَاصِدًا﴿ (and an easy journey), travel for only a short distance,  ﴾لاَّتَّبَعُوكَ﴿ (they would have followed you.) But,  ﴾وَلَـكِن بَعُدَتْ عَلَيْهِمُ الشُّقَّةُ﴿ (the distance was long for them), to Ash-Sham,  ﴾وَسَيَحْلِفُونَ بِاللَّهِ﴿ (and they would swear by Allah), when you return to them,  ﴾لَوِ اسْتَطَعْنَا لَخَرَجْنَا مَعَكُمْ﴿ (If we only could, we would certainly have come forth with you), had not there been a valid excuse, we would have gone out with you,  ﴾يُهْلِكُونَ أَنفُسَهُمْ وَاللَّهُ يَعْلَمُ إِنَّهُمْ لَكَـذِبُونَ﴿ (They destroy themselves, and Allah knows that they are liars.)  "

  9,45,"<h2>Moderately criticizing the Prophet for allowing the Hypocrites to stay behind</h2> Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `Awn said, \"Have you heard criticism softer than this, starting with forgiveness before criticism,  عَفَا اللَّهُ عَنكَ لِمَ أَذِنتَ لَهُمْ  (May Allah forgive you. Why did you grant them leave...)\" Muwarriq Al-`Ijli and others said similarly. Qatadah said, \"Allah criticized him as you read here, then later revealed to him the permission to allow them to lag behind if he wants, in Surat An-Nur,  فَإِذَا اسْتَـْذَنُوكَ لِبَعْضِ شَأْنِهِمْ فَأْذَن لِّمَن شِئْتَ مِنْهُمْ  (So if they ask your permission for some affairs of theirs, give permission to whom you will of them) 24:62.\" `Ata' Al-Khurasani said similarly. Mujahid said, \"This Ayah was revealed about some people who said, `Ask permission from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ to stay behind, and whether he agrees, or disagrees, remain behind!\"' Allah said,  حَتَّى يَتَبَيَّنَ لَكَ الَّذِينَ صَدَقُواْ  (...until those who told the truth were manifest to you), in reference to valid excuses,  وَتَعْلَمَ الْكَـذِبِينَ  (and you had known the liars) Allah says, `Why did you not refuse to give them permission to remain behind when they asked you, so that you know those who truly obey you and the liars, who were intent on remaining behind even if you do not give them permission to do so, Allah asserts that none who believe in Allah and His Messenger seek his permission to remain behind from fighting,  لاَ يَسْتَأْذِنُكَ  (would not ask your leave), to stay behind from Jihad,  الَّذِينَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الاٌّخِرِ أَن يُجَـهِدُواْ بِأَمْوَلِهِمْ وَأَنفُسِهِمْ  (Those who believe in Allah and the Last Day, to be exempted from fighting with their properties and their lives.) because they consider Jihad an act of worship. This is why when Allah called them to perform Jihad, they obeyed and hasten to act in His obedience,  وَاللَّهُ عَلِيمٌ بِالْمُتَّقِينَإِنَّمَا يَسْتَأْذِنُكَ  (and Allah is the All-Knower of those who have Taqwa. Those who ask your leave), to remain behind, without a valid excuse,  الَّذِينَ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الاٌّخِرِ  (those who believe not in Allah and the Last Day), they do not hope for Allah's reward in the Hereafter for their good actions,  وَارْتَابَتْ قُلُوبُهُمْ  (and whose hearts are in doubt), about the validity of what you brought them,  فَهُمْ فِى رَيْبِهِمْ يَتَرَدَّدُونَ  (so in their doubts they waver.) They waver in doubt, taking one step forward and one step back. They do not have a firm stance in anything, for they are unsure and destroyed, neither belonging to these nor to those. Verily, those whom Allah misguides, will never find a way for themselves to guidance. "

  9,47,"<h2>Exposing Hypocrites</h2> Allah said,  وَلَوْ أَرَادُواْ الْخُرُوجَ  (And if they had intended to march out,), with you to participate in Jihad  لأَعَدُّواْ لَهُ عُدَّةً  (certainly, they would have made some preparation for it) they would have prepared for such task,  وَلَـكِن كَرِهَ اللَّهُ انبِعَاثَهُمْ  (but Allah was averse to their being sent forth) Allah hated that they should go with you,  فَثَبَّطَهُمْ  (so He made them lag behind, and stay away from Jihad,  وَقِيلَ اقْعُدُواْ مَعَ الْقَـعِدِينَ  (and it was said (to them): \"Sit you among those who sit (at home)\") as a part of what was decreed for them not that He legislated that they stay behind. Allah then explained why He disliked that they march with the believers, saying,  لَوْ خَرَجُواْ فِيكُم مَّا زَادُوكُمْ إِلاَّ خَبَالاً  (Had they marched out with you, they would have added to you nothing except disorder), because they are cowards and failures,  ولاّوْضَعُواْ خِلَـلَكُمْ يَبْغُونَكُمُ الْفِتْنَةَ  (and they would have hurried about in your midst sowing sedition among you) They would have rushed to spread false stories, hatred and discord among you,  وَفِيكُمْ سَمَّـعُونَ لَهُمْ  (and there are some among you who would have listened to them.) who would have obeyed them, given preference to their speech and words and asked them for advice, unaware of the true reality of these hypocrites. This might have caused corruption and great evil between the believers. Muhammad bin Ishaq said, \"Those who sought permission (from the Messenger to lag behind) included some of the chiefs, such as `Abdullah bin Ubayy bin Salul and Al-Jadd bin Qays, who were masters of their people. Allah also made them lag behind because He knew that if they went along with the Messenger ﷺ they would sow sedition in his army.\" There were some in the Prophet's army who liked these chiefs and were ready to obey them, because they considered them honorable,  وَفِيكُمْ سَمَّـعُونَ لَهُمْ  (and there are some among you who would have listened to them) 9:47. Allah next reminds of His perfect knowledge, saying,  وَاللَّهُ عَلِيمٌ بِالظَّـلِمينَ  (And Allah is the All-Knower of the wrongdoers.) Allah says that He knows what occurred, what will occur and if anything would have occurred, how it would occur, such as,  لَوْ خَرَجُواْ فِيكُم مَّا زَادُوكُمْ إِلاَّ خَبَالاً  (Had they marched out with you, they would have added to you nothing except disorder,) indicating what they would have done had they marched, even though they did not. Allah said in similar Ayat,  وَلَوْ رُدُّواْ لَعَـدُواْ لِمَا نُهُواْ عَنْهُ وَإِنَّهُمْ لَكَـذِبُونَ  (But if they were returned (to the world), they would certainly revert to that which they were forbidden. And indeed they are liars.) 6:28,  وَلَوْ عَلِمَ اللَّهُ فِيهِمْ خَيْرًا لأَسْمَعَهُمْ وَلَوْ أَسْمَعَهُمْ لَتَوَلَّواْ وَّهُم مُّعْرِضُونَ  (Had Allah known of any good in them, He would indeed have made them listen; and even if He had made them listen, they would but have turned away with aversion (to the truth)) 8:23, and,  وَلَوْ أَنَّا كَتَبْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ أَنِ اقْتُلُواْ أَنفُسَكُمْ أَوِ اخْرُجُواْ مِن دِيَـرِكُمْ مَّا فَعَلُوهُ إِلاَّ قَلِيلٌ مِّنْهُمْ وَلَوْ أَنَّهُمْ فَعَلُواْ مَا يُوعَظُونَ بِهِ لَكَانَ خَيْراً لَّهُمْ وَأَشَدَّ تَثْبِيتاً - وَإِذاً لاّتَيْنَـهُمْ مِّن لَّدُنَّـآ أَجْراً عَظِيماً - وَلَهَدَيْنَـهُمْ صِرَطاً مُّسْتَقِيماً  (And if We had ordered them (saying), \"Kill yourselves (the innocent ones kill the guilty ones) or leave your homes,\" very few of them would have done it; but if they had done what they were told, it would have been better for them, and would have strengthened their conviction. And indeed We would then have bestowed upon them a great reward from Ourselves. And indeed We would have guided them to the straight way) 4:66-68. "
