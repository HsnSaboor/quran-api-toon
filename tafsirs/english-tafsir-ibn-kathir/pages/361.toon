  25,14,"<h2>What the Disbelievers said about the Messenger , refutation of Their Words, and Their ultimate Destiny</h2> Allah tells us about the disbelievers' stubborn resistance to and rejection of the truth, with no proof or evidence for doing so. Their excuse was, as they said: ﴾مَا لِهَـذَا الرَّسُولِ يَأْكُلُ الطَّعَامَ﴿ (Why does this Messenger eat food,) meaning, `as we eat, and why does he need food as we need it' ﴾وَيَمْشِى فِى الاٌّسْوَاقِ﴿ (and walk about in the markets.) means, he walks around and goes there often seeking to trade and earn a living. ﴾لَوْلا أُنزِلَ إِلَيْهِ مَلَكٌ فَيَكُونَ مَعَهُ نَذِيراً﴿ (Why is not an angel sent down to him to be a warner with him) They were saying: why doesn't an angel come down to him from Allah, to be a witness that what he is claiming is true This is like when Fira`wn said: ﴾فَلَوْلاَ أُلْقِىَ عَلَيْهِ أَسْوِرَةٌ مِّن ذَهَبٍ أَوْ جَآءَ مَعَهُ الْمَلَـئِكَةُ مُقْتَرِنِينَ ﴿ (\"Why then are not golden bracelets bestowed on him, or angels sent along with him\") (43:53). These people had a similar mentality and said the same kind of thing. They said: ﴾أَوْ يُلْقَى إِلَيْهِ كَنْزٌ﴿ (Or (why) has not a treasure been granted to him) meaning, treasure that he could spend on his needs and wants. ﴾أَوْ تَكُونُ لَهُ جَنَّةٌ يَأْكُلُ مِنْهَا﴿ (or why has he not a garden whereof he may eat) meaning, a garden that would go with him wherever he went. All of this is easy for Allah, but He had a reason for not doing any of these things, and with Him is the perfect proof and argument. ﴾وَقَالَ الظَّـلِمُونَ إِن تَتَّبِعُونَ إِلاَّ رَجُلاً مَّسْحُوراً﴿ (And the wrongdoers say: \"You follow none but a man bewitched.\") Allah said: ﴾انْظُرْ كَيْفَ ضَرَبُواْ لَكَ الاٌّمْثَالَ فَضَلُّواْ﴿ (See how they coin similitudes for you, so they have gone astray,) meaning, they accused you and belied you when they said that you were a sorcerer or bewitched or crazy or a liar or a poet, but all of these are false ideas. Everyone who has the slightest understanding will recognize that they are lying. Allah says: ﴾فُضِّلُواْ﴿ (so they have gone astray) from the path of guidance. ﴾فَلاَ يَسْتَطِيعْونَ سَبِيلاً﴿ (and they cannot find a path.) Everyone who steps outside of the way of truth and guidance has gone astray, no matter what direction he takes, because the truth is one and its methodology is unified, parts of it confirming other parts. Then Allah tells His Prophet that if He willed, He could bestow on him in this world something far better than what they were saying. He said: ﴾تَبَارَكَ الَّذِى إِن شَآءَ جَعَلَ لَكَ خَيْراً مِّن ذلِكَ﴿ (Blessed be He Who, if He wills, will assign you better than (all) that...) Mujahid said, \"This means in this world.\" And he said: \"The Quraysh used to call every house that was made of stone a `palace', whether it was large or small.\" ﴾بَلْ كَذَّبُواْ بِالسَّاعَةِ﴿ (Nay, they deny the Hour,) means, they say this in stubborn disbelief, not because they are seeking insight and guidance, but because their disbelief in the Day of Resurrection makes them say what they say. ﴾وَأَعْتَدْنَا﴿ (And We have prepared) means, `We have made ready,' ﴾لِمَن كَذَّبَ بِالسَّاعَةِ سَعِيراً﴿ (for those who deny the Hour, a flaming Fire.) means, an unbearably hot and painful torment in the fire of Hell. ﴾إِذَا رَأَتْهُمْ﴿ (When it sees them) means, when Hell sees them, ﴾مِن مَّكَانِ بَعِيدٍ﴿ (from a far place,) means from the place of gathering (on the Day of Resurrection), ﴾سَمِعُواْ لَهَا تَغَيُّظاً وَزَفِيراً﴿ (they will hear its raging and its roaring.) means, (it will make those sounds) out of hatred towards them. This is like the Ayah, ﴾إِذَآ أُلْقُواْ فِيهَا سَمِعُواْ لَهَا شَهِيقًا وَهِىَ تَفُورُ تَكَادُ تَمَيَّزُ مِنَ الغَيْظِ﴿ (When they are cast therein, they will hear the (terrible) drawing in of its breath as it blazes forth. It almost bursts up with fury) (67:7-8), which means that parts of it almost separate from other parts because of its intense hatred towards those who disbelieved in Allah. Imam Abu Ja`far bin Jarir narrated that Ibn `Abbas said: \"A man will be dragged towards Hell, which will be expanding and contracting, and Ar-Rahman will say to it: `What is the matter with you' It will say: `He is seeking refuge from me.' So Allah will say, `Let My servant go.' Another man will be dragged towards Hell and he will say, `O Lord, I never expected this from You.' Allah will say, `What did you expect' The man will say, `I expected that Your mercy would be great enough to include me.' So Allah will say, `Let My servant go.' Another man will be dragged towards Hell, and Hell will bray at him like a donkey braying at barley. Then it will give a moan that will instill fear in everyone.\" Its chain of narrators is Sahih. ﴾سَمِعُواْ لَهَا تَغَيُّظاً وَزَفِيراً﴿ (they will hear its raging and its roaring. ) `Abdur-Razzaq recorded that `Ubayd bin `Umayr said: \"Hell will utter a moan such that there will be no angel who is close to Allah and no Prophet sent to mankind, but he will fall on his face, shaking all over. Even Ibrahim, peace be upon him, will fall to his knees and say: `O Lord, I do not ask You for salvation this Day except for myself.\"' ﴾وَإَذَآ أُلْقُواْ مِنْهَا مَكَاناً ضَيِّقاً مُّقَرَّنِينَ﴿ (And when they shall be thrown into a narrow place thereof, chained together,) Qatadah narrated from Abu Ayyub that `Abdullah bin `Amr said: \"Like the point of a spear, i.e., in its narrowness.\" ﴾مُقْرِنِينَ﴿ (chained together,) Abu Salih said, \"This means, tied from their shoulders.\" ﴾دَعَوْاْ هُنَالِكَ ثُبُوراً﴿ (they will exclaim therein for destruction.) means, they will utter cries of woe, regret and sorrow. ﴾لاَّ تَدْعُواْ الْيَوْمَ ثُبُوراً وَحِداً﴿ (Exclaim not today for one destruction...) "

  25,16,"<h2>Is the Fire better, or Paradise</h2> Here Allah says: `O Muhammad, this that We have described to you about the state of those who are doomed, who will be dragged on their faces to Hell, which will receive them with a scowling face, with hatred and moans. There they will be thrown into their constricted spaces, tied up to their shoulders, unable to move or call for help, and unable to escape their plight --- is this better, or the eternal Paradise which Allah has promised to the pious among His servants, which He has prepared for them as a reward and ultimate destiny in return for their obedience to Him in this world' ﴾لَّهُمْ فِيهَا مَا يَشَآءُونَ﴿ (For them there will be therein all that they desire,) of delights such as food, drink, clothing, dwellings, means of transportation and scenery, and other things that no eye has seen, no ear has heard, nor the heart of anyone can comprehend. They will abide therein forever; it will never cease or come to an end, and they will never leave it. This is what Allah has promised to those whom He has blessed and to whom He has shown His favor. He says: ﴾كَانَ عَلَى رَبِّكَ وَعْداً مَّسْئُولاً﴿ (It is a upon your Lord a Wa`dan Mas'ula) meaning, it must inevitably come to pass. Abu Ja`far bin Jarir reported from some of the scholars of the Arabic language that the words ﴾وَعْداً مَّسْئُولاً﴿ (Wa`dan Mas'ula) mean: a binding pledge. In this Surah Allah mentions Hell, then refers to the situation of the people of Paradise. This is similar to the passage in Surat As-Saffat where Allah mentions the status of the people of Paradise, with its beauty and joy, then He says: ﴾أَذَلِكَ خَيْرٌ نُّزُلاً أَمْ شَجَرَةُ الزَّقُّومِ - إِنَّا جَعَلْنَـهَا فِتْنَةً لِّلظَّـلِمِينَ - إِنَّهَا شَجَرَةٌ تَخْرُجُ فِى أَصْلِ الْجَحِيمِ - طَلْعُهَا كَأَنَّهُ رُءُوسُ الشَّيَـطِينِ - فَإِنَّهُمْ لاّكِلُونَ مِنْهَا فَمَالِئُونَ مِنْهَا الْبُطُونَ - ثُمَّ إِنَّ لَهُمْ عَلَيْهَا لَشَوْباً مِنْ حَمِيمٍ - ثُمَّ إِنَّ مَرْجِعَهُمْ لإِلَى الْجَحِيمِ - إِنَّهُمْ أَلْفَوْاْ ءَابَآءَهُمْ ضَآلِّينَ - فَهُمْ عَلَى ءَاثَارِهِمْ يُهْرَعُونَ ﴿ :(Is that better entertainment or the tree of Zaqqum Truly, We have made it a trial for the wrongdoers. Verily, it is a tree that springs out of the bottom of Hellfire, The shoots of its fruit stalks are like the heads of Shayatin. Truly, they will eat thereof and fill their bellies therewith. Then on the top of that they will be given boiling water to drink so that it becomes a mixture. Then thereafter, verily, their return is to the flaming fire of Hell. Verily, they found their fathers on the wrong path. So they hastened in their footsteps!) (37:62-70) "

  25,19,"<h2>The gods of the Idolators will disown Them on the Day of Resurrection</h2> Allah tells us about what will happen on the Day of Resurrection, when those whom the idolators used to worship instead of Allah, angels and others, will rebuke them. Allah says: ﴾وَيَوْمَ يَحْشُرُهُمْ وَمَا يَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ﴿ (And on the Day when He will gather them together and that which they worship besides Allah.) Mujahid said, \"This means `Isa, `Uzayr and the angels.\" ﴾فَيَقُولُ أَءَنتُمْ أَضْلَلْتُمْ عِبَادِى هَـؤُلاَءِ﴿ (He will say: \"Was it you who misled these My servants...\") Allah will say to those who were worshipped: `Did you call these people to worship you instead of Me, or was it their own idea to worship you, without any call to that on your part' This is like the Ayah, ﴾وَإِذْ قَالَ اللَّهُ يعِيسَى ابْنَ مَرْيَمَ أَءَنتَ قُلتَ لِلنَّاسِ اتَّخِذُونِى وَأُمِّىَ إِلَـهَيْنِ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ قَالَ سُبْحَـنَكَ مَا يَكُونُ لِى أَنْ أَقُولَ مَا لَيْسَ لِى بِحَقٍّ إِن كُنتُ قُلْتُهُ فَقَدْ عَلِمْتَهُ تَعْلَمُ مَا فِى نَفْسِى وَلاَ أَعْلَمُ مَا فِى نَفْسِكَ إِنَّكَ أَنتَ عَلَّـمُ الْغُيُوبِ مَا قُلْتُ لَهُمْ إِلاَّ مَآ أَمَرْتَنِى بِهِ﴿ (And when Allah will say: \"O `Isa, son of Maryam! Did you say unto men: `Worship me and my mother as two gods besides Allah' \" He will say: \"Glory be to You! It was not for me to say what I had no right (to say). Had I said such a thing, You would surely have known it. You know what is in my innerself though I do not know what is in Yours; truly, You, only You, are the All-Knower of all that is hidden. Never did I say to them aught except what You did command me to say.\") (5:116-117) Describing how those who were worshipped will respond on the Day of Resurrection, Allah says: ﴾قَالُواْ سُبْحَـنَكَ مَا كَانَ يَنبَغِى لَنَآ أَن نَّتَّخِذَ مِن دُونِكَ مِنْ أَوْلِيَآءَ﴿ (They will say: \"Glorified be You! It was not for us to take (Nattakhidh) any Awliya' besides You...\") Most of the scholars recite a Fathah on the Nun of the word Nattakhidh in His saying: ﴾نَّتَّخِذَ مِن دُونِكَ مِنْ أَوْلِيَآءَ﴿ (\"...for us to take (Nattakhidh) any Awliya' besides You,\") meaning, `it is not right for any created being, neither us nor them, to worship anyone except You; we did not call them to do that, but they did it of their own accord, without us telling them to do it or accepting what they did. We are innocent of them and their worship.' This is like the Ayah, ﴾وَيَوْمَ يَحْشُرُهُمْ جَمِيعاً ثُمَّ يَقُولُ لِلْمَلَـئِكَةِ أَهَـؤُلاَءِ إِيَّاكُمْ كَانُواْ يَعْبُدُونَ قَالُواْ سُبْحَـنَكَ﴿ (And (remember) the Day when He will gather them all together, then He will say to the angels: \"Was it you that these people used to worship\" They (the angels) will say: \"Glorified be You!\") (34:40-41) Other scholars understand this phrase to mean: `it is not proper for us to take anyone except You as protectors or helpers (Awliya'), ' meaning, `it is not proper for anyone to worship us, for we are Your servants and in need of You.' This meaning is close to the first. ﴾وَلَـكِن مَّتَّعْتَهُمْ وَءَابَآءَهُمْ﴿ (but You gave them and their fathers comfort) means, `You made such a long period of time pass that they forgot the Reminder, i.e., they forgot what had been sent down to them through the Messengers, calling them to worship You alone with no partner or associate.' ﴾وَكَانُواْ قَوْماً بُوراً﴿ (and became a lost people.) Ibn `Abbas said, \"This means, they were destroyed.\" Al-Hasan Al-Basri and Malik narrated from Az-Zuhri: \"There was no good in them.\" And Allah says: ﴾فَقَدْ كَذَّبُوكُمْ بِمَا تَقُولُونَ﴿ (Thus they will deny you because of what you say;) meaning, `those whom you used to worship besides Allah will show you to be liars in your claims that they were your helpers and protectors bringing you closer to Allah.' This is like the Ayat: ﴾وَمَنْ أَضَلُّ مِمَّن يَدْعُو مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ مَن لاَّ يَسْتَجِيبُ لَهُ إِلَى يَوْمِ الْقِيَـمَةِ وَهُمْ عَن دُعَآئِهِمْ غَـفِلُونَ - وَإِذَا حُشِرَ النَّاسُ كَانُواْ لَهُمْ أَعْدَآءً وَكَانُواْ بِعِبَادَتِهِمْ كَـفِرِينَ ﴿ (And who is more astray than one who calls on besides Allah, such as will not answer him till the Day of Resurrection, and who are unaware of their calls to them. And when mankind are gathered, they will become their enemies and will deny their worshipping.) (46:5-6) ﴾فَمَا تَسْتَطِيعُونَ صَرْفاً وَلاَ نَصْراً﴿ (then you can neither avert nor find help.) means: they will not be able to avert the punishment from themselves, nor will they be able to help themselves. ﴾وَمَن يَظْلِم مِّنكُمْ﴿ (And whoever among you does wrong,) means by associating others in worship with Allah, ﴾نُذِقْهُ عَذَاباً كَبِيراً﴿ (We shall make him taste a great torment.) "
  25,20," فَمَا تَسْتَطِيعُونَ صَرْفاً وَلاَ نَصْراً  (then you can neither avert nor find help.) means: they will not be able to avert the punishment from themselves, nor will they be able to help themselves.  وَمَن يَظْلِم مِّنكُمْ  (And whoever among you does wrong,) means by associating others in worship with Allah,  نُذِقْهُ عَذَاباً كَبِيراً  (We shall make him taste a great torment.)  وَمَآ أَرْسَلْنَا قَبْلَكَ مِنَ الْمُرْسَلِينَ إِلاَّ إِنَّهُمْ لَيَأْكُلُونَ الطَّعَامَ وَيَمْشُونَ فِى الاٌّسْوَاقِ وَجَعَلْنَا بَعْضَكُمْ لِبَعْضٍ فِتْنَةً أَتَصْبِرُونَ وَكَانَ رَبُّكَ بَصِيراً  (20. And We never sent before you any of the Messengers but verily, they ate food and walked in the markets. And We have made some of you as a trial for others; will you have patience And your Lord is Ever All-Seer.) <h2>All of the Previous Messengers were Human</h2> Allah tells us about the previous Messengers He sent: they all used to eat food needing the nourishment in it. They used to go around in the marketplaces seeking to engage in trade and earn a livelihood. This should not, however, affect their status as Messengers, for Allah gave them good characteristics and caused them to speak fine words and do noble deeds, and gave them miracles and clear proofs, from which any person with sound insight may see the confirmation that what they brought from Allah was true. This Ayah is similar to the Ayat;  وَمَآ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ إِلاَّ رِجَالاً نُّوحِى إِلَيْهِمْ مِّنْ أَهْلِ الْقُرَى  (And We sent not before you any but men unto whom We revealed, from among the people of townships) (12:109).  وَمَا جَعَلْنَـهُمْ جَسَداً لاَّ يَأْكُلُونَ الطَّعَامَ  (And We did not create them bodies that ate not food) (21:8).  وَجَعَلْنَا بَعْضَكُمْ لِبَعْضٍ فِتْنَةً أَتَصْبِرُونَ  (And We have made some of you as a trial for others; will you have patience) means, `We test some of you by means of others, so that We may see who will be obedient and who will be disobedient.' Allah says:  أَتَصْبِرُونَ وَكَانَ رَبُّكَ بَصِيراً  (will you have patience And your Lord is Ever All-Seer.) meaning, He knows who deserves to receive revelation, as Allah says elsewhere:  اللَّهُ أَعْلَمُ حَيْثُ يَجْعَلُ رِسَالَتَهُ  (Allah knows best with whom to place His Message) (6:124). And He knows who deserves to be guided to the Message with which He sent them, and who does not deserve to be guided.  وَجَعَلْنَا بَعْضَكُمْ لِبَعْضٍ فِتْنَةً أَتَصْبِرُونَ  (And We have made some of you as a trial for others. Will you have patience) Muhammad bin Ishaq said: Allah is saying, \"If I had willed that the world be such that no one would oppose My Messengers, I could have made it so, but I wanted to test My servants by means of them.\" In Sahih Muslim it is narrated from `Iyad bin Himar that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:  «يَقُولُ اللهُ تَعَالى: إِنِّي مُبْتَلِيكَ وَمُبْتَلٍ بِك»  (Allah says: \"I will test you and test others by means of you.\") In the Sahih it is recorded that he was given the choice between being a Prophet and king, or being a servant and Messenger, and he chose to be a servant and Messenger.
