  4,28,"﴾وَيَهْدِيَكُمْ سُنَنَ الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِكُمْ﴿ (And to show you the ways of those before you,) meaning their righteous ways and how to adhere to the commandments that He likes and is pleased with. ﴾وَيَتُوبَ عَلَيْكُمْ﴿ (and accept your repentance) from sin and error, ﴾وَاللَّهُ عَلِيمٌ حَكِيمٌ﴿ (and Allah is All-Knower, All-Wise.) in His commands, decrees, actions and statements. Allah's statement, ﴾وَيُرِيدُ الَّذِينَ يَتَّبِعُونَ الشَّهَوَتِ أَن تَمِيلُواْ مَيْلاً عَظِيماً﴿ (but those who follow their lusts, wish that you (believers) should deviate tremendously away from the right path)) indicates that the followers of Shaytan among the Jews, Christians and the adulterous, wish that you would take the horrendous path of falsehood instead of the truth. ﴾يُرِيدُ اللَّهُ أَن يُخَفِّفَ عَنْكُمْ﴿ (Allah wishes to lighten (the burden) for you\") His legislation, orders, what He prohibits and what He decrees for you. This is why Allah has allowed free men to marry slave girls under certain conditions, as Mujahid and others have stated. ﴾وَخُلِقَ الإِنسَـنُ ضَعِيفاً﴿ (and man was created weak.) and this is why it is suitable in his case that the commands are made easy for him, because of his weakness and feebleness. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Tawus said that, ﴾وَخُلِقَ الإِنسَـنُ ضَعِيفاً﴿ (and man was created weak), \"Concerning women\". Waki` said, \"Man's mind leaves when women are involved.\" "

  4,31,"<h2>Prohibiting Unlawfully Earned Money</h2> Allah, the Exalted and Most Honored, prohibits His believing servants from illegally acquiring each other's property using various dishonest methods such as Riba, gambling and other wicked methods that appear to be legal, but Allah knows that, in reality, those involved seek to deal in interest. Ibn Jarir recorded that Ibn `Abbas commented on a man who buys a garment, saying that if he likes it he will keep it, or he will return it along with an extra Dirham, \"This is what Allah meant, when He said, o  وَلاَ تَأْكُلُواْ أَمْوَلَكُمْ بَيْنَكُم بِالْبَاطِلِ  (Eat not up your property among yourselves unjustly.\") `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas said, \"When Allah sent down,  يَـأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ لاَ تَأْكُلُواْ أَمْوَلَكُمْ بَيْنَكُمْ بِالْبَـطِلِ  (O you who believe! Eat not up your property among yourselves unjustly) some Muslims said, `Allah has forbidden us from eating up each other's property unjustly, and food is our best property. Therefore, none among us is allowed to eat from anyone else's food.' After that Allah sent down,  لَّيْسَ عَلَى الاٌّعْمَى حَرَجٌ  (There is no restriction on the blind) (until the end of the Ayah). 24:61.\"' Qatadah said similarly. Allah's statement,  إِلاَّ أَن تَكُونَ تِجَـرَةً عَن تَرَاضٍ مِّنْكُمْ  (except it be a trade amongst you, by mutual consent.) means, do not revert to illegal ways and means to acquire money. However, there is no harm in commercial transactions that transpire between the buyer and the seller with mutual consent, so that money is legally earned from these transactions. Mujahid said that,  إِلاَّ أَن تَكُونَ تِجَـرَةً عَن تَرَاضٍ مِّنْكُمْ  (except it be a trade amongst you, by mutual consent.) means, \"By selling and buying, or giving someone a gift.\" Ibn Jarir recorded this statement. <h2>The Option to Buy or Sell Before Parting, is Part of `Mutual Consent' in Trading</h2> Mutual agreement in various transactions is attained when both parties have the right to uphold or dissolve the agreement before they part. In the Two Sahihs, it is recorded that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,  «الْبَيِّعَانِ بِالْخِيَارِ مَالَمْ يَتَفَرَّقَا»  (The seller and the buyer retain the (right to change their mind) as long as they have not parted.) Al-Bukhari's wording for this Hadith reads,  «إِذَا تَبَايَعَ الرَّجُلانِ فَكُلُّ وَاحِدٍ مِنْهُمَا بِالْخِيَارِ، مَالَمْ يَتَفَرَّقَا»  (When two men conduct a transaction, they retain their (right to change their mind) as long as they have not parted.) <h2>Forbidding Murder and Suicide</h2> Allah said,  وَلاَ تَقْتُلُواْ أَنفُسَكُمْ  (And do not kill yourselves.) by committing Allah's prohibitions, falling into sin and eating up each other's property unjustly,  إِنَّ اللَّهَ كَانَ بِكُمْ رَحِيماً  (Surely, Allah is Most Merciful to you.) in what He commanded you and prohibited you from. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Amr bin Al-`As said that when the Prophet sent him for the battle of Dhat As-Salasil, \"I had a wet dream during a very cold night and feared that if I bathed, I would die. So I performed Tayammum (with pure earth) and led my company in the Dawn prayer. When I went back to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, I mentioned what had happened to me and he said,  «يَا عَمْرُو صَلَّيْتَ بِأَصْحَابِكَ وَأَنْتَ جُنُب»  (O `Amr! Have you led your people in prayer while you were in a state of sexual impurity) I said, 'O Messenger of Allah! I had a wet dream on a very cold night and feared that if I bathed I would perish, and I remembered Allah's statement,  وَلاَ تَقْتُلُواْ أَنفُسَكُمْ إِنَّ اللَّهَ كَانَ بِكُمْ رَحِيماً  (And do not kill yourselves. Surely, Allah is Most Merciful to you). So I performed Tayammum and prayed.' The Messenger of Allah ﷺ smiled and did not say anything.\" This is the narration reported by Abu Dawud. Ibn Marduwyah mentioned this honorable Ayah and then reported that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,  «مَنْ قَتَلَ نَفْسَهُ بَحَدِيدَةٍ، فَحَدِيدَتُهُ فِي يَدِهِ، يَجَأُ بِهَا بطْنَهُ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ فِي نَارِ جَهَنَّمَ، خَالِدًا مُخَلَّدًا فِيهَا أَبَدًا، ومَنْ قَتَلَ نَفْسَهُ بِسُمَ فَسُمُّهُ فِي يَدِهِ، يَتَحَسَّاهُ فِي نَارِ جَهَنَّمَ، خَالِدًا مُخَلَّدًا فِيهَا أَبَدًا، وَمَنْ تَرَدَّى مِنْ جَبَلٍ فَقَتلَ نَفْسَهُ، فَهُوَ مُتَرَدَ فِي نَارِ جَهَنَّمَ، خَالِدًا مُخَلَّدًا فِيهَا أَبَدًا»  (Whoever kills himself with an iron tool, then his tool will be in his hand and he will keep stabbing himself with it in the Fire of Jahannam, forever and ever. Whoever kills himself with poison, then his poison will be in his hand and he will keep taking it in the Fire of Jahannam forever and ever. Whoever kills himself by throwing himself from a mountain, will keep falling in the Fire of Jahannam forever and ever.) This Hadith was also collected in the Two Sahihs. Abu Qilabah said that Thabit bin Ad-Dahhak said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,  «مَنْ قَتَلَ نَفْسَهُ بِشَيْءٍ، عُذِّبَ بِهِ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَة»  (Whoever kills himself with an instrument, will be punished with it on the Day of Resurrection.) This Hadith was collected by the Group. This is why Allah said,  وَمَن يَفْعَلْ ذلِكَ عُدْوَناً وَظُلْماً  (And whoever commits that through aggression and injustice, ) meaning, whoever commits what Allah has forbidden for him transgression and injustice - while knowing that it is forbidden for him, yet he still dares to commit it,  فَسَوْفَ نُصْلِيهِ نَاراً  (We shall cast him into the Fire,). This Ayah carries a stern warning and a truthful promise. Therefore, every sane person should beware of it, those who hear the speech with full comprehension. <h2>Minor Sins Will be Pardoned if One Refrains from Major Sins</h2> Allah said,  إِن تَجْتَنِبُواْ كَبَآئِرَ مَا تُنهَوْنَ عَنْهُ نُكَفِّرْ عَنْكُمْ سَيِّئَـتِكُمْ  (If you avoid the great sins which you are forbidden to do, We shall remit from you your (small) sins,) meaning, if you avoid the major evil deeds that you were prohibited We will forgive you the minor evil deeds and will admit you into Paradise. This is why Allah said,  وَنُدْخِلْكُمْ مُّدْخَلاً كَرِيماً  (and admit you to a Noble Entrance (i.e. Paradise).) There are several Hadiths on the subject of this honorable Ayah. Imam Ahmad recorded that Salman Al-Farisi said, \"The Prophet said to me, `Do you know what the day of Al-Jumu`ah is' I said, `It is the day during which Allah brought together the creation of your father (Adam).' He said,  «لكِنْ أَدْرِي مَا يَوْمُ الْجُمُعَةِ، لَا يَتَطَهَّرُ الرَّجُلُ فَيُحْسِنُ طُهُورَهُ، ثُمَّ يَأْتِي الْجُمُعَةَ فَيُنْصِتُ حَتَّى يَقْضِيَ الْإمَامُ صَلَاتَهُ، إِلَّا كَانَ كَفَّارَةً لَهُ مَا بَيْنَهُ وَبَيْنَ الْجُمُعَةِ الْمُقْبِلَةِ، مَا اجْتُنِبَتِ الْمَقْتَلَة»  (I know what the day of Jumu`ah is. Anyone who takes a bath and cleans himself as much as he can and then proceeds for the Friday prayer and remains quiet until the Imam finishes the prayer, all his sins in between the present and the next Friday will be forgiven, as long as major sins were avoided.)\" Al-Bukhari recorded similar wording from Salman Al-Farisi. <h2>The Seven Destructive Sins</h2> What are the Seven Destructive Sins In the Two Sahihs, it is recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,  «اجْتَنِبُوا السَّبْعَ الْمُوبِقَات»  (Avoid the seven great destructive sins.) The people inquired, 'O Allah's Messenger! What are they' He said,  «الشِّرْكُ بِاللهِ، وَقَتْلُ النَّفْسِ الَّتِي حَرَّمَ اللهُ إِلَّا بِالْحَقِّ، وَالسِّحْرُ، وَأَكْلُ الرِّبَا، وَأَكْلُ مَالِ الْيَتِيمِ، وَالتَّوَلِّي يَوْمَ الزَّحْفِ، وَقَذْفُ الْمُحْصَنَاتِ الْمُؤْمِنَاتِ الْغَافِلَات»  (To join others in worship along with Allah, to kill the life which Allah has forbidden except for a just cause, magic, to consume Riba, to consume an orphan's wealth, to turn away from the enemy and flee from the battlefield when the battle begins, and to accuse chaste women, who never even think of anything that would tarnish their chastity and are good believers.) Another Hadith that mentions False Witness Imam Ahmad recorded that Anas bin Malik said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ mentioned the major sins, or was asked about the major sins. He said,  «الشِّرْكُ بِاللهِ، وَقَتْلُ النَّفْسِ، وَعُقُوقُ الْوَالِدَيْن»  (Associating others with Allah in worship, killing the life, and being undutiful to the parents.) He then said,  «أَلَا أُنَبِّئُكُمْ بِأَكْبَرِ الْكَبَائِرِ؟»  قال:  «قَوْلُ الزُّورِ أَوْ شَهَادَةُ الزُّورِ »  (Should I tell you about the biggest of the major sins The false statement - or the false testimony.)\" Shu`bah - one of the narrators of the Hadith - said, \"Most likely, in my opinion, he said, `False testimony.\"' The Two Sahihs recorded this Hadith from Shu`bah from Anas. Another Hadith In the Two Sahihs, it is recorded that `Abdur-Rahman bin Abi Bakrah said that his father said, \"The Prophet said,  «أَلَا أُنَبِّئُكُمْ بِأَكْبَرِ الْكَبَائِرِ؟»  (Should I inform you about the greatest of the great sins) We said, `Yes, O Allah's Messenger !' He said,  «الِإشْرَاكُ بِاللهِ، وَعُقُوقُ الْوَالِدَيْن»  (To join others in worship with Allah and to be undutiful to one's parents.) He was reclining, then he sat up and said;  «أَلَا وَشَهَادَةُ الزُّورِ، أَلَا وَقَوْلُ الزُّور»  (And I warn you against false testimony and false speech.) and he continued repeating it until we wished that he would stop.\" Another Hadith that mentions killing the Offspring In the Two Sahihs, it is recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"I asked, `O Allah's Messenger! What is the greatest sin' (in one narration) the biggest sin' He said,  «أَنْ تَجْعَلَ للهِ نِدًّا وَهُوَ خَلَقَك»  (To make a rival for Allah while He Alone created you.) I said, `Then' He said,  «أَنْ تَقْتُلَ وَلَدَكَ خَشْيَةَ أَنْ يَطْعَمَ مَعَك»  (To kill your offspring for fear that he might share your food with you. ) I said, `Then' He said,  «أَنْ تُزَانِيَ حَلِيلَةَ جَارِك»  (To commit adultery with your neighbor's wife.) He then recited,  وَالَّذِينَ لاَ يَدْعُونَ مَعَ اللَّهِ إِلَـهَا ءَاخَرَ  (And those who invoke not any other god along with Allah), until,  إِلاَّ مَن تَابَ  (Except those who repent).\" Another Hadith from `Abdullah bin `Amr Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin `Amr said that the Prophet said,  «أَكْبَرُ الْكَبَائِرِ: الِإشْرَاكُ بِاللهِ، وَعُقُوقُ الْوَالِدَيْنِ أَوْ قَتْلُ النَّفْسِ شعبة الشاك وَالْيَمِينُ الْغَمُوس»  (The greatest sins are: To join others in worship with Allah, to be undutiful to one's parents - or to take a life) Shu`bah was uncertain of which one - (and the false oath). Recorded by Al-Bukhari, At-Tirmidhi, and An-Nasai. Another Hadith by `Abdullah bin `Amr about Causing one's Parents to be Cursed `Abdullah bin `Amr said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,  «إِنَّ مِنْ أَكْبَرِ الْكَبَائِرِ أَنْ يَلْعَنَ الرَّجُلُ وَالِدَيْه»  (Among the worst of the major sins is for a man to curse his own parents.) They said, \"How can one curse his own parents\" He said,  «يَسُبُّ الرَّجُلُ أَبَا الرَّجُلِ، فَيَسُبُّ أَبَاهُ، وَيَسُبُّ أُمَّهُ فَيَسُبُّ أُمَّه»  (One curses another man's father, and that man curses his father in retaliation, or he curses someone's mother and that man curses his mother.) This is the wording of Muslim. At-Tirmidhi said, \"Sahih.\" It is recorded in the Sahih that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,  «سِبَابُ الْمُسْلِمِ فُسُوقٌ، وَقِتَالُهُ كُفْر»  (Cursing a Muslim is a sin and fighting him is Kufr.) "
  4,32,"<h2>Do Not Wish for the Things Which Allah has Made Some Others to Excel In</h2> Imam Ahmad recorded that Umm Salamah said, \"O Messenger of Allah! Men go to battle, but we do not go to battle, and we earn one-half of the inheritance (that men get).\" Allah sent down, ﴾وَلاَ تَتَمَنَّوْاْ مَا فَضَّلَ اللَّهُ بِهِ بَعْضَكُمْ عَلَى بَعْضٍ﴿ (And wish not for the things in which Allah has made some of you to excel others). At-Tirmidhi also recorded this Hadith. Allah's statement, ﴾لِّلرِّجَالِ نَصِيبٌ مِّمَّا اكْتَسَبُواْ وَلِلنِّسَآءِ نَصِيبٌ مِّمَّا اكْتَسَبْنَ﴿ (For men there is reward for what they have earned, (and likewise) for women there is reward for what they have earned,) indicates, according to Ibn Jarir, that each person will earn his wages for his works, a reward if his deeds are good, and punishment if his deeds are evil. It was also reported that this Ayah is talking about inheritance, indicating the fact that each person will get his due share of the inheritance, as Al-Walibi reported from Ibn `Abbas. Allah then directed the servants to what benefits them, ﴾وَاسْأَلُواْ اللَّهَ مِن فَضْلِهِ﴿ (and ask Allah of His Bounty.)Therefore, the Ayah states, \"Do not wish for what other people were endowed with over you, for this is a decision that will come to pass, and wishing does not change its decree. However, ask Me of My favor and I will grant it to you, for I Am Most Generous and Most Giving.\" Allah then said, ﴾إِنَّ اللَّهَ كَانَ بِكُلِّ شَىْءٍ عَلِيماً﴿ (Surely, Allah is Ever All-Knower of everything.) meaning, Allah knows who deserves this life, and so He gives him riches, and whoever deserves poverty, He makes him poor. He also knows who deserves the Hereafter, and He directs him to perform the deeds that will help him to be sucessful in it, and whoever deserves failure, He prevents him from achieving righteousness and what leads to it. Hence, Allah said, m ﴾إِنَّ اللَّهَ كَانَ بِكُلِّ شَىْءٍ عَلِيماً﴿ (Surely, Allah is Ever All-Knower of everything). "
  4,33,"﴾وَلِكُلٍّ جَعَلْنَا مَوَالِىَ﴿ (And to everyone, We have appointed Mawali) means, \"Heirs.\" Ibn `Abbas was also reported to have said that Mawali refers to relatives. Ibn Jarir commented, \"The Arabs call the cousin a Mawla.\" Ibn Jarir continued, \"Allah's statement, ﴾مِّمَّا تَرَكَ الْوَلِدَنِ وَالاٌّقْرَبُونَ﴿ (of that (property) left by parents and relatives.) means, from what he inherited from his parents and family members. Therefore, the meaning of the Ayah becomes: `To all of you, O people, We appointed relatives (such as children) who will later inherit what you inherited from your own parents and relatives.\" Allah's statement, ﴾وَالَّذِينَ عَقَدَتْ أَيْمَـنُكُمْ فَـَاتُوهُمْ نَصِيبَهُمْ﴿ (To those also with whom you have made a pledge (brotherhood), give them their due portion.) means, \"Those with whom you have a pledge of brotherhood, give them their share of inheritance, thus fulfilling the ratified pledges that you gave them. Allah has witnessed all of you when you gave these pledges and promises.\" This practice was followed in the beginning of Islam, but was later on abrogated when Muslims were commanded to fulfill the pledges (brotherhood) they had already given, but to refrain from making any new pledges after that. Al-Bukhari recorded that Ibn `Abbas said, ﴾وَلِكُلٍّ جَعَلْنَا مَوَالِىَ﴿ (And to everyone, We have appointed Mawali) \"meaning, heirs; ﴾وَالَّذِينَ عَقَدَتْ أَيْمَـنُكُمْ﴿ (To those also with whom you have made a pledge (brotherhood)) When the emigrants came to Al-Madinah, the emigrant would inherit from the Ansari, while the latter's relatives would not inherit from him because of the bond of brotherhood which the Prophet established between them (the emigrants and the Ansar). When the verse, ﴾وَلِكُلٍّ جَعَلْنَا مَوَالِىَ﴿ (And to everyone We have appointed Mawali) was revealed, it cancelled (the pledge of brotherhood regarding inheritance).\" Then he said, \"The verse, ﴾وَالَّذِينَ عَقَدَتْ أَيْمَـنُكُمْ فَـَاتُوهُمْ نَصِيبَهُمْ﴿ (To those also with whom you have made a pledge (brotherhood), give them their due portion.) remained valid for cases of co-operation and mutual advice, while the matter of inheritance was excluded and it became permissible to assign something in one's will to the person who had the right of inheriting before.\" "
