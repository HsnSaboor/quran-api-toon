  55,45,"<h2>The Horrors of the Day of Resurrection</h2> Allah said, ﴾فَإِذَا انشَقَّتِ السَّمَآءُ﴿ (Then when the heaven is rent asunder,) on the Day of Resurrection; this meaning is clear in this and similar Ayat, such as, ﴾وَانشَقَّتِ السَّمَآءُ فَهِىَ يَوْمَئِذٍ وَاهِيَةٌ ﴿ (And the heaven will be rent asunder, for that Day it (the heaven) will be frail and torn up.)(69:16), ﴾وَيَوْمَ تَشَقَّقُ السَّمَآءُ بِالْغَمَـمِ وَنُزِّلَ الْمَلَـئِكَةُ تَنزِيلاً ﴿ (And (remember) the Day when the heaven shall be rent asunder with clouds, and the angels will be sent down, with a grand descending.)(25:25) and, ﴾إِذَا السَّمَآءُ انشَقَّتْ - وَأَذِنَتْ لِرَبِّهَا وَحُقَّتْ ﴿ (When the heaven is split asunder, and listens to and obeys its Lord -- and it must do so.)(84:1-2) Allah's statement, ﴾فَكَانَتْ وَرْدَةً كَالدِّهَانِ﴿ (and it becomes Wardah like Dihan.) This means they will melt just as sediment and silver are melted when heated. And they will be colored, just as dies stain something, sometimes red, sometimes yellow, or blue, or green. This demonstrates the extent of the horrors of the Mighty Day of Resurrection. As-Suddi said, \"It will be as rosy color and as filth oil.\" Mujahid said ﴾كَالدِّهَانِ﴿ (like Dihan), \"Like the colors of dyes.\" Allah said; ﴾فَيَوْمَئِذٍ لاَّ يُسْـَلُ عَن ذَنبِهِ إِنسٌ وَلاَ جَآنٌّ ﴿ (So on that Day he will not be questioned about his sins, (neither) human nor Jinn.) this is similar to His saying; ﴾هَـذَا يَوْمُ لاَ يَنطِقُونَ - وَلاَ يُؤْذَنُ لَهُمْ فَيَعْتَذِرُونَ ﴿ (That will be a Day when they shall not speak, and they will not be permitted to put forth any excuse.)(77:35-36) This is the case at the time, then all the creatures will be questioned about their deeds. Allah said; ﴾فَوَرَبِّكَ لَنَسْـَلَنَّهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ - عَمَّا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ ﴿ (So, by your Lord, We shall certainly call all of them to account. For all that they used to do.)(15:92-93) Qatadah said, \"On that they will be questioned and then their mouths will be sealed and their hands and feet will reveal what they used to do.\" Allah the Exalted said, ﴾يُعْرَفُ الْمُجْرِمُونَ بِسِيمَـهُمْ﴿ (The criminals will be known by their marks,) i.e., by special marks that distinguish them. Al-Hasan and Qatadah said, \"They will be known by their dark faces and their blue eyes.\" I say that this contrasts to the marks that will distinguish the believers, such as the light that will appear on the parts of the body that they used to wash while performing ablution. Allah said, ﴾فَيُؤْخَذُ بِالنَّوَاصِى وَالاٌّقْدَامِ﴿ (and they will be seized by their foreheads and feet.) meaning, the angels of punishment will bend their heads down to their feet and throw them like this into the Hellfire. Al-A`mash said that Ibn `Abbas said, \"He will be taken by his forehead and his feet and be broken just as a stick is broken to be thrown into an oven.\" Allah said, ﴾هَـذِهِ جَهَنَّمُ الَّتِى يُكَذِّبُ بِهَا الْمُجْرِمُونَ ﴿ (This is the Hell which the criminals denied.) meaning, `this is the Fire that you used to deny existed that it; now you see it before your eyes!' While being chastised, criticized, disgraced and belittled, this will be said to the disbelievers. ﴾يَطُوفُونَ بَيْنَهَا وَبَيْنَ حَمِيمٍ ءَانٍ ﴿ (They will go between it and Hamim An!) meaning, they will sometimes be punished with fire and they will sometimes be given Hamim which is a drink like molten copper tearing their intestines and internal organs, ﴾إِذِ الاٌّغْلَـلُ فِى أَعْنَـقِهِمْ والسَّلَـسِلُ يُسْحَبُونَ - فِى الْحَمِيمِ ثُمَّ فِى النَّارِ يُسْجَرُونَ ﴿ (When the iron collars will be rounded over their necks, and the chains, they shall be dragged along, in the Hamim, then they will be burned in the Fire.)(40:71-72) Allah said ﴾ءَانٍ﴿ (An) meaning hot, due to the fierce and intense heat that is impossible to bear. Ibn `Abbas said; ﴾يَطُوفُونَ بَيْنَهَا وَبَيْنَ حَمِيمٍ ءَانٍ ﴿ (They will go between it and Hamim An!) \"That has reached the ultimate temperature and boiling fiercely.\" Similar was said by Mujahid, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Ad-Dahhak, Al-Hasan, Ath-Thawri and As-Suddi. Qatadah also commented, \"Its boiling started when Allah created the heavens and the earth!\" Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi said, \"The (disobedient) servant will be seized by the forehead and stirred in that boiling water until his flesh melts and only the bones and the eyes in his head remain. This is the meaning of Allah's statement, ﴾فِى الْحَمِيمِ ثُمَّ فِى النَّارِ يُسْجَرُونَ ﴿ (In the Hamim, then they will be burned in the Fire.)(40:72) And Al-Hamim Al-An means hot.\" There is another report from Al-Qurazi; ﴾حَمِيمٍ ءَانٍ﴿ (Hamim An) that it means \"prepared. \" This is also the view of Ibn Zayd. And saying that it means \"prepared\" does not contradict the first report from Al-Qurazi which says that it means hot, for Allah said: ﴾تُسْقَى مِنْ عَيْنٍ ءَانِيَةٍ ﴿ (They will be given to drink from a spring, Aniyah.) (88:5) which means severe unbearable heat, and His saying; ﴾غَيْرَ نَـظِرِينَ إِنَـهُ﴿ (not to wait for it to be prepared)(33:53) which means properly cooking and preparing it. So His saying; ﴾حَمِيمٍ ءَانٍ﴿ (Hamim An.) Hamim, that is very hot. Surely, punishing the disobedient criminals as well as favoring those who had Taqwa, is from Allah's grace, mercy, justice, compassion and kindness for His creatures. His warnings against His torment and punishment, such as mentioned in these Ayat, should encourage all creatures to abandon the Shirk and disobedience they engage in, and this is why Allah reminded them of this favor; ﴾فَبِأَىِّ ءَالاءِ رَبِّكُمَا تُكَذِّبَانِ ﴿ (Then which of the blessings of your Lord will you both deny) "

  55,53,"<h2>The Delight of Those Who have Taqwa in Paradise</h2> Allah the Exalted said,  وَلِمَنْ خَافَ مَقَامَ رَبِّهِ  (But for him who fears the standing before his Lord,) on the Day of Resurrection,  وَنَهَى النَّفْسَ عَنِ الْهَوَى  (And restrained himself from the desires.) (79:40), and does not indulge nor prefer this worldly life. He who knows that the Hereafter is better and more lasting, so he fulfills what his Lord ordered him and stays away from His prohibitions, then he will earn two gardens from his Lord on the Day of Resurrection. Al-Bukhari recorded that `Abdullah bin Qays said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,  «جَنَّتَانِ مِنْ فِضَّةٍ آنِيَتُهُمَا وَمَا فِيهِمَا، وَجَنَّتَانِ مِنْ ذَهَبٍ آنِيَتُهُمَا وَمَا فِيهِمَا، وَمَا بَيْنَ الْقَوْمِ وَبَيْنَ أَنْ يَنْظُرُوا إِلَى رَبِّهِمْ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ إِلَّا رِدَاءُ الْكِبْرِيَاءِ عَلَى وَجْهِهِ فِي جَنَّةِ عَدْن»  (There are two gardens made of silver -- their vessels and all that they contain. And there are two gardens made of gold -- their vessels and all that they contain. And nothing stands between the people in the `Adn Garden and looking at their Lord, the Exalted and Most Honored, but the covering of pride before His Face.) The Group, with the exception of Abu Dawud, collected this via the Hadith of `Abdul-`Aziz. This Ayah is general and applies to both humans and Jinns, providing proof that those among the Jinns who believe and have Taqwa will enter Paradise, for Allah is reminding the Ath-Thaqalayn of this favor, as He says;  وَلِمَنْ خَافَ مَقَامَ رَبِّهِ جَنَّتَانِ فَبِأَىِّ ءَالاءِ رَبِّكُمَا تُكَذِّبَانِ  (But for him who fears the standing before his Lord, there will be two Gardens. Then which of the blessings of your Lord will you both deny) Then He describes these two gardens, by saying,  ذَوَاتَآ أَفْنَانٍ  (With Afnan.) their trees have beautiful young branches that hold and produce every type of ripened beautiful fruit,  فَبِأَىِّ ءَالاءِ رَبِّكُمَا تُكَذِّبَانِ  (Then which of the blessings of your Lord will you both deny) `Ata' Al-Khurasani and several others said that Afnan means spreading branches of trees that reach the branches of other trees,  فِيهِمَا عَيْنَانِ تَجْرِيَانِ  (In them (both) will be two springs flowing.) free to water these trees and branches that produce all kinds of fruits,  فَبِأَىِّ ءَالاءِ رَبِّكُمَا تُكَذِّبَانِ  (Then which of the blessings of your Lord will you both deny) Al-Hasan Al-Basri said that one of these springs is called Tasnim, and the other called As-Salsabil. `Atiyah said that the water of one of these springs is from non-standing water and the other from wine that gives delight to those who drink it. Allah's statement,  فِيهِمَا مِن كُلِّ فَـكِهَةٍ زَوْجَانِ  (In them (both) will be every kind of fruit in pairs.), of every type and kind of fruit, that which they knew before, and better, and that which they did not know before. Therein, there are delights that no eye has ever seen, no ear has ever heard and no heart has ever imagined,  فَبِأَىِّ ءَالاءِ رَبِّكُمَا تُكَذِّبَانِ  (Then which of the blessings of your Lord will you both deny) Ibrahim bin Al-Hakam bin Aban said that his father narrated from `Ikrimah that Ibn `Abbas said, \"There is not a fruit that exists in this life, sweet or bitter, but it exists in Paradise, even the colo- cynth.\" Ibn `Abbas also said, \"There is nothing in the world that is in the Hereafter except in name.\" Meaning there is such an enormous difference and contrast between the two in enjoyment and value.

  55,61," مُتَّكِئِينَ  (Reclining), in reference to the residents of Paradise, who will recline or sit cross-legged;  عَلَى فُرُشٍ بَطَآئِنُهَا مِنْ إِسْتَبْرَقٍ  (upon the couches lined with Istabraq,) which is thick silk brocade, according to `Ikrimah, Ad-Dahhak and Qatadah. Abu `Imran Al-Jawni said, \"It is thick silk embroidered with gold.\" In this way, the honor of the outside is alluded to by mentioning the honor of the inside. Abu Ishaq narrated that Hubayrah bin Yarim said that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"This is their interior, so what about it if you see their exterior\" Allah said,  وَجَنَى الْجَنَّتَيْنِ دَانٍ  (and the fruits of the two Gardens will be near at hand.) close to the believers who will be able to take any of it they wish, whether they are reclining or otherwise,  قُطُوفُهَا دَانِيَةٌ  (The fruits in bunches whereof will be low and near at hand.)(69:23),  وَدَانِيَةً عَلَيْهِمْ ظِلَـلُهَا وَذُلِّلَتْ قُطُوفُهَا تَذْلِيلاً  (And the shade thereof is. close upon them, and the bunches of fruit thereof will hang low within their reach.)(76:14), meaning, these fruits descend from their branches to those who wish to have them, because they are close at hand,  فَبِأَىِّ ءَالاءِ رَبِّكُمَا تُكَذِّبَانِ  (Then which of the blessings of your Lord will you both deny) After Allah mentioned the couches, He then said,  فِيهِنَّ  (Wherein will be), meaning on these couches or beds,  قَـصِرَتُ الطَّرْفِ  (Qasirat At-Tarf) chaste females, wives restraining their glances, desiring none except their husbands, seeing them as the most beautiful men in Paradise. This was said by Ibn `Abbas, Qatadah, `Ata' Al-Khurasani and Ibn Zayd. It was reported that one of these wives will say to her husband, \"By Allah! I neither see anything in Paradise more handsome than you nor more beloved to me than you. So praise be to Allah Who made you for me and made me for you.\" Allah said,  لَمْ يَطْمِثْهُنَّ إِنسٌ قَبْلَهُمْ وَلاَ جَآنٌّ  (whom never deflowered a human before nor Jinn ) meaning they are delightful virgins of comparable age who never had sexual intercourse with anyone, whether from mankind or Jinns, before their husbands. This is also a proof that the believers among the Jinns will enter Paradise. Artat bin Al-Mundhir said, \"Damrah bin Habib was asked if the Jinns will enter Paradise and he said, `Yes, and they will get married. The Jinns will have Jinn women and the humans will have female humans.\"' Allah's statement,  لَمْ يَطْمِثْهُنَّ إِنسٌ قَبْلَهُمْ وَلاَ جَآنٌّ فَبِأَىِّ ءَالاءِ رَبِّكُمَا تُكَذِّبَانِ  (whom never deflowered a human before nor Jinn. Then which of the blessings of your Lord will you both deny) Then Allah describes these women for the proposed:  كَأَنَّهُنَّ الْيَاقُوتُ وَالْمَرْجَانُ  (they are like Yaqut and Marjan.) Mujahid, Al-Hasan, Ibn Zayd and others said, \"They are as pure as rubies and white as Marjan.\" So here they described Marjan as pearls. Imam Muslim recorded that Muhammad bin Sirin said, \"Some people either boasted or just wondered who are more in Paradise, men or women. Abu Hurayrah said, `Has not Abu Al-Qasim (Muhammad  ﷺ) said,  «إِنَّ أَوَّلَ زُمْرَةٍ تَدْخُلُ الْجَنَّةَ عَلَى صُورَةِ الْقَمَرِ لَيْلَةَ الْبَدْرِ، وَالَّتِي تَلِيهَا عَلَى (أَضْوَءِ) كَوْكَبٍ دُرِّيَ فِي السَّمَاءِ، لِكُلِّ امْرِىءٍ مِنْهُمْ زَوْجَتَانِ اثْنَتَانِ، يُرَى مُخُّ سُوقِهِمَا مِنْ وَرَاءِ اللَّحْمِ، وَمَا فِي الْجَنَّةِ أَعْزَب»  (Verily, the first group that will enter Paradise will look like the moon when it is full, and the next batch will be as radiant as the radiant star in the sky. Each one of them will marry two wives. The marrow of the bones of their shins will be seen through the flesh. None will be unmarried in Paradise.) This Hadith was recorded in the Two Sahihs. Imam Ahmad recorded that Anas said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,  «لَغَدْوَةٌ فِي سَبِيلِ اللهِ أَوْ رَوْحَةٌ خَيْرٌ مِنَ الدُّنْيَا وَمَا فِيهَا، وَلَقَابُ قَوسِ أَحَدِكُمْ، أَوْ مَوْضِعُ قِدِّهِ يَعْنِي سَوْطَهُ مِنَ الْجَنَّةِ خَيْرٌ مِنَ الدُّنْيَا وَمَا فِيهَا، وَلَوِ اطَّلَعَتِ امْرَأَةٌ مِنْ نِسَاءِ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ إِلَى الْأَرْضِ لَمَلَأَتْ مَا بَيْنَهُمَا رِيحًا، وَلَطَابَ مَا بَيْنَهُمَا، وَلَنَصِيفُهَا عَلَى رَأْسِهَا خَيْرٌ مِنَ الدُّنْيَا وَمَا فِيهَا»  (A morning or an evening journey in Allah's cause is better than the world and whatever is on its surface. And a place in Paradise as small as that occupied by the whip of one of you, is better than the world and whatever is on its surface. If one of the women of the people of Paradise looks directly at the earth, she will fill what is between Paradise and earth with a good scent and all of it will become delightful. Verily, the veil over her head is better than this life and all that is on its surface.) Al-Bukhari also collected a similar narration. Allah the Exalted said,  هَلْ جَزَآءُ الإِحْسَـنِ إِلاَّ الإِحْسَـنُ  (Is there any reward for good other than good) Allah declares that in the Hereafter, all that is good and righteous is the only befitting reward for those who do good deeds in this life,  لِّلَّذِينَ أَحْسَنُواْ الْحُسْنَى وَزِيَادَةٌ  (For those who have done good is best (reward) and even more.)(10:26) All of these are tremendous blessings that cannot be earned merely by good deeds, but by Allah's favor and bounty, after all of these He says;  فَبِأَىِّ ءَالاءِ رَبِّكُمَا تُكَذِّبَانِ  (Then which of the blessings of your Lord will you both deny) "
