tafsir[15]{c,v,t}:
  23,90,"<h2>The Idolators believe in Tawhid Ar-Rububiyyah, which requires them to believe in Tawhid Al-Uluhiyyah</h2> Allah states that the fact that He is One and that He is independent in His creation, control, dominion and guides one to realize that there is no God except Him and that none should be worshipped except Him Alone, with no partner or associate. He tells His Messenger Muhammad ﷺ to say to the idolators who worship others besides Him, even though they admit His Lordship, that He has no partner in Lordship. But despite this they still attributed partners in divinity to Him, and worshipped others besides Him even though they recognized the fact that those whom they worshipped could not create anything, did not own anything, nor do they have any control over anything. However, they still believed that these creatures could bring them closer to Allah,  مَا نَعْبُدُهُمْ إِلاَّ لِيُقَرِّبُونَآ إِلَى اللَّهِ زُلْفَى  (We worship them only that they may bring us near to Allah) 39:3. So Allah says:  قُل لِّمَنِ الاٌّرْضُ وَمَن فِيهَآ  (Say: \"Whose is the earth and whosoever is therein\") meaning, \"Who is the Owner Who has created it and whatever is in it of animals, plants, fruits and all other kinds of creation\"  إِن كُنتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَسَيَقُولُونَ لِلَّهِ  (\"If you know!\" They will say: \"It is Allah's!\") means, they will admit that this belongs to Allah Alone with no partner or associate. If that is the case,  قُلْ أَفَلاَ تَذَكَّرُونَ  (Say: \"Will you not then remember\") that none should be worshipped except the Creator and Provider.  قُلْ مَن رَّبُّ السَّمَـوَتِ السَّبْعِ وَرَبُّ الْعَرْشِ الْعَظِيمِ  (Say: \"Who is Lord of the seven heavens, and Lord of the Great Throne\") means, \"Who is the Creator of the higher realm with its planets, lights and angels who submit to Him in all regions and in all directions Who is the Lord of the Great Throne, which is the highest of all created things\" Allah says here:  وَرَبُّ الْعَرْشِ الْعَظِيمِ  (and Lord of the Great Throne), meaning the Mighty Throne. At the end of the Surah, Allah says:  رَبُّ الْعَرْشِ الْكَرِيمِ  (the Lord of the Supreme Throne!) 23:116, meaning splendid and magnificent. The Throne combines the features of height and vastness with splendor and magnificence. This is why it was said that it is made of red rubies. Ibn Mas`ud said, \"There is no night or day with your Lord, and the light of the Throne is from the Light of His Face.\"  سَيَقُولُونَ لِلَّهِ قُلْ أَفَلاَ تَتَّقُونَ  (They will say: \"Allah.\" Say: \"Will you not then have Taqwa\") meaning, since you admit that He is the Lord of the heavens and the Lord of the Mighty Throne, will you not fear His punishment for worshipping others besides Him and associating others with Him  قُلْ مَن بِيَدِهِ مَلَكُوتُ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ  (Say: \"In Whose Hand is the sovereignty of everything\") i.e., sovereignty is in His Hands.  مَّا مِن دَآبَّةٍ إِلاَّ هُوَ ءاخِذٌ بِنَاصِيَتِهَآ  (There is not a moving creature but He has grasp of its forelock) 11:56. meaning, He has control over it. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ used to say,  «لَا وَالَّذِي نَفْسِي بِيَدِه»  (By the One in Whose hand is my soul.) When he swore an oath, he would say,  «لَا وَمُقَلِّبِ الْقُلُوب»  (By the One Who turns over (controls) the hearts.) He, may He be glorified, is the Creator, the Sovereign, the Controller,  وَهُوَ يُجْيِرُ وَلاَ يُجَارُ عَلَيْهِ إِن كُنتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ  (And He protects (all), while against Whom there is no protector, if you know) Among the Arabs, if a leader announced his protection to a person, no one could go against him in that, yet no one could offer protection against that leader. Allah says:  وَهُوَ يُجْيِرُ وَلاَ يُجَارُ عَلَيْهِ  (And He protects (all), while against Whom there is no protector, ) meaning, He is the greatest Master, and there is none greater than Him. His is the power to create and to command, and none can overturn or oppose His ruling. What He wills happens, and what He does not, will not happen. Allah says:  لاَ يُسْأَلُ عَمَّا يَفْعَلُ وَهُمْ يُسْـَلُونَ  (He cannot be questioned about what He does, while they will be questioned.) 21:23 He cannot be asked about what He does because of His greatness, Pride, overwhelming power, wisdom and justice, but all of His creation will be asked about what they did, as Allah says:  فَوَرَبِّكَ لَنَسْـَلَنَّهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ - عَمَّا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ  (So, by your Lord, We shall certainly call all of them to account. For all that they used to do.) 15:92-93  سَيَقُولُونَ لِلَّهِ  (They will say: \"(All that belongs) to Allah.\") means, they will admit that the Almighty Master Who protects all while against Him there is no protector is Allah Alone, with no partner or associate.  قُلْ فَأَنَّى تُسْحَرُونَ  (Say: \"How then are you deceived and turn away from the truth\") means, how can your minds accept the idea of worshipping others besides Him when you recognize and acknowledge that Then Allah says:  بَلْ أَتَيْنَـهُمْ بِالْحَقِّ  (Nay, but We have brought them the truth,) which is the declaration that there is no god worthy of worship besides Allah, and the establishment of clear, definitive and sound proof to that effect,  وَإِنَّهُمْ لَكَـذِبُونَ  (and verily, they are liars.) means, in their worship of others alongside Allah when they have no evidence for doing so, as Allah says at the end of this Surah:  وَمَن يَدْعُ مَعَ اللَّهِ إِلَـهَا ءَاخَرَ لاَ بُرْهَانَ لَهُ بِهِ فَإِنَّمَا حِسَابُهُ عِندَ رَبِّهِ إِنَّهُ لاَ يُفْلِحُ الْكَـفِرُونَ  (And whoever invokes, besides Allah, any other god, of whom he has no proof; then his reckoning is only with his Lord. Surely, the disbelievers will not be successful.) 23:117 The idolators have no evidence for what they are doing, which has led them into lies and misguidance. Rather they are following their forefathers and predecessors who were confused and ignorant, as Allah describes them:  إِنَّا وَجَدْنَآ ءَابَآءَنَا عَلَى أُمَّةٍ وَإِنَّا عَلَى ءَاثَـرِهِم مُّقْتَدُونَ  (\"We found our fathers following a certain way and religion, and we will indeed follow their footsteps.\") 43:23 "

  23,92,"<h2>Allah has no Partner or Associate</h2> Allah declares Himself to be above having any child or partner in dominion, control and worship. He says: ﴾مَا اتَّخَذَ اللَّهُ مِن وَلَدٍ وَمَا كَانَ مَعَهُ مِنْ إِلَـهٍ إِذاً لَّذَهَبَ كُلُّ إِلَـهٍ بِمَا خَلَقَ وَلَعَلاَ بَعْضُهُمْ عَلَى بَعْضٍ﴿ (No son did Allah beget, nor is there any god along with Him. (If there had been many gods), then each god would have taken away what he had created, and some would have tried to overcome others.) meaning, if it were decreed that there should be a plurality of deities, each of them would have exclusive control over whatever he had created, so there would never be any order in the universe. But what we see is that the universe is ordered and cohesive, with the upper and lower realms connected to one another in the most perfect fashion. ﴾مَّا تَرَى فِى خَلْقِ الرَّحْمَـنِ مِن تَفَـوُتٍ﴿ (you can see no fault in the creation of the Most Gracious) 65:3. Moreover, if there were a number of gods, each of them would try to subdue the other with enmity, and one would prevail over the other. This has been mentioned by the scholars of `Ilm-ul-Kalam, who discussed it using the evidence of mutual resistance or counteraction. This idea states that if there were two or more creators, one would want to make a body move while the other would want to keep it immobile, and if neither of them could achieve what they wanted, then both would be incapable, but the One Whose existence is essential i.e., Allah cannot be incapable. It is impossible for the will of both to be fulfilled because of the conflict. This dilemma only arises when a plurality of gods is suggested, so it is impossible for there to be such a plurality, because if the will of one is fulfilled and not the other, the one who prevails will be the one whose existence is essential (i.e., God) and the one who is prevailed over will be merely possible (i.e., he is not divine), because it is not befitting for the one to be defeated whose existence is essential. Allah says: ﴾وَلَعَلاَ بَعْضُهُمْ عَلَى بَعْضٍ سُبْحَـنَ اللَّهِ عَمَّا يَصِفُونَ﴿ (and some would have tried to overcome others! Glorified be Allah above all that they attribute to Him!) meaning, high above all that the stubborn wrongdoers say when they claim that He has a son or partner. ﴾عَـلِمُ الْغَيْبِ وَالشَّهَـدَةِ﴿ (All-Knower of the unseen and the seen!) means, He knows what is hidden from His creatures and what they see. ﴾فَتَعَـلَى عَمَّا يُشْرِكُونَ﴿ (Exalted be He over all that they associate as partners to Him!) means, sanctified and glorified and exalted be He above all that the wrongdoers and liars say.

  23,98,"<h2>The Command to call on Allah when Calamity strikes, to repel Evil with that which is better, and to seek refuge with Allah</h2> Allah commands His Prophet Muhammad ﷺ to call on Him with this supplication when calamity strikes:  رَّبِّ إِمَّا تُرِيَنِّى مَا يُوعَدُونَ  (My Lord! If You would show me that with which they are threatened.) meaning, `if You punish them while I am witnessing that, then do not cause me to be one of them.' As was said in the Hadith recorded by Imam Ahmad and At-Tirmidhi, who graded it Sahih:  «وَإِذَا أَرَدْتَ بِقَومٍ فِتْنَةً فَتَوفَّنِي إِلَيْكَ غَيْرَ مَفْتُون»  (If You want to test people, then take me to You cause me to die without having to undergo the test.)  وَإِنَّا عَلَى أَن نُّرِيَكَ مَا نَعِدُهُمْ لَقَـدِرُونَ  (And indeed We are able to show you that with which We have threatened them.) means, `if We willed, We could show you the punishment and test that We will send upon them.' Then Allah shows him the best way to behave when mixing with people, which is to treat kindly the one who treats him badly, so as to soften his heart and turn his enmity to friendship, and to turn his hatred to love. Allah says:  ادْفَعْ بِالَّتِى هِىَ أَحْسَنُ السَّيِّئَةَ  (Repel evil with that which is better. ) This is like the Ayah:  ادْفَعْ بِالَّتِى هِىَ أَحْسَنُ فَإِذَا الَّذِى بَيْنَكَ وَبَيْنَهُ عَدَاوَةٌ كَأَنَّهُ وَلِىٌّ حَمِيمٌوَمَا يُلَقَّاهَا إِلاَّ الَّذِينَ صَبَرُواْ  (Repel (the evil) with one which is better, then verily he, between whom and you there was enmity, (will become) as though he was a close friend. But none is granted it except those who are patient) 41:34-35. meaning, nobody will be helped or inspired to follow this advice or attain this quality,  إِلاَّ الَّذِينَ صَبَرُواْ  (except those who are patient) meaning, those who patiently bear people's insults and bad treatment and deal with them in a good manner when they are on the receiving end of bad treatment from them.  وَمَا يُلَقَّاهَآ إِلاَّ ذُو حَظِّ عَظِيمٍ  (and none is granted it except the owner of the great portion) means, in this world and the Hereafter. And Allah says:  وَقُلْ رَّبِّ أَعُوذُ بِكَ مِنْ هَمَزَاتِ الشَّيـطِينِ  (And say: \"My Lord! I seek refuge with You from the whisperings of the Shayatin.\") Allah commanded him to seek refuge with Him from the Shayatin, because no trick could help you against them and you cannot protect yourself by being kind to them. We have already stated, when discussing Isti`adhah (seeking refuge), that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ used to say,  «أَعُوذُ بِاللهِ السَّمِيعِ الْعَلِيمِ مِنَ الشَّيْطَانِ الرَّجِيمِ مِنْ هَمْزِهِ وَنَفْخِهِ وَنَفْثِه»  (I seek refuge with Allah, the All-Hearing, All-Seeing, from the accursed Shayatin, from his whisperings, evil suggestions and insinuations.) His saying:  وَأَعُوذُ بِكَ رَبِّ أَن يَحْضُرُونِ  (\"And I seek refuge with You, My Lord! lest they should come near me.\") means, in any issue of my life. So we are commanded to mention Allah at the beginning of any undertaking, in order to ward off the Shayatin at the time of eating, intercourse, slaughtering animals for food, etc. Abu Dawud recorded that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ used to say:  «اللَّهُمَّ إِنِّي أَعُوذُ بِكَ مِنَ الْهَرَمِ، وَأَعُوذُ بِكَ مِنَ الْهَدْمِ وَمِنَ الْغَرَقِ، وَأَعُوذُ بِكَ مِنْ أَنْ يَتَخَبَّطَنِي الشَّيْطَانُ عِنْدَ الْمَوْت»  (O Allah, I seek refuge with You from old age, I seek refuge with You from being crushed or drowned, and I seek refuge with you from being assaulted by the Shayatin at the time of death.)

  23,100,"<h2>The Disbelievers' Hope when death approaches Allah tells us about what happens when death approaches one of the disbelievers orone of those who have been negligent with the commands of Allah. He tells us what he says and how he asks to come back to this world so that he can rectify whatever wrongs he committed during his lifetime. Allah says:</h2>﴾رَبِّ ارْجِعُونِلَعَلِّى أَعْمَلُ صَـلِحاً فِيمَا تَرَكْتُ كَلاَّ﴿ (\"My Lord! Send me back, so that I may do good in that which I have left behind!\" No!) This is like the Ayat: ﴾وَأَنفِقُواْ مِن مَّا رَزَقْنَـكُمْ مِّن قَبْلِ أَن يَأْتِىَ أَحَدَكُمُ الْمَوْتُ﴿ (And spend of that with which We have provided you before death comes to one of you,) until His saying: ﴾وَاللَّهُ خَبِيرٌ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ﴿ (And Allah is All-Aware of what you do) 63:10-11 ﴾وَأَنذِرِ النَّاسَ يَوْمَ يَأْتِيهِمُ الْعَذَابُ﴿<h2>(And warn mankind of the Day when the torment will come unto them)</h2>﴾مَا لَكُمْ مِّن زَوَالٍ﴿ upto His saying; (that you would not leave (the world for the Hereafter).) 14:44 And His saying: ﴾يَوْمَ يَأْتِى تَأْوِيلُهُ يَقُولُ الَّذِينَ نَسُوهُ مِن قَبْلُ قَدْ جَآءَتْ رُسُلُ رَبِّنَا بِالْحَقِّ فَهَل لَّنَا مِن شُفَعَآءَ فَيَشْفَعُواْ لَنَآ أَوْ نُرَدُّ فَنَعْمَلَ غَيْرَ الَّذِى كُنَّا نَعْمَلُ﴿ (On the Day the event is finally fulfilled, those who neglected it before will say: \"Verily, the Messengers of our Lord did come with the truth, now are there any intercessors for us that they might intercede on our behalf Or could we be sent back so that we might do deeds other than those deeds which we used to do\") 7:53 And: ﴾وَلَوْ تَرَى إِذِ الْمُجْرِمُونَ نَاكِسُواْ رُءُوسِهِمْ عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ رَبَّنَآ أَبْصَرْنَا وَسَمِعْنَا فَارْجِعْنَا نَعْمَلْ صَـلِحاً إِنَّا مُوقِنُونَ ﴿ (And if you only could see when the criminals shall hang their heads before their Lord (saying): \"Our Lord! We have now seen and heard, so send us back, that we will do righteous good deeds. Verily, we now believe with certainty.\") 32:12 And; ﴾وَلَوْ تَرَى إِذْ وُقِفُواْ عَلَى النَّارِ فَقَالُواْ يلَيْتَنَا نُرَدُّ وَلاَ نُكَذِّبَ بِـَايَـتِ رَبِّنَا﴿ (If you could but see when they will be held over the (Hell) Fire! They will say: \"Would that we were but sent back! Then we would not deny the Ayat of our Lord. ..\") until His saying; ﴾وَإِنَّهُمْ لَكَـذِبُونَ﴿ (And indeed they are liars.) 6:27-28 ﴾وَتَرَى الظَّـلِمِينَ لَمَّا رَأَوُاْ الْعَذَابَ يَقُولُونَ هَلْ إِلَى مَرَدٍّ مِّن سَبِيلٍ﴿ (And you will see the wrongdoers, when they behold the torment, they will say: \"Is there any way of return\") 42:44 ﴾قَالُواْ رَبَّنَآ أَمَتَّنَا اثْنَتَيْنِ وَأَحْيَيْتَنَا اثْنَتَيْنِ فَاعْتَرَفْنَا بِذُنُوبِنَا فَهَلْ إِلَى خُرُوجٍ مِّن سَبِيلٍ ﴿ (They will say: \"Our Lord! You have made us to die twice, and You have given us life twice! Now we confess our sins, then is there any way to get out\") 40:11 and the Ayah after it: ﴾وَهُمْ يَصْطَرِخُونَ فِيهَا رَبَّنَآ أَخْرِجْنَا نَعْمَلْ صَـلِحاً غَيْرَ الَّذِى كُـنَّا نَعْمَلُ أَوَلَمْ نُعَمِّرْكُمْ مَّا يَتَذَكَّرُ فِيهِ مَن تَذَكَّرَ وَجَآءَكُمُ النَّذِيرُ فَذُوقُواْ فَمَا لِلظَّـلِمِينَ مِن نَّصِيرٍ ﴿ (Therein they will cry: \"Our Lord! Bring us out, we shall do righteous good deeds, not what we used to do.\" (Allah will reply:) \"Did We not give you lives long enough, so that whosoever would receive admonition could receive it And the warner came to you. So taste you (the evil of your deeds). For the wrongdoers there is no helper.\") 35:37 Allah says that they will ask to go back, when death approaches, on the Day of Resurrection, when they are gathered for judgment before the Compeller (Allah) and when they are in the agonies of the punishment of Hell, but their prayer will not be answered. Here Allah says: ﴾كَلاَّ إِنَّهَا كَلِمَةٌ هُوَ قَآئِلُهَا﴿ (No! It is but a word that he speaks;) The word Kalla (No!) is a word that is used to rebuke, and the meaning is: \"No, We will not respond to what he asks for and We will not accept it from him.\" ﴾إِنَّهَا كَلِمَةٌ هُوَ قَآئِلُهَا﴿ (It is but a word that he speaks) refers to his asking to go back so that he can do righteous deeds; this is just talk on his part, it would not be accompanied by any action. If he were to go back, he would not do any righteous good deeds, he is merely lying, as Allah says: ﴾وَلَوْ رُدُّواْ لَعَـدُواْ لِمَا نُهُواْ عَنْهُ وَإِنَّهُمْ لَكَـذِبُونَ﴿ (But if they were returned, they would certainly revert to that which they were forbidden. And indeed they are liars) 6:28. Qatadah said: \"By Allah, he will not wish to go back to his family and tribe, or to accumulate more of the things of this world or satisfy his desires, but he will wish that he could go back to do acts of obedience to Allah. May Allah have mercy on a man who does that which the disbeliever will wish he had done when he sees the punishment of Hell.\" <h2>Barzakh and Punishment therein</h2>﴾وَمِن وَرَآئِهِمْ بَرْزَخٌ إِلَى يَوْمِ يُبْعَثُونَ﴿ (and in front of them is Barzakh until the Day when they will be resurrected.) Abu Salih and others said that: ﴾وَمِن وَرَآئِهِمْ﴿ (and in front of them) means before them. Mujahid said, Al-Barzakh is a barrier between this world and the Hereafter. Muhammad bin Ka`b said, \"Al-Barzakh is what is between this world and the Hereafter, neither they are the people of this world, eating and drinking, nor are they with the people of the Hereafter, being rewarded or punished for their deeds.\" Abu Sakhr said, \"Al-Barzakh refers to the graves. They are neither in this world nor the Hereafter, and they will stay there until the Day of Resurrection.\" ﴾وَمِن وَرَآئِهِمْ بَرْزَخٌ﴿ (and in front of them is Barzakh). In these words is a threat to those wrongdoers at the time of death, of the punishment of Barzakh. This is similar to the Ayat: ﴾مِّن وَرَآئِهِمْ جَهَنَّمُ﴿ (In front of them there is Hell) 45:10. ﴾وَمِن وَرَآئِهِ عَذَابٌ غَلِيظٌ﴿ (and in front of him will be a great torment) 14: 17. ﴾إِلَى يَوْمِ يُبْعَثُونَ﴿ (until the Day when they will be resurrected). means, he will be punished continually until the Day of Resurrection, as it says in the Hadith: ﴾«فَلَا يَزَالُ مُعَذَّبًا فِيهَا»﴿ (He will continue to be punished in it.) meaning, in the earth.

  23,104,"<h2>The sounding of the Trumpet and the weighing of Deeds in the Scales.</h2> Allah says that when the Trumpet is blown for the Resurrection, and the people rise from their graves, ﴾فَلاَ أَنسَـبَ بَيْنَهُمْ يَوْمَئِذٍ وَلاَ يَتَسَآءَلُونَ﴿ (there will be no kinship among them that Day, nor will they ask of one another.) meaning that lineage will be of no avail on that Day, and a father will not ask about his son or care about him. Allah says: ﴾وَلاَ يَسْـَلُ حَمِيمٌ حَمِيماً يُبَصَّرُونَهُمْ﴿ (And no friend will ask a friend (about his condition), though they shall be made to see one another) 70:10-11. meaning, no relative will ask about another relative, even if he can see him and even if he is carrying a heavy burden. Even if he was the dearest of people to him in this world, he will not care about him or take even the slightest part of his burden from him. Allah says: ﴾يَوْمَ يَفِرُّ الْمَرْءُ مِنْ أَخِيهِ - وَأُمِّهِ وَأَبِيهِ - وَصَـحِبَتِهُ وَبَنِيهِ ﴿ (That Day shall a man flee from his brother. And from his mother and his father. And from his wife and his children.) 80:34-36 Ibn Mas`ud said, \"On the Day of Resurrection, Allah will gather the first and the last, then a voice will call out, `Whoever is owed something by another, let him come forth and take it.' And a man will rejoice if he is owed something or had been mistreated by his father or child or wife, even if it is little. \" This is confirmed in the Book of Allah, where Allah says: ﴾فَإِذَا نُفِخَ فِى الصُّورِ فَلاَ أَنسَـبَ بَيْنَهُمْ يَوْمَئِذٍ وَلاَ يَتَسَآءَلُونَ ﴿ (Then, when the Trumpet is blown, there will be no kinship among them that Day, nor will they ask of one another.) This was recorded by Ibn Abi Hatim. ﴾فَمَن ثَقُلَتْ مَوَزِينُهُ فَأُوْلَـئِكَ هُمُ الْمُفْلِحُونَ ﴿ (Then, those whose Scales are heavy, these! they are the successful.) means, the one whose good deeds outweigh his bad deeds, even by one. This was the view of Ibn `Abbas. ﴾فَأُوْلَـئِكَ هُمُ الْمُفْلِحُونَ﴿ (they are the successful.) means, those who have attained victory and been saved from Hell and admitted to Paradise. Ibn `Abbas said, \"These are the ones who have attained what they wanted and been saved from an evil from which there is no escape.\" ﴾وَمَنْ خَفَّتْ مَوَزِينُهُ﴿ (And those whose Scales are light,) means, their evil deeds outweigh their good deeds. ﴾فَأُوْلَـئِكَ الَّذِينَ خَسِرُواْ أَنفُسَهُم﴿ (they are those who lose themselves,) means, they are doomed and have ended up with the worst deal. Allah says: ﴾فِى جَهَنَّمَ خَـلِدُونَ﴿ (in Hell will they abide. ) meaning, they will stay there forever and will never leave. ﴾تَلْفَحُ وُجُوهَهُمُ النَّارُ﴿ (The Fire will burn their faces,) This is like the Ayah: ﴾وَتَغْشَى وُجُوهَهُمْ النَّارُ﴿ (and fire will cover their faces) 14:50. and: ﴾لَوْ يَعْلَمُ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ حِينَ لاَ يَكُفُّونَ عَن وُجُوهِهِمُ النَّارَ وَلاَ عَن ظُهُورِهِمْ﴿ (If only those who disbelieved knew (the time) when they will not be able to ward off the Fire from their faces, nor from their backs) 21:39. ﴾وَهُمْ فِيهَا كَـلِحُونَ﴿ (and therein they will grin, with displaced lips.) `Ali bin Abi Talhah narrated from Ibn `Abbas, \"Frowning.\" "
