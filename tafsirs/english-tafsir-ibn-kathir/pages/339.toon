  22,57,"<h2>The Disbelievers will remain in Doubt and Confusion</h2> Allah tells us that the disbelievers will remain in doubt concerning this Qur'an. This was the view of Ibn Jurayj and was the view favored by Ibn Jarir. ﴾حَتَّى تَأْتِيَهُمُ السَّاعَةُ بَغْتَةً﴿ (until the Hour comes suddenly upon them,) Mujahid said: \"By surprise.\" Qatadah said: ﴾بَغْتَةً﴿ (suddenly) means, the command of Allah will catch the people unaware. Allah never seizes a people except when they are intoxicated with pride, enjoying a life of luxury, and they think that the punishment will never come upon them, but Allah does not punish anyone except the evildoers. ﴾أَوْ يَأْتِيَهُمْ عَذَابُ يَوْمٍ عَقِيمٍ﴿ (or there comes to them the torment of Yawm `Aqim.) Mujahid said, \"Ubay bin Ka`b said: `Yawm `Aqim means the day of Badr.\"' `Ikrimah and Mujahid said: \"Yawm `Aqim means the Day of Resurrection, following which there will be no night.\" This was also the view of Ad-Dahhak and Al-Hasan Al-Basri. Allah says: ﴾الْمُلْكُ يَوْمَئِذٍ للَّهِ يَحْكُمُ بَيْنَهُمْ﴿ (The sovereignty on that Day will be that of Allah. He will judge between them.) This is like the Ayat: ﴾مَـلِكِ يَوْمِ الدِّينِ ﴿ (The Only Owner of the Day of Recompense) 1:4 ﴾الْمُلْكُ يَوْمَئِذٍ الْحَقُّ لِلرَّحْمَـنِ وَكَانَ يَوْماً عَلَى الْكَـفِرِينَ عَسِيراً ﴿ (The sovereignty on that Day will be the true (sovereignty), belonging to the Most Gracious (Allah), and it will be a hard Day for the disbelievers.) 25:26 ﴾فَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّـلِحَـتِ﴿ (So those who believed and did righteous good deeds) means, their hearts believed in Allah and His Messenger , and they acted in accor- dance with what they knew; their words and deeds were in harmony. ﴾فِى جَنَّـتِ النَّعِيمِ ﴿ (in Gardens of Delight.) means, they will enjoy eternal bliss which will never end or fade away. ﴾وَالَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ وَكَذَّبُواْ بِـَايَـتِنَآ﴿ (And those who disbelieved and denied Our Ayat,) means, their hearts rejected and denied the truth; they disbelieved in it and resisted the Messengers and were too proud to follow them. e ﴾فَأُوْلَـئِكَ لَهُمْ عَذَابٌ مُّهِينٌ﴿ (for them will be a humiliating torment. ) means, in recompense for arrogantly turning away from the truth. ﴾إِنَّ الَّذِينَ يَسْتَكْبِرُونَ عَنْ عِبَادَتِى سَيَدْخُلُونَ جَهَنَّمَ دَخِرِينَ﴿ (Verily, those who scorn My worship they will surely enter Hell in humiliation!) 40:60 "

  22,60,"<h2>The Great Reward for Those Who migrate in the Cause of Allah</h2> Allah tells us that those who migrate for the sake of Allah, seeking to earn His pleasure and that which is with Him, leaving behind their homelands, families and friends, leaving their countries for the sake of Allah and His Messenger to support His religion, then they are killed, i.e., in Jihad, or they die, i.e., they pass away without being involved in fighting, they will have earned an immense reward. As Allah says:  وَمَن يَخْرُجْ مِن بَيْتِهِ مُهَـجِراً إِلَى اللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ ثُمَّ يُدْرِكْهُ الْمَوْتُ فَقَدْ وَقَعَ أَجْرُهُ عَلىَ اللَّهِ  (And whosoever leaves his home as an emigrant unto Allah and His Messenger, and death overtakes him, his reward is then surely incumbent upon Allah) 4:100  لَيَرْزُقَنَّهُمُ اللَّهُ رِزْقاً حَسَناً  (surely, Allah will provide a good provision for them.) means, He will reward them from His bounty and provision in Paradise with that which will bring them joy.  وَإِنَّ اللَّهَ لَهُوَ خَيْرُ الرَزِقِينَ  لَيُدْخِلَنَّهُمْ مُّدْخَلاً يَرْضَوْنَهُ  (And verily, it is Allah Who indeed is the Best of those who make provision. Truly, He will make them enter an entrance with which they shall be well-pleased,) This means Paradise, as Allah says elsewhere:  فَأَمَّآ إِن كَانَ مِنَ الْمُقَرَّبِينَ - فَرَوْحٌ وَرَيْحَانٌ وَجَنَّـتُ نَعِيمٍ  (Then, if he be of those brought near (to Allah), rest and provision, and a Garden of Delights.) 56:88-89. Allah tells us that He will grant him rest and provision and a Garden of Delights, as He tells us here:  لَيَرْزُقَنَّهُمُ اللَّهُ رِزْقاً حَسَناً  (surely, Allah will provide a good provision for them.) Then He says:  لَيُدْخِلَنَّهُمْ مُّدْخَلاً يَرْضَوْنَهُ وَإِنَّ اللَّهَ لَعَلِيمٌ  (Truly, He will make them enter an entrance with which they shall be well-pleased, and verily, Allah indeed is All-Knowing,) meaning, He is All-Knowing about those who migrate and strive in Jihad for His sake and who deserve that (reward).  حَلِيمٌ  (Most Forbearing,) means, He forgives and overlooks their sins, and He accepts as expiation for their sins, their migration (Hijrah) and their putting their trust in Him. Concerning those who are killed for the sake of Allah, whether they are Muhajirs (migrants) or otherwise, they are alive with their Lord and are being provided for, as Allah says:  وَلاَ تَحْسَبَنَّ الَّذِينَ قُتِلُواْ فِى سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ أَمْوَتاً بَلْ أَحْيَاءٌ عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ يُرْزَقُونَ  (Think not of those as dead who are killed in the way of Allah. Nay, they are alive, with their Lord, and they have provision) 3:169. There are many Hadiths on this topic, as stated previously. With regard to those who die for the sake of Allah, whether they are emigrants or not. This Ayah and the Sahih Hadiths guarantee that they will be well provided for and that Allah will show them kindness. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Shurahbil bin As-Simt said: \"We spent a long time besieging a stronghold in the land of the Romans. Salman Al-Farisi, may Allah be pleased with him, passed by me and said, `I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ say:  «مَنْ مَاتَ مُرَابِطًا أَجْرَى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ مِثْلَ ذَلِكَ الْأَجْرِ، وَأَجْرَى عَلَيْهِ الرِّزْقَ، وَأَمِنَ مِنَ الفَتَّانِينَ، وَاقْرَؤُوا إِنْ شِئْتُمْ:  وَالَّذِينَ هَاجَرُواْ فِى سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ ثُمَّ قُتِلُواْ أَوْ مَاتُواْ لَيَرْزُقَنَّهُمُ اللَّهُ رِزْقاً حَسَناً وَإِنَّ اللَّهَ لَهُوَ خَيْرُ الرَزِقِينَ - لَيُدْخِلَنَّهُمْ مُّدْخَلاً يَرْضَوْنَهُ وَإِنَّ اللَّهَ لَعَلِيمٌ حَلِيمٌ »  (Whoever dies guarding the borders of Islam, Allah will give him a reward like that reward (of martyr) and will provide for him and keep him safe from trials. Recite, if you wish: (Those who emigrated in the cause of Allah and after that were killed or died, surely, Allah will provide a good provision for them. And verily, it is Allah Who indeed is the Best of those who make provision. Truly, He will make them enter an entrance with which they shall be well-pleased, and verily, Allah indeed is All-Knowing, Most Forbearing))\" He also recorded that `Abdur-Rahman bin Jahdam Al-Khawlani was with Fadalah bin `Ubayd when they accompanied with two funerals, at (an island of) sea one of whom had been struck by a catapult, and the other had passed away. Fadalah bin `Ubayd sat by the grave of the man who had passed away and someone said to him, \"Are you neglecting the martyr and not sitting by his grave\" He said, \"I would not mind which of these two graves Allah would resurrect me from, for Allah says:  وَالَّذِينَ هَاجَرُواْ فِى سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ ثُمَّ قُتِلُواْ أَوْ مَاتُواْ لَيَرْزُقَنَّهُمُ اللَّهُ رِزْقاً حَسَناً  (Those who emigrated in the cause of Allah and after that were killed or died, surely, Allah will provide a good provision for them.)\" And he recited these two Ayat, then said, \"What should I seek, O you servant, if I were to enter an entrance to His pleasure, and be provided good provisions By Allah, I would not mind which of these two graves Allah would resurrect me from.\"  ذلِكَ وَمَنْ عَاقَبَ بِمِثْلِ مَا عُوقِبَ بِهِ  (That is so. And whoever has retaliated with the like of that which he was made to suffer....) Muqatil bin Hayan and Ibn Jurayj mentioned that this was revealed about a skirmish in which the Companions encountered some of the idolators. The Muslims urged them not to fight during the Sacred Months, but the idolators insisted on fighting and initiated the aggression. So the Muslims fought them and Allah granted them victory.  إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَعَفُوٌّ غَفُورٌ  (Verily, Allah indeed is Oft-Pardoning, Oft-Forgiving.) "

  22,62,"<h2>The Creator and Controller of this World is Allah</h2> Allah tells us that He is the Creator Who directs the affairs of His creation as He wills. He tells us: ﴾قُلِ اللَّهُمَّ مَـلِكَ الْمُلْكِ تُؤْتِى الْمُلْكَ مَن تَشَآءُ وَتَنزِعُ الْمُلْكَ مِمَّن تَشَآءُ وَتُعِزُّ مَن تَشَآءُ وَتُذِلُّ مَن تَشَآءُ بِيَدِكَ الْخَيْرُ إِنَّكَ عَلَى كُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدِيرٌ - تُولِجُ الَّيْلَ فِى الْنَّهَارِ وَتُولِجُ النَّهَارَ فِى الَّيْلِ وَتُخْرِجُ الْحَىَّ مِنَ الْمَيِّتِ وَتُخْرِجُ الَمَيِّتَ مِنَ الْحَىِّ وَتَرْزُقُ مَن تَشَآءُ بِغَيْرِ حِسَابٍ ﴿ (Say: \"O Allah! Possessor of the power, You give power to whom You will, and You take power from whom You will, and You endue with honor whom You will, and You humiliate whom You will. In Your Hand is the good. Verily, You are able to do all things. You make the night to enter into the day, and You make the day to enter into the night, You bring the living out of the dead, and You bring the dead out of the living. And You give wealth and sustenance to whom You will, without limit.) 3:26-27 The meaning of \"merging\" the night into the day and the day into the night is that the one encroaches upon the other, and vice versa. Sometimes the night is long and the day is short, as in winter, and sometimes the day is long and the night is short, as in summer. ﴾وَأَنَّ اللَّهَ سَمِيعٌ بَصِيرٌ﴿ (And verily, Allah is All-Hearer, All-Seer.) He hears what His servants say, and He sees them, nothing about them or their movement is hidden from Him whatsoever. When Allah tells us that He is controlling the affairs of all that exists, and that He judges, and there is none to reverse His judgement, He says: ﴾ذلِكَ بِأَنَّ اللَّهَ هُوَ الْحَقُّ﴿ (That is because Allah -- He is the Truth,) meaning, the true God, besides Whom no one deserves worship. He is the Possessor of the greatest sovereignty; whatever He wills happens and whatever He does not will does not happen. Everything is in need of Him and submits to Him. ﴾وَأَنَّ مَا يَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِهِ هُوَ الْبَـطِلُ﴿ (and what they invoke besides Him, it is false.) meaning, the idols and false gods. Everything that is worshipped instead of Him -- may He be exalted -- is false, because it can neither bring benefit nor cause harm. ﴾وَأَنَّ اللَّهَ هُوَ الْعَلِىُّ الْكَبِيرُ﴿ (And verily, Allah -- He is the Most High, the Most Great.) This is like the Ayat: ﴾وَهُوَ الْعَلِىُّ الْعَظِيمُ﴿ (and He is the Most High, the Most Great) 42:4 ﴾الْكَبِيرُ الْمُتَعَالِ﴿ (the Most Great, the Most High) 13:9. Everything is subject to His might and power; there is no God except Him and no Lord besides Him, because He is the Almighty and there is none mightier than He, the Most High and there is none higher than He, the Most Great and there is none greater than He. Exalted, sanctified, and glorified be He far above all that the evildoers say. "
