  79,26,"<h2>Mentioning the Story of Musa and that it is a Lesson for Those Who fear Allah</h2> Allah informs His Messenger Muhammad ﷺ about His Messenger Musa. He mentions that he sent Musa to Fir`awn and He aided him with miracles. Yet, even after this, Fir`awn continued in his disbelief and transgression until Allah seized him with a mighty and powerful punishment. Thus is the punishment of whoever opposes you (Muhammad ﷺ) and rejects that which you have been sent with. This is why Allah says at the end of the story,  إِنَّ فِى ذَلِكَ لَعِبْرَةً لِّمَن يَخْشَى  (In this is a Lesson for whoever fears.) Allah begins by saying,  هَلْ أَتَاكَ حَدِيثُ مُوسَى  (Has there come to you the story of Musa) meaning, have you heard of his story  إِذْ نَادَاهُ رَبُّهُ  (When his Lord called him) meaning, He called out speaking to him.  بِالْوَادِ الْمُقَدَّسِ  (in the holy valley) meaning purified  طُوًى  (Tuwa) According to what is correct, it is the name of a valley, as preceded in Surah Ta Ha. So, He said to him:  اذْهَبْ إِلَى فِرْعَوْنَ إِنَّهُ طَغَى  (Go to Fir`awn; verily, he has transgressed all bounds.) meaning, he has become haughty, rebellious and arrogant.  فَقُلْ هَل لَّكَ إِلَى أَن تَزَكَّى  (And say to him: \"Would you purify yourself\") meaning, say to him, \"Will you respond to the path and way that will purify you\" This means, `will you submit (accept Islam) and be obedient'  وَأَهْدِيَكَ إِلَى رَبِّكَ  (And that I guide to your Lord,) meaning, `I will guide you to the worship of your Lord.'  فَتَخْشَى  (so that you fear) meaning, `so that your heart will become humble, obedient, and submissive to Him after it was hard, evil, and far away from goodness.'  فَأَرَاهُ الاٌّيَةَ الْكُبْرَى  (Then he showed him the great sign.) This means that Musa showed him -- along with this truthful call -- a strong evidence and a clear proof of the truthfulness of what he had come up with from Allah.  فَكَذَّبَ وَعَصَى  (But he denied and disobeyed.) meaning, he (Fir`awn) rejected the truth and opposed what Musa commanded him with of obedience. So what happened with him was that his heart disbelieved, and Musa (i.e., his call) could not internally or externally affect it. Along with this, his knowledge that what Musa had come to him with was the truth, did not necessitate his being a believer in it. This is because recognition is the knowledge of the heart, and faith is its action. And it (faith) is to comply with the truth and submit to it. Concerning Allah's statement,  ثُمَّ أَدْبَرَ يَسْعَى  (Then he turned back, striving.) meaning, in responding to the truth with falsehood. This was by his gathering the group of magicians in order to confront that which Musa had come up with of spectacular miracles.  فَحَشَرَ فَنَادَى  (So he gathered (his people) and called out) meaning, among his people.  فَقَالَ أَنَاْ رَبُّكُمُ الاٌّعْلَى  (Saying; I am your lord, most high.\") Ibn `Abbas and Mujahid both said, \"This is the word which Fir`awn said after he said,  مَا عَلِمْتُ لَكُمْ مِّنْ إِلَـهٍ غَيْرِى  (`I have not known of any other god for you all other than me) for the past forty years.\"' Allah then says,  فَأَخَذَهُ اللَّهُ نَكَالَ الاٌّخِرَةِ وَالاٍّوْلَى  (So Allah seized him with a punishing example for the Hereafter and the first (life). ) meaning, Allah avenged Himself against him with a severe vengeance, and He made an example and admonition of him for those rebellious people in the world who are like him.  وَيَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ بِئْسَ الرِّفْدُ الْمَرْفُودُ  (And on the Day of Resurrection, evil indeed is the gift gifted i.e., the curse (in this world) pursued by another curse (in this world) pursued by another curse (in the Hereafter).) (11:99) This is as Allah says,  وَجَعَلْنَـهُمْ أَئِمَّةً يَدْعُونَ إِلَى النَّارِ وَيَوْمَ الْقِيـمَةِ لاَ يُنصَرُونَ  (And We made them leaders inviting to the Fire: and on the Day of Resurrection, they will not be helped.) (28:41) Allah said;  إِنَّ فِى ذَلِكَ لَعِبْرَةً لِّمَن يَخْشَى  (In this is a lesson for whoever fears.) "

  79,33,"<h2>Creating the Heavens and the Earth is more difficult than repeating Creation</h2> in refutation of the claim rejecting resurrection due to the renewal of creation after its original state, Allah says; ﴾ءَأَنتُمْ﴿ (Are you) `O people' ﴾أَشَدُّ خَلْقاً أَمِ السَّمَآءُ﴿ (more difficult to create or is the heaven...) meaning, `rather the heaven is more difficult to create than you.' As Allah said; ﴾لَخَلْقُ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ أَكْـبَرُ مِنْ خَلْقِ النَّاسِ﴿ (the creation of the heavens and the earth is greater than the creation of mankind;) (40:57) And His saying; ﴾أَوَلَـيْسَ الَذِى خَلَقَ السَّمَـوتِ وَالاٌّرْضَ بِقَـدِرٍ عَلَى أَن يَخْلُقَ مِثْلَهُم بَلَى وَهُوَ الْخَلَّـقُ الْعَلِيمُ ﴿ (Is not the One Who created the heavens and the earth, capable of creating the similar to them. Yes, indeed! He is the Supreme Creator, the All-Knowing.) (36:81) Then Allah says, ﴾بَنَـهَا﴿ (He constructed) He explains this by His statement, ﴾رَفَعَ سَمْكَهَا فَسَوَّاهَا ﴿ (He raised its height, and has perfected it.) meaning, He made it a lofty structure, vast in its space, with equal sides, and adorned with stars at night and in the darkness. Then Allah says, ﴾وَأَغْطَشَ لَيْلَهَا وَأَخْرَجَ ضُحَـهَا ﴿ (Its night He covers and He brings out its forenoon.) meaning, He made its night dark and extremely black, and its day bright, luminous, shining and clear. Ibn `Abbas said, \"He did Aghtasha of its night means that He made it dark.\" Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr and a large group have said this as well. In reference to Allah's statement, ﴾وَأَخْرَجَ ضُحَـهَا﴿ (And He brings out its forenoon.) meaning, He illuminated its day. Then Allah says, ﴾وَالاٌّرْضَ بَعْدَ ذَلِكَ دَحَـهَا ﴿ (And after that He spread the earth,) He explains this statement by the statement that follows it, ﴾أَخْرَجَ مِنْهَا مَآءَهَا وَمَرْعَـهَا ﴿ (And brought forth therefrom its water and its pasture.) It already has been mentioned previously in Surat Ha Mim As-Sajdah that the earth was created before the heaven was created, but it was only spread out after the creation of the heaven. This means that He brought out what was in it with a forceful action. This is the meaning of what was said by Ibn `Abbas and others, and it was the explanation preferred by Ibn Jarir. In reference to the statement of Allah, ﴾وَالْجِبَالَ أَرْسَـهَا ﴿ (And the mountains He has fixed firmly,) meaning, He settled them, made them firm, and established them in their places. And He is the Most Wise, the All-Knowing. He is Most Kind to His creation, Most Merciful. Allah then says, ﴾مَتَـعاً لَّكُمْ وَلاًّنْعَـمِكُمْ ﴿ (As provision and benefit for you and your cattle.) meaning, He spread out the earth, caused its springs to gush forth, brought forth its hidden benefits, caused its rivers to flow, and caused its vegetation, trees, and fruits to grow. He also made its mountains firm so that it (the earth) would be calmly settled with its dwellers, and He stabilized its dwelling places. All of this is a means of beneficial enjoyment for His creatures (mankind) providing them of what cattle they need, which they eat and ride upon. He has granted them these beneficial things for the period that they need them, in this worldly abode, until the end of time and the expiration of this life. "

  79,46,"<h2>The Day of Judgement, its Pleasures and Hell, and that its Time is not known</h2> Allah says,  فَإِذَا جَآءَتِ الطَّآمَّةُ الْكُبْرَى  (But when there comes the Great Catastrophe) This refers to the Day of Judgement. This has been said by Ibn `Abbas. It has been called this because it will overcome every matter. It will be frightful and horrifying. As Allah says,  وَالسَّاعَةُ أَدْهَى وَأَمَرُّ  (And the Hour will be more grievous and more bitter.) (54:46) Then Allah says,  يَوْمَ يَتَذَكَّرُ الإِنسَـنُ مَا سَعَى  (The Day when man shall remember what he strove for.) meaning, at that time the Son of Adam will reflect upon all of his deeds, both the good and the evil. This is as Allah says,  يَوْمَئِذٍ يَتَذَكَّرُ الإِنسَـنُ وَأَنَّى لَهُ الذِّكْرَى  (On the Day will man remember, but how will that remembrance avail him) (89:23) Then Allah says,  وَبُرِّزَتِ الْجَحِيمُ لِمَن يَرَى  (And Hell shall be made apparent for whoever sees.) meaning, it will become apparent for the onlookers, so the people will see it with their own eyes.  فَأَمَّا مَن طَغَى  (Then for him who transgressed) meaning, who rebels and behaves arrogantly.  وَءاثَرَ الْحَيَوةَ الدُّنْيَا  (And preferred the life of this world,) meaning, he gives it precedence over the matters of his religion and his Hereafter.  فَإِنَّ الْجَحِيمَ هِىَ الْمَأْوَى  (Verily his abode will be the Hell;) meaning, his final destination will be Hell, his food will be from the tree of Zaqqum, and his drink will be from Hamim.  وَأَمَّا مَنْ خَافَ مَقَامَ رَبِّهِ وَنَهَى النَّفْسَ عَنِ الْهَوَى  (But as for him who feared standing before his Lord and forbade himself from desire.) meaning, he fears the standing before Allah, he fears Allah's judgement of him, he prevents his soul from following its desires, and he compels it to obey its Master.  فَإِنَّ الْجَنَّةَ هِىَ الْمَأْوَى  (Verily Paradise will be his abode.) meaning, his final abode, his destination, and his place of return will be the spacious Paradise. Then Allah says,  يَسْأَلُونَكَ عَنِ السَّاعَةِ أَيَّانَ مُرْسَـهَا - فِيمَ أَنتَ مِن ذِكْرَاهَا - إِلَى رَبِّكَ مُنتَهَـهَآ  (They ask you about the Hour -- when will be its appointed time What do you have to mention of it. To your Lord it is limited.) meaning, its knowledge is not with you, nor with any creature. Rather the knowledge of it is with Allah. He is the One Who knows the exact time of its occurrence.  ثَقُلَتْ فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ لاَ تَأْتِيكُمْ إِلاَّ بَغْتَةً يَسْـَلُونَكَ كَأَنَّكَ حَفِىٌّ عَنْهَا قُلْ إِنَّمَا عِلْمُهَا عِندَ اللَّهِ  (Heavy is its burden through the heavens and the earth. It shall not come upon you except all of a sudden. They ask you as if you have a good knowledge of it. Say: \"The knowledge thereof is with Allah.\") (7:187) Allah says here,  إِلَى رَبِّكَ مُنتَهَـهَآ  (To your Lord it is limited.) Thus, when Jibril asked the Messenger of Allah ﷺ about the time of the last Hour he said,  «مَا الْمَسْؤُولُ عَنْهَا بِأَعْلَمَ مِنَ السَّائِل»  (The one questioned about it knows no more than the questioner.) Allah said,  إِنَّمَآ أَنتَ مُنذِرُ مَن يَخْشَـهَا  (You are only a warner for those who fear it,) meaning, `I sent you to warn mankind and caution them to beware of the torment and punishment of Allah. So whoever fears Allah, fears standing before Him, and His threat, then he will follow you, and thus be successful and victorious. However, whoever denies you and opposes you, then he will only suffer loss and failure.' Allah then says,  كَأَنَّهُمْ يَوْمَ يَرَوْنَهَا لَمْ يَلْبَثُواْ إِلاَّ عَشِيَّةً أَوْ ضُحَـهَا  (The Day they see it (it will be) as if they had not tarried (in this world) except an (`Ashiyyah) afternoon or its (Duha) morning.) meaning, when they stand up from their graves to go to the place of Gathering, they will feel that the period of the worldy life was short, it will seem to them that it was only the afternoon of one day. Juwaybir reported from Ad-Dahhak from Ibn `Abbas:  كَأَنَّهُمْ يَوْمَ يَرَوْنَهَا لَمْ يَلْبَثُواْ إِلاَّ عَشِيَّةً أَوْ ضُحَـهَا  (The Day they see it (it will be) as if they had not tarried (in this world) except an (`Ashiyyah) afternoon or its (Duha) morning.) \"As for `Ashiyyah, it is the time between noon until the setting of the sun.  أَوْ ضُحَـهَا  (Or its (Duha) morning) what is between sunrise and midday (noon).\" Qatadah said, \"This refers to the time period of the worldly life in the eyes of the people when they see the Hereafter.\" This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat An-Nazi`at. And to Allah belongs all praise and thanks. "
