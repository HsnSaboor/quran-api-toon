  14,43,"<h2>Allah gives Respite to the Disbelievers and is never unaware of what They do</h2> Allah says, `O Muhammad, do not think that Allah is unaware of what the unjust disbelievers do. Do not think because Allah gave them respite and delayed their punishment that He is unaware or ignoring punishing them for what they do. Rather, Allah keeps full account of this for them and keeps it on record against them, ﴾إِنَّمَا يُؤَخِّرُهُمْ لِيَوْمٍ تَشْخَصُ فِيهِ الأَبْصَـرُ﴿ (but He gives them respite up to a Day when the eyes will stare in horror.) from the horror of the Day of Resurrection.' Allah next mentions how they will all be raised up from their graves and hurriedly gathered for the Day of Gathering, ﴾مُهْطِعِينَ﴿ (hastening forward), in a hurry. Allah said in other Ayat, ﴾مُّهْطِعِينَ إِلَى الدَّاعِ﴿ (Hastening towards the caller.) 54:8 ﴾يَوْمَئِذٍ يَتَّبِعُونَ الدَّاعِىَ لاَ عِوَجَ لَهُ﴿ (On that Day mankind will follow strictly Allah's caller, no crookedness will they show him.) 20:108 until, ﴾وَعَنَتِ الْوُجُوهُ لِلْحَىِّ الْقَيُّومِ﴿ (And (all) faces shall be humbled before the Ever Living, the Sustainer.) 20:111 Allah said: another Ayah, ﴾يَوْمَ يَخْرُجُونَ مِنَ الاٌّجْدَاثِ سِرَاعاً﴿ (The Day when they will come out of the graves quickly.) 70:43 Allah said next, ﴾مُقْنِعِى رُءُوسِهِمْ﴿ (with necks outstretched) meaning, raising their heads up, according to Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid and several others. Allah said next, ﴾لاَ يَرْتَدُّ إِلَيْهِمْ طَرْفُهُمْ﴿ (their gaze returning not towards them) meaning, their eyes are staring in confusion, trying not to blink because of the horror and tremendous insights they are experiencing, and fear of what is going to strike them, we seek refuge with Allah from this end. This is why Allah said, ﴾وَأَفْئِدَتُهُمْ هَوَآءٌ﴿ (and their hearts empty.) meaning, their hearts are empty due to extreme fear and fright. Qatadah and several others said that the places of their hearts are empty then, because the hearts will ascend to the throats due to extreme fear. Allah said next to His Messenger , "

  14,46,"<h2>There will be no Respite after the Coming of the Torment</h2> Allah mentions what those who committed injustice against themselves will say when they witness the torment, ﴾رَبَّنَآ أَخِّرْنَآ إِلَى أَجَلٍ قَرِيبٍ نُّجِبْ دَعْوَتَكَ وَنَتَّبِعِ الرُّسُلَ﴿ (Our Lord! Respite us for a little while, we will answer Your call and follow the Messengers!) Allah said in other Ayat, ﴾حَتَّى إِذَا جَآءَ أَحَدَهُمُ الْمَوْتُ قَالَ رَبِّ ارْجِعُونِ ﴿ (Until, when death comes to one of them, he says: \"My Lord! Send me back.\")23:99 and, ﴾يأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ لاَ تُلْهِكُمْ أَمْوَلُكُمْ﴿ (O you who believe! Let not your properties divert you.) 63:9-10 Allah described the condition of the wrongdoers on the Day of Gathering, when He said, ﴾وَلَوْ تَرَى إِذِ الْمُجْرِمُونَ نَاكِسُواْ رُءُوسِهِمْ﴿ (And if you only could see when the criminals shall hang their heads.) 32:12, ﴾وَلَوْ تَرَى إِذْ وُقِفُواْ عَلَى النَّارِ فَقَالُواْ يلَيْتَنَا نُرَدُّ وَلاَ نُكَذِّبَ بِـَايَـتِ رَبِّنَا﴿ (If you could but see when they will be held over the Fire! They will say: \"Would that we were but sent back (to the world)! Then we would not deny the Ayat of Our Lord. ..\"!) 6:27 and, ﴾وَهُمْ يَصْطَرِخُونَ فِيهَا﴿ (Therein they will cry.) 35:27 Allah refuted their statement here, ﴾أَوَلَمْ تَكُونُواْ أَقْسَمْتُمْ مِّن قَبْلُ مَا لَكُمْ مِّن زَوَالٍ﴿ (Had you not sworn aforetime that you would not leave.) Allah says, `Had you not vowed before, that your previous state will not change, that there will be no Resurrection or Reckoning Therefore, taste this torment because of what you vowed before.' Mujahid commented that, ﴾مَا لَكُمْ مِّن زَوَالٍ﴿ (that you would not leave.) refers to leaving this worldly life to the Hereafter. Allah also said, ﴾وَأَقْسَمُواْ بِاللَّهِ جَهْدَ أَيْمَـنِهِمْ لاَ يَبْعَثُ اللَّهُ مَن يَمُوتُ﴿ (And they swear by Allah with their strongest oaths, that Allah will not raise up him who dies.) 16:38 Allah said next, ﴾وَسَكَنتُمْ فِى مَسَـكِنِ الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ أَنفُسَهُمْ وَتَبَيَّنَ لَكُمْ كَيْفَ فَعَلْنَا بِهِمْ وَضَرَبْنَا لَكُمُ الأَمْثَالَ ﴿ (And you dwelt in the dwellings of men who wronged themselves, and it was clear to you how We had dealt with them. And We put forth (many) parables for you.) Allah says, `you have witnessed or heard of the news of what happened to the earlier disbelieving nations, but you did not draw a lesson from their end, nor did what We punished them with provide an example for you,' ﴾حِكْمَةٌ بَـلِغَةٌ فَمَا تُغْنِـى النُّذُرُ ﴿ (Perfect wisdom but the warners benefit then not.)54:5 Shu`bah narrated that Abu Ishaq said that `Abdur-Rahman bin Dabil said that `Ali bin Abi Talib commented on Allah's statement, ﴾وَإِن كَانَ مَكْرُهُمْ لِتَزُولَ مِنْهُ الْجِبَالُ﴿ (though their plot was not such as to remove the mountains from their places.) \"He who disputed with Ibrahim about his Lord, took two eaglets and raised them until they became adult eagels. Then he tied each eagel's leg to a wooden box with ropes and left them go hungry. He and another man sat inside the wooden box and raised a staff with a piece of meat on its tip. So, the two eagles started flying. The king asked his companion to tell him what he was seeing, and he described the scenes to him, until he said that he saw the earth as a fly. So, the king brought the staff closer to the eagels and they started landing slowly. This is why Allah said, (وَإِنْ كَادَ مَكْرُهُمْ لِتَزُولَ مِنْهُ الْجِبَالُ) `though their plot was hardly one to remove the mountains from their places.\"' Mujahid also mentioned that this story was about Nebuchadnezzar, and that when the king's sight was far away from earth and its people, he was called, `O tyrant one! Where are you headed to' He became afraid and brought the staff closer to the eagels, which flew faster with such haste that the mountains almost shook from the noise they made. The mountains were almost moved from their places, so Allah said, ﴾وَإِن كَانَ مَكْرُهُمْ لِتَزُولَ مِنْهُ الْجِبَالُ﴿ (though their plot was not such as to remove the mountains from their places.)\" Ibn Jurayj narrated that Mujahid recited this Ayah in a way that means, \"though their plot was such as to remove the mountains from their places.\" However, Al-`Awfi reported that Ibn `Abbas said that, ﴾وَإِن كَانَ مَكْرُهُمْ لِتَزُولَ مِنْهُ الْجِبَالُ﴿ (though their plot was not such as to remove the mountains from their places.) indicates that their plot was not such as to remove the mountains from their places. Similar was said by Al-Hasan Al-Basri. Ibn Jarir reasoned that, \"Associating others with Allah and disbelieving in Him, which they brought upon themselves, did not bother the mountains nor other creatures. Rather, the harm of their actions came to haunt them.\" I (Ibn Kathir) said, this meaning is similar to Allah's statement, ﴾وَلاَ تَمْشِ فِى الاٌّرْضِ مَرَحًا إِنَّكَ لَن تَخْرِقَ الاٌّرْضَ وَلَن تَبْلُغَ الْجِبَالَ طُولاً ﴿ (And walk not on the earth with conceit and arrogance. Verily, you can neither rend nor penetrate the earth, nor can you attain a stature like the mountains in height.)17:37 There is another way of explaining this Ayah; `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas said that, ﴾وَإِن كَانَ مَكْرُهُمْ لِتَزُولَ مِنْهُ الْجِبَالُ﴿ (though their plot was not such as to remove the mountains from their places.) refers to their Shirk, for Allah said in another Ayah, ﴾تَكَادُ السَّمَـوَتُ يَتَفَطَّرْنَ مِنْهُ﴿ (Whereby the heavens are almost torn.) 19:90 Ad-Dahhak and Qatadah said similarly.

  14,48,"<h2>Allah never breaks a Promise</h2> فَلاَ تَحْسَبَنَّ اللَّهَ مُخْلِفَ وَعْدِهِ رُسُلَهُ  (So think not that Allah will fail to keep His promise to His Messengers.) His promise to grant them victory in this life and on the Day when the Witnesses shall come forth. Allah affirms that He is All-Able and that nothing He wills escapes His power and none can resist Him. Allah affirms that He is Able to exact retribution from those who disbelieve in Him and deny Him,  وَيْلٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ لِّلْمُكَذِّبِينَ  (Woe that Day to the deniers!)77:15 Allah said here,  يَوْمَ تُبَدَّلُ الاٌّرْضُ غَيْرَ الاٌّرْضِ وَالسَّمَـوَتُ  (On the Day when the earth will be changed to another earth and so will be the heavens,) meaning, His promise shall come to pass on the Day when the earth will be changed to an earth other than this earth that we know and recognize. It is recorded in the Two Sahihs that Sahl bin Sa`d said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,  «يُحْشَرُ النَّاسُ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ عَلَى أَرْضٍ بَيْضَاءَ عَفْرَاءَ كَقُرْصَةِ النَّقِيِّ لَيْسَ فِيهَا مَعْلَمٌ لِأَحَد»  (On the Day of Resurrection, the people will be gathered on a white (barren), flat earth just like the wheat bread, it has no recognizable features for anyone.) Imam Ahmad recorded that `A'ishah said, \"I was the first among all people who asked the Messenger of Allah ﷺ about this Ayah,  يَوْمَ تُبَدَّلُ الاٌّرْضُ غَيْرَ الاٌّرْضِ وَالسَّمَـوَتُ  (On the Day when the earth will be changed to another earth and so will be the heavens,) saying, `O Allah's Messenger! Where will the people be then' He said,  «عَلَى الصِّرَاط»  (On the Sirat.)\" Muslim, but not Al-Bukhari, collected this Hadith. At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah also recorded it, and At-Tirmidhi said \"Hasan Sahih\". Imam Muslim bin Al-Hajjaj recorded in his Sahih that Thawban the servant of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said, \"I was standing next to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ when a Jewish rabbi came to him and said, `Peace be to you, O Muhammad.' I pushed him with such a force that almost caused him to fall down and he asked me why I did that. I said, `Why did you not say, `O Messenger of Allah' The Jew said, `We call him by the name which his family gave him.' The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,  «إِنَّ اسْمِي مُحَمَّدٌ الَّذِي سَمَّانِي بِهِ أهْلِي»  (Muhammad is indeed the name which my family gave me.) The Jew said, `I came to ask you about something.' The Messenger of Allah ﷺ replied,  «أَيَنْفَعُكَ شَيْئًا إِنْ حَدَّثْتُكَ؟»  (Would it benefit you if I replied to your question) He said, `I will hear it with my ear.' The Messenger of Allah ﷺ poked the ground with a staff he had and said,  «سَل»  (Ask.) The Jew said, `Where will the people be when the earth will be changed to another earth and so will the heavens' The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,  «هُمْ فِي الظُّلْمَةِ دُونَ الْجَسْر»  قال: فمن أول الناس إجازة؟ فقال:  «فُقَرَاءُ الْمُهَاجِرِين»  ، فقال اليهودي: فما تحفتهم حين يدخلون الجنة؟ قال:  «زِيَادَةُ كَبِدِ النُّون»  قال: فما غذاؤهم في إثرها؟ قال:  «يُنْحَرُ لَهُمْ ثَوْرُ الْجَنَّةِ الَّذِي كَانَ يَأْكُلُ مِنْ أَطْرَافِهَا»  قال: فما شرابهم عليه؟ قال:  «مِنْ عَيْنٍ فِيهَا تُسَمَّى سَلْسَبِيلًا»  . قال: صدقت، قال: وجئت أسألك عن شيء لا يعلمه أحد من أهل الأرض إلا نبي أو رجل أو رجلان. قال:  «أَيَنْفَعُكَ إِنْ حَدَّثْتُكَ؟»  قال: أسمع بأذني. قال: جئت أسألك عن الولد، قال:  «مَاءُ الرُّجُلِ أَبْيَضُ، وَمَاءُ الْمَرْأَةِ أَصْفَرُ، فَإِذَا اجْتَمَعَا فَعَلَا مَنِيُّ الرُّجُلِ مَنِيَّ الْمَرْأَةِ، أَذْكَرَا بِإِذْنِ اللهِ تَعَالَى، وَإِذَا عَلَا مَنِيُّ الْمَرْأَةِ مَنِيَّ الرَّجُلِ، أَنَّثَا بِإِذْنِ الله»  قال اليهودي: لقد صدقت وإنك لنبي ثم انصرف، فقال رسول اللهصلى الله عليه وسلّم:  «لَقَدْ سَأَلَنِي هَذَا عَنِ الَّذِي سَأَلَنِي عَنْهُ، وَمَا لِي عِلْمٌ بِشَيْءٍ مِنْهُ حَتَّى أَتَانِي اللهُ بِه»  (In the darkness before the Bridge (Jasr).) He asked, `Who will be the first to pass it' He said, (The poor emigrants (Muhajirin).) He asked, `What will their (refreshment) be when they enter Paradise' He said, (The caul of fish liver.) He asked, `What will they have after that' He said, (A bull of Paradise which grazed through its pathways will be slaughtered for them.) He asked, `From what will they drink' He said, (From a fountain whose name is Salsabil. ) He said, `You have said the truth. I have come to ask you something about which none of the inhabitants of the earth knows, with the exception of a Prophet or one or two other men.' He said, (Would you benefit by me informing you about it) He replied, `I would listen. I have come to ask you about the child.' He said, (The fluid of the man is white, and the woman's is yellow. When they meet, if the discharge of the man is greater than that of the woman, then it becomes a male, by Allah's permission. When the womans discharge is greater than the man's, it becomes a female by Allah's permission.) The Jew said, `You have told the truth and are indeed a Prophet.' Then he left. So Allah's Messenger ﷺ said; (He asked me such things that I had no knowledge of it until Allah gave it to me.) Allah said next,  وَبَرَزُواْ للَّهِ  (and they will appear before Allah), describing when the creatures will be resurrected before Allah from their graves,  الْوَاحِدُ الْقَهَّارُ  (the One, the Irresisti- ble.) Who has full power and control over all things and to Whom the necks and minds are subservient. "

  14,51,"<h2>The Condition of the criminals on the Day of Resurrection</h2> Allah said,  يَوْمَ تُبَدَّلُ الاٌّرْضُ غَيْرَ الاٌّرْضِ وَالسَّمَـوَتُ  (On the Day when the earth will be changed to another earth and so will be the heavens) `and the creations will be brought before their Lord, and you, O Muhammad, will witness the criminals who committed the crimes of Kufr and mischief,'  مُقْرِنِينَ  (Muqarranin) bound together, each with his or her like, just as Allah said,  احْشُرُواْ الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ وَأَزْوَجَهُمْ  (Assemble those who did wrong, together with their companions.) 37:22  وَإِذَا النُّفُوسُ زُوِّجَتْ  (And when the souls are joined with their bodies.)81:7,  وَإَذَآ أُلْقُواْ مِنْهَا مَكَاناً ضَيِّقاً مُّقَرَّنِينَ دَعَوْاْ هُنَالِكَ ثُبُوراً  (And when they shall be thrown into a narrow place thereof, chained together, they will exclaim therein for destruction.) 25:13 and,  وَالشَّيَـطِينَ كُلَّ بَنَّآءٍ وَغَوَّاصٍ - وَءَاخَرِينَ مُقَرَّنِينَ فِى الاٌّصْفَادِ  (And also the Shayatin from the Jinn (including) every kind of builder and diver, and also others bound in fetters.)38:37-38 Allah said next,  سَرَابِيلُهُم مِّن قَطِرَانٍ  (Their garments will be of Qatiran (pitch),) that is used to coat camels. Qatadah commented that Qatiran (tar) is one of the fastest objects to catch fire. Ibn `Abbas used to say that the Qatiran, mentioned in the Ayah, is dissolved lead. It is possible that this Ayah reads as: (سَرَابِيلُهُمْ مِنْ قَطِرٍآنٍ) refering to heated lead that has reached tremendous heat, according to Mujahid, Ikrimah, Sa'id bin Jubayr Al-Hasan and Qatadah. Allah said next,  وَتَغْشَى وُجُوهَهُمْ النَّارُ  (and fire will cover their faces), which is similar to His other statement,  تَلْفَحُ وُجُوهَهُمُ النَّارُ وَهُمْ فِيهَا كَـلِحُونَ  (The Fire will burn their faces, and therein they will grin, with displaced lips.)23:104 Imam Ahmad recorded that Yahya bin Abi Ishaq said that Aban bin Yazid said that Yahya bin Abi Kathir said that Zayd bin Abi Salam said that Abu Malik Al-Ash`ari said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,  «أَرْبَعٌ فِي أُمَّتِي مِنْ أَمْرِ الْجَاهِلِيَّةِ لَا يَتْرُكُونَهُنَّ:الْفَخْرُ بِالْأَحْسَابِ، وَالطَّعْنُ فِي الْأَنْسَابِ، وَالْاسْتِسْقَاءُ بِالنُّجُومِ، وَالنِّيَاحَةُ عَلَى الْمَيِّتِ، وَالنَّائِحَةُ إِذَا لَمْ تَتُبْ قَبْلَ مَوْتِهَا، تُقَامُ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ وَعَلَيْهَا سِرْبَالٌ مِنْ قَطِرَانٍ وَدِرْعٌ مِنْ جَرَب»  (Four characteristics from the time of Jahiliyyah will remain in my Ummah, since they will not abandon them: boasting about their family lineage, discrediting family ties, seeking rain through the stars, and wailing for their dead. Verily, if she who wails, dies before she repents from her behavior, she will be resurrected on the Day of Resurrection while wearing a dress of Qatiran and a cloak of mange.) Muslim collected this Hadith. Allah said next,  لِيَجْزِىَ اللَّهُ كُلَّ نَفْسٍ مَّا كَسَبَتْ  (That Allah may requite each person according to what he has earned.) meaning, on the Day of Resurrection. Allah said in another Ayah,  لِيَجْزِىَ الَّذِينَ أَسَاءُواْ بِمَا عَمِلُواْ  (That He may requite those who do evil with that which they have done.) 53:31 Allah said here,  إِنَّ اللَّهَ سَرِيعُ الْحِسَابِ  (Truly, Allah is swift at reckoning.) when He wills to reckon a servants of His, for He knows everything and nothing ever escapes His observation. Verily, His power over all of His creation is the same as His power over one creature,  مَّا خَلْقُكُمْ وَلاَ بَعْثُكُمْ إِلاَّ كَنَفْسٍ وَحِدَةٍ  (The creation of you all and the resurrection of you all are only as a single person. )31:28 And this is why Mujahid said,  سَرِيعُ الْحِسَابِ  (swift at reckoning), means \"keeping count.\" "
  14,52,"<h2>Allah states that this Qur'an is a Message for mankind,</h2>﴾لاٌّنذِرَكُمْ بِهِ وَمَن بَلَغَ﴿ ((So) that I may therewith warn you and whomsoever it may reach.) 6:19 This Qur'an is for all mankind and the Jinns, just as Allah said in the beginning of this Surah, ﴾الر كِتَابٌ أَنزَلْنَـهُ إِلَيْكَ لِتُخْرِجَ النَّاسَ مِنَ الظُّلُمَـتِ إِلَى النُّورِ﴿ (Alif-Lam-Ra. (This is) a Book which We have revealed unto you in order that you might lead mankind out of darkness into light.) 14:1 Allah said next, ﴾وَلِيُنذَرُواْ بِهِ﴿ (in order that they may be warned thereby), or to receive and draw lessons from it, ﴾وَلِيَعْلَمُواْ أَنَّمَا هُوَ إِلَـهٌ وَاحِدٌ﴿ (and that they may know that He is the only One God) using its proofs and evidences that testify that there is no true deity except Allah, ﴾وَلِيَذَّكَّرَ أُوْلُواْ الأَلْبَـبِ﴿ (and that men of understanding may take heed.) meaning those who have good minds. aThis is the end of the Tafsir of Surah Ibrahim, and all praise is due to Allah.
