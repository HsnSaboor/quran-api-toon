tafsir[7]{c,v,t}:
  9,48,"<h2>Allah encourages His Prophet against hypocrites,</h2> لَقَدِ ابْتَغَوُاْ الْفِتْنَةَ مِن قَبْلُ وَقَلَّبُواْ لَكَ الأُمُورَ  (Verily, they had plotted sedition before, and had upset matters for you,) `For a long time,' Allah says, hypocrites thought and plotted against you and your Companions, as well as, failing and attempting to extinguish your religion.' This occurred soon after the Prophet migrated to Al-Madinah, when pagan Arabs joined force and the Jews and hypocrites of Al-Madinah waged war against the Messenger ﷺ. When Allah gave victory to the Prophet in Badr and raised high his word, `Abdullah bin Ubayy and his fellows said, \"This (Islam) is a matter that has prevailed.\" They embraced Islam outwardly, and whenever Allah elevated Islam and its people in might, hypocrites increased in rage and disappointment,  حَتَّى جَآءَ الْحَقُّ وَظَهَرَ أَمْرُ اللَّهِ وَهُمْ كَـرِهُونَ  (until the truth (victory) came and the decree of Allah became manifest though they hated it.) "
  9,49," ائْذَن لِّي  (Grant me leave), to stay behind,  وَلاَ تَفْتِنِّى  (and put me not into trial.), if I go with you and see the women of the Romans. Allah, the Exalted, replied,  أَلا فِى الْفِتْنَةِ سَقَطُواْ  (Surely, they have fallen into trial) because of the statement they uttered. Muhammad bin Ishaq reported from Az-Zuhri, Yazid bin Ruwman, `Abdullah bin Abi Bakr, `Asim bin Qatadah and several others that they said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to Al-Jadd bin Qays from Bani Salimah,  «هَلْ لَكَ يَا جَدُّ الْعَامَ فِي جَلَادِ بَنِي الْأَصْفَرِ؟»  (`Would you like to fight the yellow ones (Romans) this year) He said, `O Allah's Messenger! Give me permission (to remain behind) and do not cause Fitnah for me. By Allah! My people know that there is not a man who is more fond of women than I. I fear that if I see the women of the yellow ones, I would not be patient.' The Messenger of Allah ﷺ turned away from him and said,  «قَدْ أَذِنْتُ لَك»  (I give you permission.) In Al-Jadd's case, this Ayah was revealed,  وَمِنْهُمْ مَّن يَقُولُ ائْذَن لِّي وَلاَ تَفْتِنِّى  (And among them is he who says: \"Grant me leave and put me not into trial.\") Therefore, Allah says that the Fitnah that he fell into because of not joining the Messenger of Allah ﷺ (in Jihad) and preferring his safety to the safety of the Messenger ﷺ is worse than the Fitnah that he falsely claimed to fear.\" It was reported from Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid and several others that this Ayah was revealed in the case of Al-Jadd bin Qays, who was among the chiefs of Bani Salimah. It is also recorded in the Sahih that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ asked,  «مَنْ سَيِّدُكُمْ يَا بَنِي سَلَمَةَ؟»  (Who is your chief, O Bani Salamah) They said, \"Al-Jadd bin Qays, although we consider him a miser.\" The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,  «وَأَيُّ دَاءٍ أَدْوَأُ مِنَ الْبُخْلِ وَلَكِنْ سَيِّدُكُمْ الْفَتَى الْجَعْدُ الْأَبْيَضُ بِشْرُ بْنُ الْبَرَاءِ بْنِ مَعْرُور»  (There is not a disease worse than stinginess! Therefore, your chief is the white young man with curly hair, Bishr bin Al-Bara' bin Ma'rur.) Allah said next,  وَإِنَّ جَهَنَّمَ لَمُحِيطَةٌ بِالْكَـفِرِينَ  (And verily, Hell is surrounding the disbelievers.) and they will never be able to avoid, avert, or escape from it. "

  9,51,"<h2>Allah emphasizes the enmity that the hypocrites have for the Prophet</h2> If a blessing, such as victory and triumph over the enemies, is given to the Prophet , thus pleasing him and his Companions, it grieves the hypocrites,  ﴾وَإِن تُصِبْكَ مُصِيبَةٌ يَقُولُواْ قَدْ أَخَذْنَا أَمْرَنَا مِن قَبْلُ﴿ (but if a calamity overtakes you, they say: \"We took our precaution beforehand,\"), they say, we took precautions when we did not join him,  ﴾وَيَتَوَلَّواْ وَّهُمْ فَرِحُونَ﴿ (and they turn away rejoicing.) Allah directed His Prophet to reply to the perfect enmity they have towards him,  ﴾قُلْ﴿ (Say), to them,  ﴾لَّن يُصِيبَنَآ إِلاَّ مَا كَتَبَ اللَّهُ لَنَا﴿ (Nothing shall ever happen to us except what Allah has ordained for us.) for we are under His control and decree,  ﴾هُوَ مَوْلَـنَا﴿ (He is our Mawla.), Master and protector,  ﴾وَعَلَى اللَّهِ فَلْيَتَوَكَّلِ الْمُؤْمِنُونَ﴿ (And in Allah let the believers put their trust) 9:51, and we trust in Him. Verily, He is sufficient for us and what an excellent guardian.  "

  9,54,"﴾قُلْ﴿ (Say), O Muhammad to them,  ﴾هَلْ تَرَبَّصُونَ بِنَآ﴿ (Do you wait for us), anything,  ﴾إِلاَ إِحْدَى الْحُسْنَيَيْنِ﴿ (except one of the two best things), martyrdom or victory over you, according to the meaning given by Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Qatadah, and others.  ﴾وَنَحْنُ نَتَرَبَّصُ بِكُمْ﴿ (while we await for you), that this will touch you,  ﴾أَن يُصِيبَكُمُ اللَّهُ بِعَذَابٍ مِّنْ عِندِهِ أَوْ بِأَيْدِينَا﴿ (either that Allah will afflict you with a punishment from Himself or at our hands), either capture or killing,  ﴾فَتَرَبَّصُواْ إِنَّا مَعَكُمْ مُّتَرَبِّصُونَ﴿ (So wait, we too are waiting with you.) Allah said next,  ﴾قُلْ أَنفِقُواْ طَوْعاً أَوْ كَرْهاً﴿ (Say: Spend willingly or unwillingly), for whatever you spend either way,  ﴾لَّن يُتَقَبَّلَ مِنكُمْ إِنَّكُمْ كُنتُمْ قَوْماً فَـسِقِينَ﴿ (it will not be accepted from you. Verily, you are ever a people who are rebellious.) Allah mentions the reason behind not accepting their charity from them,  ﴾إِلاَ أَنَّهُمْ كَفَرُواْ بِاللَّهِ وَبِرَسُولِهِ﴿ (except that they disbelieved in Allah and in His Messenger. ) and the deeds are accepted if they are preceded with faith,  ﴾وَلاَ يَأْتُونَ الصَّلَوةَ إِلاَّ وَهُمْ كُسَالَى﴿ (and that they came not to the Salah except in a lazy state.) Therefore, they neither have good intention nor eagerness to perform the acts of faith,  ﴾وَمَا مَنَعَهُمْ أَن تُقْبَلَ مِنْهُمْ نَفَقَـتُهُمْ إِلاَ أَنَّهُمْ كَفَرُواْ بِاللَّهِ وَبِرَسُولِهِ وَلاَ يَأْتُونَ الصَّلَوةَ إِلاَّ وَهُمْ كُسَالَى وَلاَ يُنفِقُونَ إِلاَّ وَهُمْ كَـرِهُونَ ﴿ (And nothing prevents their contributions from being accepted from them except that they disbelieved in Allah and in His Messenger, and that they came not to the Salah (the prayer) except in a lazy state, and that they offer not contributions but unwillingly.) The Truthful, to whom the Truth was revealed, Muhammad, peace be upon him, said that Allah does not stop giving rewards until you (believers) stop performing good deeds, and that Allah is Tayyib Good and Pure and only accepts what is Tayyib. This is why Allah does not accept charity or good deeds from the people described in these Ayat, because He only accepts it from those who have Taqwa.  "
