  45,5,"<h2>Which was revealed in Makkah</h2>﴾بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ ﴿ In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. <h2>A Directive to contemplate over Allah's Ayat</h2> Allah directs His servants to contemplate His favors and gifts, as well as His great power that is demonstrated by His creating the heavens and the earth and the various types and categories of creatures in them. There are the angels, Jinns, humans, animals, birds, beasts, carnivores, insects and various kinds of sea creatures. The night and day alternate, each follows the other in succession, never ceasing to come, as decreed. One brings darkness and one brings light. Allah the Exalted also sends down the rain from the clouds when it is most needed. He is calling the rain, `provision', because it is the resource that produces various provisions, ﴾فَأَحْيَا بِهِ الاٌّرْضَ بَعْدَ مَوْتِهَا﴿ (and revives therewith the earth after its death,) after it was dry and had no vegetation or life of any kind. Allah said next, ﴾وَتَصْرِيفِ الرِّيَـحِ﴿ (and in the turning about of the winds,) sometimes towards the south and sometimes towards the north. Some are easterly winds and some are westerly winds, some bringing sea breezes and some blow from the land, some coming at night and some by day. Some winds bring rain, some cause pollination and some winds just revive the soul, while some others bear no benefit. Allah said first. ﴾لاّيَـتٍ لِّلْمُؤْمِنِينَ﴿ (are signs for the believers), then ﴾يُوقِنُونَ﴿ (who have faith with certainty), then ﴾يَعْقِلُونَ﴿ (who understand), thus ascending from one honorable stage to what is more honorable and higher in grade. These Ayat are similar to an Ayah in Surat Al-Baqarah ﴾إِنَّ فِي خَلْقِ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ وَاخْتِلَـفِ اللَّيْلِ وَالنَّهَارِ وَالْفُلْكِ الَّتِى تَجْرِى فِى الْبَحْرِ بِمَا يَنفَعُ النَّاسَ وَمَآ أَنزَلَ اللَّهُ مِنَ السَّمَآءِ مِن مَّآءٍ فَأَحْيَا بِهِ الاٌّرْضَ بَعْدَ مَوْتِهَا وَبَثَّ فِيهَا مِن كُلِّ دَآبَّةٍ وَتَصْرِيفِ الرِّيَـحِ وَالسَّحَابِ الْمُسَخَّرِ بَيْنَ السَّمَآءِ وَالأَرْضِ لآيَـتٍ لِّقَوْمٍ يَعْقِلُونَ ﴿ (Verily, in the creation of the heavens and the earth, and in the alternation of night and day, and the ships which sail through the sea with that which is of use to mankind, and the water which Allah sends down from the sky and makes the earth alive therewith after its death, and the moving creatures of all kinds that He has spread therein, and in the veering of winds and clouds which are held between the sky and the earth, are indeed signs for people of understanding.) (2:164) "

  45,11,"<h2>The Description of the Sinful Liar and His Requital</h2> Allah the Exalted says,  تِلْكَ آيَـتُ اللَّهِ  (These are the Ayat of Allah) -- in reference to the Qur'an with the proofs and evidences that it contains,  نَتْلُوهَا عَلَيْكَ بِالْحَقِّ  (which We recite to you with truth.) for they contain the truth from the Truth (i.e., Allah). Therefore, if they do not believe in Allah's Ayat nor abide by them, what speech after Allah and His Ayat will they then believe in Allah said next,  وَيْلٌ لِّكُلِّ أَفَّاكٍ أَثِيمٍ  (Woe to every sinful liar.) who lies in his speech, often swears, who is worthless, commits and utters sinful acts and statements, and disbelieves in Allah's Ayat,  يَسْمَعُ ءَايَـتِ اللَّهِ تُتْلَى عَلَيْهِ  (Who hears the Ayat of Allah Tutla (recited) to him,) meaning, being recited to him,  ثُمَّ يُصِرُّ  (yet persists) in his disbelief, denial, pride and rebellion,  كَأَن لَّمْ يَسْمَعْهَا  (as if he heard them not. ) as if he did not hear them being recited to him,  فَبَشِّرْهُ بِعَذَابٍ أَلِيمٍ  (So announce to him a painful torment!) convey the news to him that on the Day of Resurrection, he will have a painful, severe torment from Allah. Allah said,  وَإِذَا عَلِمَ مِنْ ءَايَـتِنَا شَيْئاً اتَّخَذَهَا هُزُواً  (And when he learns something of Our Ayat, he makes them a jest.) if he learns anything from the Qur'an, he disbelieves in it and takes it as the subject of jest and ridicule,  أُوْلَـئِكَ لَهُمْ عَذَابٌ مُّهِينٌ  (For such there will be a humiliating torment.) as recompense for ridiculing the Qur'an and jesting about it. In the Sahih, Muslim recorded from `Abdullah bin `Umar that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ  prohibited traveling with the Qur'an to enemy lands for fear that the Qur'an might be desecrated by the enemy. Allah explained the type of torment that these people earn on the Day of Return;  مِّن وَرَآئِهِمْ جَهَنَّمُ  (In front of them there is Hell.) meaning, all those who have these evil characteristics will end up in Hellfire on the Day of Resurrection,  وَلاَ يُغْنِى عَنْهُم مَّا كَسَبُواْ شَيْئاً  (And that which they have earned will be of no profit to them, ) their wealth and children will not avail them,  وَلاَ مَا اتَّخَذُواْ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ أَوْلِيَآءَ  (nor those whom they have taken as protecting friends besides Allah.) nor will the false gods that they worshipped besides Allah benefit them in the least,  وَلَهُمْ عَذَابٌ عظِيمٌ  (And theirs will be a great torment.) Allah the Exalted said,  هَـذَا هُدًى  (This is Huda (guidance).) in reference to the Qur'an,  وَالَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ بِـَايَـتِ رَبِّهِمْ لَهُمْ عَذَابٌ مِّن رِّجْزٍ أَلِيمٌ  (And those who disbelieve in the Ayat of their Lord, for them there is a painful torment of Rijz.) that is agonizing and severe. Allah knows best. "
