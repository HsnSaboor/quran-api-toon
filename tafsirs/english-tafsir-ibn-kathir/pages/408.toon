  30,37,"<h2>How man sways between Tawhid and Shirk, and between Joy and Despair, according to His Circumstances</h2> Allah tells us that when man is in dire straits, he calls upon Allah alone with no partner or associate, then when times of ease come and they have the choice, some people associate others with Allah and worship others alongside Him. ﴾لِيَكْفُرُواْ بِمَآ ءاتَيْنَـهُمْ﴿ (So as to be ungrateful for the graces which We have bestowed on them.) Then Allah warns them by saying: ﴾فَسَوْفَ تَعْلَمُونَ﴿ (but you will come to know.) One of them said: By Allah, if a law enforcment officer were to say this to me, I would be afraid, so how about when the One Who is issuing the warning is the One Who merely says to a thing \"Be!\" and it is Then Allah denounces the idolators for fabricating lies and worshipping others instead of Him with no evidence or proof: ﴾أَمْ أَنزَلْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ سُلْطَـناً﴿ (Or have We revealed to them an authority,) means, proof. ﴾فَهُوَ يَتَكَلَّمُ﴿ (which speaks) means, tells ﴾بِمَا كَانُواْ بِهِ يُشْرِكُونَ﴿ (of that which they have been associating with Him) This is a rhetorical question intended to denounce them, for they have no such thing. ﴾وَإِذَآ أَذَقْنَا النَّاسَ رَحْمَةً فَرِحُواْ بِهَا وَإِن تُصِبْهُمْ سَيِّئَةٌ بِمَا قَدَّمَتْ أَيْدِيهِمْ إِذَا هُمْ يَقْنَطُونَ ﴿ (And when We cause mankind to taste of mercy, they rejoice therein; but when some evil afflicts them because of what their hands have sent forth, behold, they are in despair!) This is a denunciation of man for the way he is, except for those whom Allah protects and helps, for when man is given blessings, he is proud, and says: ﴾ذَهَبَ السَّيِّئَاتُ عَنِّي إِنَّهُ لَفَرِحٌ فَخُورٌ﴿ (\"Ills have departed from me.\" Surely, he is exultant, and boastful.) (11:10) He rejoices over himself and boasts to others, but when difficulties befall him, He despairs of ever having anything good again. Allah says: ﴾إِلاَّ الَّذِينَ صَبَرُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّـلِحَاتِ﴿ (Except those who show patience and do righteous good deeds). They are patient during times of difficulty and do good deeds at times of ease. It was reported in the Sahih: ﴾«عَجَبًا لِلْمُؤْمِنِ لَا يَقْضِي اللهُ لَهُ قَضَاءً إِلَّا كَانَ خَيْرًا لَهُ، إِنْ أَصَابَتْهُ سَرَّاءُ شَكَرَ فَكَانَ خَيْرًا لَهُ، وَإِنْ أَصَابَتْهُ ضَرَّاءُ صَبَرَ فَكَانَ خَيْرًا لَه»﴿ (How wonderful is the affair of the believer. Allah does not decree anything for him but it is good for him. If good things happen to him, he gives thanks, and that is good for him; and if bad things happen to him, he bears that with patience, and that is good for him.) ﴾أَوَلَمْ يَرَوْاْ أَنَّ اللَّهَ يَبْسُطُ الرِّزْقَ لِمَن يَشَآءُ وَيَقْدِرُ﴿ (Do they not see that Allah expands the provision for whom He wills and straitens (it for whom He wills).) He is the One Who is controlling and doing that, by His wisdom and justice, so He expands the provision for some people and restricts it for some. ﴾إِنَّ فِى ذلِكَ لآيَـتٍ لِّقَوْمٍ يُؤْمِنُونَ﴿ (Verily, in that are indeed signs for a people who believe.)

  30,40,"<h2>The Command to uphold the Ties of Kinship and the Prohibition of Riba Allah commands giving:</h2>﴾ذَا الْقُرْبَى حَقَّهُ﴿ (to the kindred his due) his due of respect and upholding the ties of kinship. ﴾وَالْمَسَـكِينُ﴿ (and to Al-Miskin) the one who has nothing to spend on his needs, or he has something but it is not enough. ﴾وَابْنِ السَّبِيلِ﴿ (and to the wayfarer.) the traveler who is in need of money and other things during his journey. ﴾ذَلِكَ خَيْرٌ لِّلَّذِينَ يُرِيدُونَ وَجْهَ اللَّهِ﴿ (That is best for those who seek Allah's Face;) meaning; to look upon Him on the Day of Resurrection, which is the ultimate aim. ﴾وَأُوْلَـئِكَ هُمُ الْمُفْلِحُونَ﴿ (and it is they who will be successful.) means, in this world and the Hereafter. Then Allah says: ﴾وَمَآ ءَاتَيْتُمْ مِّن رِّباً لِّيَرْبُوَاْ فِى أَمْوَالِ النَّاسِ فَلاَ يَرْبُواْ عِندَ اللَّهِ﴿ (And that which you give in Riba, in order that it may increase from other people's property, has no increase with Allah;) This means, that which is given as a gift to others in the hope that they will give back more than they were given. There is no reward for this with Allah. This is how this Ayah was interpreted by Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Ad-Dahhak, Qatadah, `Ikrimah, Muhammad bin Ka`b and Ash-Sha`bi. Allah says: ﴾وَمَآ ءاتَيْتُمْ مِّن زَكَوةٍ تُرِيدُونَ وَجْهَ اللَّهِ فَأُوْلَـئِكَ هُمُ الْمُضْعِفُونَ﴿ (but that which you give in Zakah seeking Allah's Face, then those they shall have manifold increase.) Those are the ones for whom Allah will multiply the reward. It was reported in the Sahih: ﴾«وَمَا تَصَدَّقَ أَحَدٌ بِعَدْلِ تَمْرَةٍ مِنْ كَسْبٍ طَيِّبٍ إِلَّا أَخَذَهَا الرَّحْمَنُ بِيَمِينِهِ فَيُرَبِّيهَا لِصَاحِبِهَا، كَمَا يُرَبِّي أَحَدُكُمْ فَلُوَّهُ أَوْ فَصِيلَهُ حَتَّى تَصِيرَ التَّمْرَةُ أَعْظَمَ مِنْ أُحُد»﴿ (No person gives in charity the equivalent of a date which was earned in a lawful manner, but the Most Merciful takes it in His Right Hand and takes care of it for its owner, just as any one of you takes care of his foal or young camel, until the date becomes the size of Mount Uhud.) <h2>Creation, Provision, Life and Death are all in the Hand of Allah Allah says:</h2>﴾اللَّهُ الَّذِى خَلَقَكُمْ ثُمَّ رَزَقَكُمْ﴿ (Allah is He Who created you, then provided food for you,) means, He is the Creator and Provider. He brings man forth from his mother's womb naked and knowing nothing, not able to see or hear, and having no strength. Then He provides him with all these things, giving him household effects, clothing, wealth, possessions and earnings. ﴾ثُمَّ يُمِيتُكُمْ﴿ (then will cause you to die,) means, after this life. ﴾ثُمَّ يُحْيِيكُمْ﴿ (then (again) He will give you life.) means, on the Day of Resurrection. ﴾هَلْ مِن شُرَكَآئِكُمْ﴿ (Is there any of your partners) means, those whom you worship instead of Allah, ﴾مَّن يَفْعَلُ مِن ذَلِكُمْ مِّن شَىْءٍ﴿ (that do anything of that) meaning, none of them are able to do any of that. But Allah is the One Who is Independent in His powers of creation, provision, and giving life and death. Then He will resurrect His creation on the Day of Resurrection. This is why, after all this He says: ﴾سُبْحَانَهُ وَتَعَالَى عَمَّا يُشْرِكُونَ﴿ (Glory be to Him! And Exalted be He above all that they associate. ) meaning, exalted and sanctified and glorified be He far above having any partner, peer, equal, son or father, for He is the One, the Unique, the Self-Sufficient Master, Who begets not nor was He begotten, and there is none comparable unto Him.
