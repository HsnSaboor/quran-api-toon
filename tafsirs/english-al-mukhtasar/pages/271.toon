tafsir[1]{c,v,t}:
  16,42,"These emigrants in Allah’s way are the ones who were patient against the harm of their people and the separation from their families and homes. They were steadfast in Allah’s obedience. They rely only on their Lord in all their affairs and Allah therefore gave them this great reward."
