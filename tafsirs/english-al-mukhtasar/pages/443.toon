tafsir[4]{c,v,t}:
  36,41,"Another sign for them of Allah’s Oneness and of His favour to His servants is that I carried those who were saved from the flood from the progeny of Adam in the time of Noah in the ship that was filled with Allah’s creations. Allah carried therein a pair of every species."
  36,43,"If I wished to drown them I would have done so. There would be no one to help them if I wished to drown them and there would be no one to rescue them if they drowned by My command and decree."
  36,52,"These disbelievers who deny the resurrection will say in regret: What loss is ours! Who is it that has raised us from our grave? They will be given a response to their question: This is what Allah promised and will definitely occur. The messengers spoke the truth in the message of their Lord that they conveyed in this regard."
  36,53,"The matter of resurrection from the graves will only be an effect of a second blowing of the trumpet and all created things will be presented before us on the Day of Resurrection to give account."
