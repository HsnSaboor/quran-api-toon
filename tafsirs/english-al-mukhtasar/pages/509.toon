tafsir[1]{c,v,t}:
  47,26,"Such deviation occurred to them because they secretly said to the idolaters who hate the revelation that He had sent down to His messenger: We will follow you in some matters such as impeding the fighting. Allah knows what they keep hidden and what they make public. Nothing is hidden from Him and He will make apparent whatever He wishes to His messenger."
