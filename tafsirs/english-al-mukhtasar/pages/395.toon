tafsir[1]{c,v,t}:
  28,80,"Those given knowledge said when they saw Qarun in his adornment and when they heard what his companions wished for: “Woe unto you! The reward of Allah in the afterlife and the pleasure He has prepared for those who bring faith and do good deeds is better than the worldly splendour given to Qarun”. And none are granted the ability to say this statement and act accordingly except the patient who persevere in preferring the reward with Allah over the temporary enjoyment of this world."
