tafsir[2]{c,v,t}:
  64,13,"Allah is the Being deserving of worship. There is no other being deserving of worship besides Him. Let the believers place their reliance in Allah alone in all their affairs."
  64,15,"Your wealth and your children are a trial and test for you. They may entice you to earn the unlawful and leave out following Allah. Allah has with Him great reward for those who give preference to following Him over following their children and becoming occupied with wealth. This great recompense is Paradise."
