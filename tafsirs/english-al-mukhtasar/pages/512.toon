tafsir[2]{c,v,t}:
  48,13,"The person who does not have faith in Allah and His Messenger is a disbeliever. I have prepared on the Day of Resurrection for those who deny Allah a blazing fire by which they will be punished."
  48,14,"To Allah alone belongs the control of the heavens and the control of the earth. He forgives the sins of those of His servants whom He wills and enters them into Paradise through His grace. He punishes those of His servants whom He wills out of His justice. Allah forgives the sins of those of His servants who repent to Him and He is merciful towards them."
