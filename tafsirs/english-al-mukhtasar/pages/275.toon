tafsir[1]{c,v,t}:
  16,74,"So - O People - do not make similarities for Allah from these idols that do not benefit nor harm. Allah has no likeness that you can associate with Him in worship. Allah knows the attributes of majesty and perfection that are His and you do not know that and as a result you ascribe partners to Him and claim that your idols are similar to Him."
