tafsir[1]{c,v,t}:
  45,19,"Those who do not know the truth will not be able to hold back Allah’s punishment from you if you follow their desires. And the oppressors from all sects and creeds help and support one another against the believers. And Allah is the helper of those mindful of Him by carrying out His commands and refraining from His prohibitions."
