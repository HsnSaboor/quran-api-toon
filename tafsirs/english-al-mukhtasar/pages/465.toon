tafsir[1]{c,v,t}:
  39,63,"To Him alone belong the keys of the treasures of goodness in the heavens and the earth. He grants it to whoever He wills and withholds it from whoever He wills. Those who reject Allah’s signs they are the losers; as they are deprived of faith in the worldly life and they will enter the fire to live there forever in the Hereafter."
