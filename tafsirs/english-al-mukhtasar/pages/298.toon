tafsir[1]{c,v,t}:
  18,45,"Strike - O Messenger - an example for those who are deceived by the world. In its temporality and fleeting existence it is similar to rain water that I sent down from the sky. On account of this water the vegetation of the earth grew and ripened. Then this vegetation is broken down into pieces and the wind carries it away to far-lying places and the earth once again becomes as it was previously. Allah has full power over all of that. Nothing is outside His ability. He gives life to whatever He wishes and causes whatever He wishes to perish."
