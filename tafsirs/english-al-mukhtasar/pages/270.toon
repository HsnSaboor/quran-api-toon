tafsir[4]{c,v,t}:
  16,27,"Then on the Day of Judgment Allah will humiliate and disgrace them with His punishment and He will say to them: Where are my partners whom you used to associate with me in worship and because of which you used to oppose the prophets and the believers? Those who were righteous scholars will then say:: Indeed! Humilation and torment on this Day will necessarily cover the disbelievers."
  16,29,"It will be said to them: Enter in accordance with your deeds through the doors of Hell to live therein forever. What an evil place of residence for those who were too arrogant to have faith in Allah and worship Him alone."
  16,30,"Yet those who were mindful of their Lord by fulfilling His instructions and avoiding His prohibitions were asked: What did your Lord send down to your Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him)? They replied: Allah has sent down on him great good. For those who worshipped Allah well and treated His creation well in this worldly life there is an excellent reward including victory and abundance of sustenance. And the reward that Allah has prepared for them in the Hearafter will be better then what He has already given them in the world. What an excellent home is the home of the afterlife for those who are mindful of their Lord by fulfilling His instructions and avoiding His prohibitions!"
  16,34,"So the retribution of the actions they used to do came down on them and they were surrounded by the punishment they used to mock at whenever they were reminded of it."
