  72,3,"We have believed that He - exalted be the grandeur and majesty of our Lord - has not taken any wife nor child as the idolaters say."
  72,11,"And that we - the group of jinn-: some of us are Allah-conscious and righteous whilst some of us are disbelievers and sinners. We are of different types and of diverse persuasions."
  72,13,"And that when we heard the Qur’ān that guides to what is most upright we had faith in it. Whoever has faith in his Lord will not fear any loss of his good deeds and nor any sin that will be added to his prior sins."
