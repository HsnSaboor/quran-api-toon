tafsir[1]{c,v,t}:
  46,32,"Those who do not respond to the truth that Muhammad (peace be upon him) calls them towards will not be able to render Allah helpless and escape from Him by fleeing on earth and they will not have besides Allah any protectors to rescue them from the punishment. Such people have clearly deviated from the truth."
