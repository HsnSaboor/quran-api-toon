  25,34,"Those who will be driven on the Day of Judgment being dragged on their faces to Hell. Such people are in the worst place because their place will be Hell and they are on the worst path because their path is the path of disbelief and deviation."

Were they blind to this town and did they not see it? No! Instead they do not expect to be raised from the dead and taken to account thereafter."
