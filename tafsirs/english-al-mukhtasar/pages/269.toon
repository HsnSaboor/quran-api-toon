tafsir[6]{c,v,t}:
  16,15,"He spread out mountains on earth to keep it firm so that it does not shake and cause you to become unsettled. He caused rivers to flow so that you can drink from them and give water to your livestock and crops. He split in it pathways for you to tread and reach your destinations without losing your way."
  16,16,"He made for you on earth clear landmarks that you could be guided by when travelling during the day. He also made for you stars in the sky that you could use as a guide at night."
  16,17,"Is the one who creates all these things like the one who does not create anything?! Do you not think about the greatness of Allah who created everything and worship Him alone without ascribing as partners to Him what has not created anything?"
  16,19,"Allah knows the actions that you - O servants - conceal and those that you reveal. None of those actions are hidden from Him and He will recompense you for them."
  16,24,"When these people who deny the oneness of the Creator and who reject the resurrection are asked: What did Allah reveal to Muhammad (peace be upon him)? They say: He did not reveal anything to him. It is only that he himself has brought stories and fables of the earlier ones."
  16,26,"The disbelievers before these people devised plots against their Messengers. Allah then destroyed their buildings from the foundations and as a result their roofs fell on them from above. The punishment came to them from where they did not expect as they had expected their buildings to protect them but they were destroyed by them."
