tafsir[1]{c,v,t}:
  6,36,"Only those who listen to the speech and understand it will respond to what you have brought. The disbelievers are dead and worthless because their hearts have died. Allah will raise the dead on the Day of Rising and then they will be returned to Him for Him to repay their actions."
