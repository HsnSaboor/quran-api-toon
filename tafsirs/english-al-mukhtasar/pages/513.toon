tafsir[2]{c,v,t}:
  48,21,"And Allah promises you with spoils you have not yet been able to attain. Allah alone is capable of letting you acquire them; they are part of the plans and knowledge of Allah. Allah is capable of everything; nothing is outside His ability."
  48,23,"The believers being victorious and consequent defeat of the disbelievers is established in every place and era; it is a divine custom of Allah prevalent in the nations that have passed before these rejectors. O Messenger! You will not find any change in the divine custom of Allah."
