tafsir[1]{c,v,t}:
  9,110,"The mosque that they built in order to cause harm will continue to be a source of doubt and hypocrisy in their hearts until their hearts are cut into pieces by their death or by their being killed by the sword. Allah knows the actions of His servants and He is Wise in the decision He passes with respect to repaying them for their good or evil."
