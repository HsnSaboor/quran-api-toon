tafsir[1]{c,v,t}:
  23,62,"I do not burden any soul except with whatever actions are within its capability. I have a book in which I have recorded all the deeds of every doer; it shows the undisputable truth. The people will not be wronged by having their good deeds decreased or evil deeds increased."
