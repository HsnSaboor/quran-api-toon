tafsir[2]{c,v,t}:
  52,38,"Or do they have a ladder with which to climb to the sky in which they listen to Allah’s revelation which He sends to tell them they are on the truth? So let the one who listens amongst them to that revelation bring a clear proof to affirm you in your claim that you are on truth."
  52,43,"Or do they have a true god besides Allah? Pure and exalted is Allah from the partner they attribute to him. None of what was mentioned has happened or is even thinkable."
