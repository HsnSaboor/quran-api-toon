tafsir[1]{c,v,t}:
  12,20,"The water-drawer and his companions sold him in Egypt for a petty amount of a few silver coins that could be easily counted due to their small number. They sold him cheaply because they wanted to get rid of him quickly. They had realised from his condition that he was not a slave and they were afraid of his family. Allah was Merciful to him by not keeping him with them for very long."
