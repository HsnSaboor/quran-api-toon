tafsir[1]{c,v,t}:
  5,71,"They thought that no harm would come to them for their breaking promises and covenants and for disbelieving and killing their prophets. But the result of their actions was that they became blind and deaf to the truth and misled from guidance. Then Allah turned towards them out of His grace. They again then became blind and deaf to the truth. This happened to many of them. Allah sees what they do. Nothing is hidden from Him and He will repay them for their actions."
