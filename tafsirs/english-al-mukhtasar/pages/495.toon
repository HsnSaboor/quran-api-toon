tafsir[2]{c,v,t}:
  43,75,"The punishment will not be lessened for them. They will lose all hope in the mercy of Allah in it."
  43,85,"Allah’s goodness and blessings continue to increase - (may He be glorified). To Him alone belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and whatever lies between them. And with Him alone is the knowledge of the Hour in which the Day of Judgement will occur; no one else knows it. And to Him alone will you all return in the afterlife for accountability and requital."
