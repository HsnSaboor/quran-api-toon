tafsir[2]{c,v,t}:
  50,19,"And the intoxication of death will bring the truth; that is what you were trying to avoid. The pangs of death are a reality and will come; there is no escaping from them. O negligent human! That is what you used to turn away from and delay."
  50,26,"Who made [as equal] with Allah another deity; then throw him into the severe punishment. “The one who attributes another deity with Allah and makes him a partner in worship. So throw him into the severe punishment.”"
