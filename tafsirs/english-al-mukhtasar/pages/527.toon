tafsir[10]{c,v,t}:
  53,27,"Those who do not believe in the resurrection in the afterlife give the angels female names in their belief that they are the daughters of Allah. Allah is far above what they say."
  53,30,"That which the idolaters say - about giving the angels female names - is the limit of their knowledge because they are ignorant. They have not reached certainty.
