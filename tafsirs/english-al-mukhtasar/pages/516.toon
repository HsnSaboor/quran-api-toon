tafsir[1]{c,v,t}:
  49,8,"The beautification of goodness and hating of evil that you have achieved is only through the grace of Allah which He bestowed upon you and favoured you with. And Allah is aware of those of His servants who are grateful to Him and so He gives them the ability; He is Wise in that He places each thing in its appropriate place."
