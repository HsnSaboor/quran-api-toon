tafsir[2]{c,v,t}:
  28,88,"And do not worship alongside Allah any god besides Him. There is no true god besides Him. Everything will perish besides His Face. For Him alone is the judgment; He judges as He wishes. And to Him alone you will be returned on the day of judgment to be reckoned and rewarded."
  29,1,"Alif Lam Meem. The discussion on similar letters has already passed at the beginning of Sūrah Al-Baqarah."
