tafsir[1]{c,v,t}:
  10,60,"What do those who invent lies about Allah think will happen to them on the Day of Judgement? Do they think they will be forgiven? Never! Allah is Bountiful to people by giving them respite and not punishing them immediately; but most people deny Allah’s favours to them and are not grateful for them."
