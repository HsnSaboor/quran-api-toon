tafsir[2]{c,v,t}:
  64,1,"All created things in the heavens and all created things on earth declare Allah’s transcendence and purity from every attribute of deficiency that is not appropriate for Him. Sovereignty belongs to Him alone and there is no sovereign besides Him. Good praise is due to Him alone. He has power over all things. Nothing is outside His ability."
  64,4,"He knows whatever is in the heavens and He knows whatever is on earth. He knows the actions that you conceal and those that you reveal. Allah is the Knower of the good or bad that the hearts contain. Nothing of that is hidden from Him."
