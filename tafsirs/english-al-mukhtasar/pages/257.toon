tafsir[1]{c,v,t}:
  14,12,"What sort of objection or excuse would cause us to cease having trust in Him? He has guided us to the clearest and most upright path. We will be patient against the harm you caused to us by belying and mocking us. Those who put their trust in Allah will entrust all of their affairs to Him alone."
