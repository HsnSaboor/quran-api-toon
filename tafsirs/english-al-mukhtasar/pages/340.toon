tafsir[1]{c,v,t}:
  22,71,"The idolaters worship idols instead of Allah; idols which Allah did not reveal any proof of their worship being acceptable in His books. Neither do they have any proof of their own knowledge; their only object of reliance for that is blind following of their forefathers. The wrongdoers will have no helper that will protect them from the punishment of Allah that will fall upon them."
