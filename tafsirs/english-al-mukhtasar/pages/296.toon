tafsir[2]{c,v,t}:
  18,24,"Unless you suspend doing so on Allah’s will by saying: I will do it - if Allah wills - tomorrow. Remember your Lord by saying: “If Allah wills” - if you forget to say it - and say: I have hope that my Lord will guide me to something closer than this in guidance and success."
  18,25,"The people of the cave remained in their cave for three hundred and nine years."
