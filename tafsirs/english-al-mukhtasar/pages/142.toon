tafsir[1]{c,v,t}:
  6,115,"The word of your Lord – namely the Qur’ān – is complete in the truthfulness of its statements and the justice of its instructions and prohibitions. There is no one who can alter His words. He is the One Who hears and knows the statements of His servants. Nothing is hidden from him and He will repay their actions."
