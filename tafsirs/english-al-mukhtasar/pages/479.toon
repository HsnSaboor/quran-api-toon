tafsir[1]{c,v,t}:
  41,28,"That aforementioned requital is the requital of those who disbelieved in Him and rejected His messengers; it is the hellfire which they will live forever never to come out of it. It is a requital for their rejection of the verses of Allah and not believing in them despite their clarity and strength in proof."
