tafsir[6]{c,v,t}:
  36,15,"The people of the town said to those who were sent: You are only men like us. You do not have any special status over us. The Merciful has not sent down any revelation to you. You are only lying about Allah in this claim of yours."
  36,17,"Our duty is only to clearly convey what we have been instructed to convey to you. We have no control over your guidance."
  36,20,"From a far part of the town a man came running fearing his people’s denial of the messengers and their threatening to kill or harm them. He said: O my people! Follow what these messengers have brought."
  36,21,"O people! Follow those who do not ask you for any reward for conveying what they brought and they are rightly guided in the revelation of Allah that they convey to you. A person like this deserves to be followed."
  36,24,"If I have to take them as deities besides Allah I would be in clear error as I would have worshipped a being that is not deserving of worship and I would have omitted worshipping the Being Who is deserving thereof."
