tafsir[2]{c,v,t}:
  41,48,"The idols that they used to call on will disappear from them and they will be certain that they will have no escape from Allah’s punishment."
  41,53,"I will show them My signs in the heavens and on earth. I will show them My signs within souls so that it will become clear to them without any doubt that this Qur’ān is the truth without any doubt. Is it not enough for these idolaters that the Qur’ān is true by Allah’s testimony that it is from Him? Who can be a greater witness than Allah? If they were seeking the truth they would have sufficed with the testimony of their Lord."
