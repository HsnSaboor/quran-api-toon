tafsir[5]{c,v,t}:
  2,113,"The Jews say �The Christians stand on nothing�; and the Christians say �The Jews stand on nothing�; yet they recite the scripture. Thus the ignorant say the like of what these say; God shall decide between them on the Day of Resurrection regarding their differences. The allusion in this verse is an inversion of its apparent sense. Today the enemies [of God] disclaim one another [as they have done in the past] but the friends [of God] also do something like that. Nonetheless it is said that the Sufis will remain in a good state as long as they quarrel and do not accept one other because if they were to accept one another they would stay with each other [rather than turning to God]."
  2,115,"To God belong the East and the West; whithersoever you turn there is the face of God. Lo! God is Embracing Knowing. Here the allusion is to the eastern and western places of hearts [of the believers]. Hearts have rising lights shawāriq and night visitors Ṭawāriq. The night visitors are the murmurings hawājis of the lower selves that arrive in the darknesses of desire and carnal passions. The rising lights are the stars of different types of knowledge the moons of presence and the suns of gnosis. As long as the lights are rising the qibla of the hearts is clear and visible. Then when the realities take over the authority of the lights becomes hid- den like stars at the rising of the sun. Similarly at the appearance of the Real there is destruction and subjugation so there is no witnessing of any trace no remaining sensation or comprehension no power of intellect or knowledge no illumination of deeper knowledge. For the experiencing of all these qualities lasts only as long as human nature lasts. When those who have attributes become effaced how can any attribute of theirs remainḍ He said �whithersoever you turn there is the face of God.� As long as there is a remnant or even a sliver of sensory perception and the ability to differentiate then the qibla should be aimed for and if it is not known it should be sought. According to scholars when the guideposts in every direction are obscure and there is no knowledge of the qibla all directions are equally permissible for prayer since none of them can be preferred for the intention niyya."
  2,117,"Originator of the heavens and the earth; and when He decrees a thing He but says to it �Be� and it is. The Originator al-badīʿ according to the scholars is the One who brings the entity ʿayn into existence without any model lā ʿalā mithāl. According to the people of allusion He is the One and there is nothing like Him laysa lahu shayun mithlihi since this term alludes to both the negation of any likeness mithl to His essence and the negation of any model mithāl for His acts. He is the One al-aḥad without any quantity comprising Him; the Eternal al-ṣamad whom no final point in time cuts off; the Real al-ḥaqq whom no imagination can picture; and the Existent al-mawjūd of whom no understanding is capable. When He decides on an affair nothing preordained maqdūr can oppose it and nothing created mafṬūr can separate itself from His decree."
  2,118,"And they who do not know say �Why does God not speak to usḍ; Why does a sign not come to usḍ� So spoke those before them the like of what they say; their hearts are much alike. Yet We have made clear the signs to a people who are certain. The speech kalām of God ������ is connected to all created things in their entities aʿyān and their traces āthār by the command to �Be!� amr al-takwīn [and it is also connected to] those who have been charged [with the law] by the prescriptive command amr al-taklīf. But whoever lacks the ear of comprehension is deaf to hearing the Real. He ������ addressed some among the people of the Book and they heard His address but they were not able to bear it and after they recognized the enormity of the signs they engaged in distortion and alteration. Included in the signs which He made manifest were that which removes the defect of anything other [than Him] al-ʿilla min al-aghyār and quenches the thirst from things that are better al-ghulla min al-akhyār. But what proofs even if they were plain and clear would suffice those whose due is wretchedness whose [wretch- edness] has already comeḍ"
  2,119,"We have sent you with the truth a bearer of good tidings and warner. You shall not be asked about the inhabitants of hellfire. �We have singled you out [O Muḥammad] with qualities which We did not make appear in anyone else so all people are under your banner. Those who are accepted are in conformity with you while those who are rejected oppose you al-maqbūl man wāfaqaka wa-l-mardūd man khālafaka. You will not be questioned about the states of others and you will not be turned away because of anyone.�"
