tafsir[6]{c,v,t}:
  2,146,"Those to whom We have given the Scripture they recognize him as they recognize their sons; even though there is a party of them that conceal the truth while they know. Their hidden envy causes haughtiness in them concerning what they necessarily know. Similarly whoever has been defeated in the darknesses of his lower self throws off the cloak of bashfulness. There is no use censuring him; words will not rein in his abandon."
  2,147,"The truth comes from your Lord; then be not among the doubters. i.e. 'after the suns of certainty have appeared to you do not yield to the results of mere guessing'. The address is to [the Prophet] but what is intended by it is the community."
  2,149,"From whatever place you issue turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque; it is the truth from your Lord. God is not heedless of what you do. 'Just as you face the qibla from wherever you are whether you are near or far from it likewise draw near to Us in your heart whatever your state whether you are in good fortune from Us or afflicted'."
  2,150,"From whatever place you issue turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque; and wherever you may be turn your faces towards it so that there be not any argument from the people against you; excepting the evildoers among them; 'If you want there to be no pathway for anyone against you no shadow to fall upon you from any created thing and no hand to reach you with evil then from whatever place you issue ḥaythumā kunta whithersoever you are aynamā kunta and whatever state you are in kayfamā kunta be for Us kun lanā and be from Us wa kun minnā for truly whoever occupies themselves exclusively with Us - nothing can get to them'. [2:150 cont'd] and do not fear them but fear Me; 'When they are effaced from their engendered existence kawn as mortal remains rusūm Our decrees aḥkām flow over them so why should there be fear of themḍ' [2:150 cont'd] and that I may perfect My grace upon you and that you may be guided.  The perfection of grace is to add unveiling kashf to kindness luṭf. The one whom He suffices through the exigency of His generosity jūd is below the one whom He enriches by the rightful due ḥaqq of His existence wujūd. Concerning the meaning of this they have recited: \tWe are in the most perfect  happiness but \tonly through you  is the happiness made complete. \tThe [only] imperfection of what we are in  O people of my love \tis that you are absent  while we are present."
  2,151,"As also We have sent among you of yourselves a messenger to recite Our verses to you and to purify you and to teach you the Book and wisdom and to teach you what you knew not. The sending of the Messenger was to open the gates of attainment for it was in His ������ prior knowledge that the hearts of His friends would be thirsty to meet Him. There is no way for anyone to [reach God] except through the intermediary of the messengers. By sending messengers He charged some people with the burdens [of prescriptive law] kulaf and by sending messengers to others He honored them with the arts of drawing near and approaching zulaf. What a difference between one people and another!"
  2,153,"O you who believe seek help through patience and prayer; surely God is with the patient. �Seek the help of [God's] blessing ṣalāt through patience.�That is to say �your being worthy of your Lord's blessing ṣalāt [comes] by your patience at the flow of the decrees of the Real over you.� For that reason God most high said yet give good tidings to the patient [2:155] followed by Upon those rest blessings ṣalawāt and mercy from their Lord [2:157]. It is said that the patient are entitled to the ultimate treasures and the highest ranks inasmuch as they have attained the company maʿiyya of God most high who said �Surely God is with maʿa the patient.�"
