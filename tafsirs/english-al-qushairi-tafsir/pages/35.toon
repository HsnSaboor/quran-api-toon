tafsir[4]{c,v,t}:
  2,220,"They ask you about wine khamr and divinatory arrows. Say: �In both is great sin and profit for men; but the sin in them is greater than the usefulness.� Khamr is whatever intoxicates the mind. Just as khamr is specifically prohib- ited so also drunkenness sukr is prohibited by the words of the Prophet ﷺ �Khamr itself is prohibited and drunkenness from any drink.� From the point of view of the allusions [in the verse] anyone who is drunk from the drink of heedlessness deserves the same as the one who drinks khamr. Just as the one who is drunk is prohibited from praying so the one who is possessed by the drunkenness of heedlessness is veiled from intimate com- munications muwāṣalāt and the clearest testimonial evidence of ecstatic finding wujūd. Anyone who does not think this is true should test it. The notion of gambling can be found in most of the transactions of the people of heedlessness when they follow the way of stratagem and decep- tion and lie in what they say. Wholehearted commitment to truthfulness and equitable dealings is rare and precious. And they will ask you what they should expend. Say: �Comfortably� al-ʿafw. So God makes clear His signs to you that you might reflect on this world and the hereafter. It is said that al-ʿafw is what is in excess of your needs. This is for the elect who take from the surplus of their wealth according to their capacities. As for the elect of the elect their way is �preference� īthār which is to prefer others over themselves even if they are in need of what they give and even though the One they prefer is unseen. They will ask you about orphans. Say: �To set their affairs aright; and if you intermix with them they are your brothers; Setting their state aright in teaching them discipline and manners taÌdīb is more perfect than setting aright their wealth. Patience in bearing with them by giving counsel and abandoning one's weariness in guiding them is better than being permissive to the point that it could be said that one did not uphold one's obligation toward them. God knows well him who works corruption from him who sets aright; and had He willed He would have harassed you. Surely God is Mighty Wise.� He deals with everyone according to the intentions quṣūd that dwell in a person's heart not according to the external things one acquires in vari- ous ways."
  2,221,"Do not marry idolatresses until they believe; a believing slave girl is better than an idolatress though you may admire her. And do not marry idolaters until they believe. A believing slave is better than an idolater though you may admire him. Those call to the fire; and God calls to paradise and pardon by His leave; and He makes clear His signs to the people so that they might remember. It is better to hold to the rope of religion and cling to the protection of Muslims than to be satisfied with someone [outside the faith] on a path that leads to disbelief. A concession in the law exists for this action but the deeper suggestion is to refrain and waive the right to choose it. This concerns the women of the Book with whom it is permissible to have mari- tal relations. As for polytheists it is absolutely prohibited to have marital relations with them. It is obligatory to cut off relations with those in this category-this is an irreversible decree."
  2,222,"They will ask you about the monthly period. Say: �It is an ailment; so part with women in the monthly period and do not approach them until they are pure; when they have cleansed themselves then come to them as God has commanded you.� Not everything which is a cause for embarrassment and aversion is some- thing the servant freely chooses for it might be among the imperfections which are not attributed to the servant but rather stem from a decree of the Real. Among these is what God has ordained for the daughters of Adam in [relation to] this condition. Moreover they were commanded to withdraw from the prayer carpet during the times of this condition since the prayer carpet is a place of intimate conversation with one's Lord. So setting a time in which the place of conversation is to be avoided is a decree from God not [because of any] sin of theirs. In this is an allusion for it is said that even if they cannot pray which [requires] being present through the body they are not prevented from perpetual remembrance dhikr in the heart and tongue. That [dhikr] is an address on the carpet of nearness. The Prophet ﷺ said relating from God most high �I sit among those who remember Me.� Truly God loves those who repent and He loves those who cleanse themselves. It is said that He loves those who repent from sins dhunūb and those who cleanse themselves from defects ʿuyūb. It is said that [it refers to] those who repent from error and those who cleanse themselves from imagining that their salvation is through repentance. It is said that [it refers to] those who repent from doing forbidden things and those who cleanse themselves from familiar things and considerations [of anything but God]. It is said that [it refers to] those who repent by seeking the water of for- giveness and those who cleanse themselves by pouring the water of shame [upon themselves] through the [human] attribute of brokenness. It is said that [it refers to] those who repent from error and those who cleanse themselves from heedlessness. It is said that [it refers to] those who repent from witnessing the repen- tance and those who cleanse themselves from imagining that anything is by error rather than by the decree that originates from God most high."
  2,224,"Do not make God a hindrance in your oaths to be pious and God-fearing; and to put things right between people; surely God is All-Hearing Knower. Keep the mention of your Lord free of the banality of any worldly concerns. It is said �Do not make the mention of God into a net to catch the debris of this world.�"
