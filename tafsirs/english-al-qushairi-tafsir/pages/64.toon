tafsir[7]{c,v,t}:
  3,109,"Those are the verses of God which We recite to you in truth and God desires not any injustice for the worlds. To God belongs all that is in the heavens and in the earth and to Him all matters are returned. We make our address to you continuous in all times in all things small and large a cultivation of the way of love widād. And God desires not any injustice for the worlds: How could it be pos- sible to ascribe injustice to Him in the determining of events taqdīr and existence wujūd when all created beings are His creation and what has been determined for them is His wise determination ḥukmḍ To God belongs all that is in the heavens and in the earth by way of possession milk and to Him all matters are returned by way of determi- nation ḥukm."
  3,110,"You are the best community khayra ummatin brought forth to men enjoining decency and forbidding indecency and believing in God. Because MuṣṬafā ﷺ is the most honored of the prophets his community is the best of communities. Because they are the best of communities they are the most desiring ashwāq of communities. Because they are the most desiring of communities their lives are the shortest of lives. He created them as the last of created beings so that their stay beneath the earth would not be long [before the resurrection]. Their goodness khayriyya has been obtained not by the abundance of their prayers and devotional acts but by the intensity with which He has drawn them near and selected them. Surely the standing of the earlier ones at the door has been long but when the permission comes to enter the later ones will go first. How many reach out to connect to us [yet] their palms receive no share. Enjoining decency and forbidding indecency: Decency is service to the Real and indecency is keeping company with the lower self. Decency is to prefer what is due to the Real ḥaqq al-ḥaqq and inde- cency is to choose the worldly concerns of the lower self ḥaẓẓ al-nafs. Decency is what brings you close to Him and indecency is what veils you from Him. In the command to decency you are bound to be characterized by decency and in forbidding indecency you are required to turn away from it. Had the people of the scripture believed it would have been better for them; some of them are believers; but most of them are wicked. If everyone had been included under Our command they would have attained true glory in this world and the hereafter but they were kept away from acceptance in the choice already made-most of them were branded with associating partners with God shirk."
  3,111,"They will not harm you except a little hurt; and if they fight against you they will turn their backs to you then they will not be helped. The Real ������ ������ does not give His enemies power over His friends except as much as will prove the sincerity of the flight [of the friends] to God for the reality of their flight firār is nobler before Him than their staying firm qarār. If [the enemies] imagine themselves to be superior to the friends in truth they suffer lowliness and degradation."
  3,112,"Abasement shall be cast upon them wherever they are found save a rope of God and a rope of the people; they have incurred anger from God and poverty shall be cast upon them; that because they disbelieved in God's signs and slew the prophets without right; that because they disobeyed and used to transgress. The sign of being exiled cannot be hidden the mark of distance cannot be concealed and the evidence of being cut off cannot be veiled. They are in the lowly state of having been banished and abased by rejection. Those who have eyes ulū l-abṣar learn from them while those among the dis- believers and the profligates al-kuffār al-fujjār who are of their kind are deceived by them."
  3,113,"Yet they are not all alike; some of the people of the scripture are a community upright who recite God's verses in the watches of the night pros- trating themselves. They believe in God and in the Last Day enjoining decency and for- bidding indecency vying with one another in good works; those are of the righteous. Just as the difference between light and darkness is one of contradiction it has likewise been established that the states of the friends and the states of the enemies are mutually exclusive. How can illumination and darkness ẓulma certainty and suspicion tuhma communion and separation furqa distance and intimacy ulfa devotion on the carpet and turning from the door being characterized by friendship walāÌ and departing from fidelity wafāÌ be considered equalḍ How can the two possibly come togetherḍ How can they be compatible or equalḍ"

  3,115,"And whatever good they do they shall not be denied it and God knows the God-fearing. One who is intent shall not be debarred from His door; one who does busi- ness shall not suffer loss on His account; one who desires companionship shall not be lonely with Him; and one who seeks shall not be contemptible before Him."
