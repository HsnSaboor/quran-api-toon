tafsir[6]{c,v,t}:
  3,1,"Alif Lām Mīm His saying �Alif� alludes to His being sufficient for you in all of your states. You are captive to heedlessness and have not found the way to right action and thinking. He is the One who sets in motion what restores you and is solely sufficient for you in what helps you. Without your asking-and even without you knowing your own state-He suffices for you even if you do not perceive it. He gives to you without your seeking. The Lām alludes to His kindness luṬf to you at the most subtle and hidden level so much so that the locus of favor by which He strengthens you is not apparent to you. The Mīm alludes to the harmony muwāfaqa of the stream of the [divine] determination of events taqdīr with the circumstances requested by the friends. Nothing in the world moves no particle appears unless it is an occasion of good pleasure with respect to them. It would not be going too far to say that in His words �Every day He is upon some matter� [55:29] the �matter� is an actualization of what the friends desire. It is said that by listening to these disconnected letters [Alif Lām Mīm] which are contrary to the ordinary customs of human discourse every concept disappears from the hearts whether it be a known written cus- tomary or imagined thing and whether it arises from necessity Ḍarūra sensory perception ḥiss or independent reasoning ijtihād. When the hearts are emptied of imagined and known concepts and the innermost selves are purified of customary and familiar things the name Allāh comes to a heart sanctified from everything other [than Him] and to an innermost self purified of every mode [of inquiry] kayf."
  3,2,"God! There is no god except Him the Living the Eternal. He is the One who is not diverted so as to be too busy for you nor is He inattentive so that you are left without Him. He is the attentive observer raqībover all of the states of your innermost self. If you are alone He is watchful over you. If you are in the midst of human beings He is watch- ful over you. In sum however your states circle around you He is your Beloved ḥabīb."
  3,3,"He has revealed to you the Book by the truth �You did not know O Muḥammad what the Book was nor the story of the lovers. But a matter of pre-eternal choosing came suddenly upon you and cast you into an amazing affair its proof sublime its place of descent and occurrence precious.� confirming what was before it that is verifying His promise to you in the books that came through the prophets [���� ������]. and He revealed the Torah and the Gospel before as guidance to people and He revealed the criterion. That is to say �Even though We revealed Our books to the messengers before you We did not omit the remembrance dhikr of you from any book.� The one who spoke for them said: With me from our absent beloveds are pages. The remembrance of you is their title page. �Just as We have extended the lights of the prophets through you We have adorned all that We have revealed in remembrances with your remembrance.� As for those who disbelieve in God's signs for them awaits a terrible chastisement. [The chastisement] is the ignominy of the veil but they do not perceive [this]. God is Precious ʿazīz to His friends Lord of Retribution to His enemies. Everyone seeks what is precious but most do not find it."
  3,4,"He has revealed to you the Book by the truth �You did not know O Muḥammad what the Book was nor the story of the lovers. But a matter of pre-eternal choosing came suddenly upon you and cast you into an amazing affair its proof sublime its place of descent and occurrence precious.� confirming what was before it that is verifying His promise to you in the books that came through the prophets [���� ������]. and He revealed the Torah and the Gospel before as guidance to people and He revealed the criterion.

The remembrance of you is their title page. �Just as We have extended the lights of the prophets through you We have adorned all that We have revealed in remembrances with your remembrance.� As for those who disbelieve in God's signs for them awaits a terrible chastisement. [The chastisement] is the ignominy of the veil but they do not perceive [this]. God is Precious ʿazīz to His friends Lord of Retribution to His enemies. Everyone seeks what is precious but most do not find it."
  3,5,"Nothing whatever is hidden in heaven and earth from God. A servant does not breathe a single breath without God ������ ������ counting it muḥṣīhi. Not a particle exists in the heaven and earth unless He is its originator and creator mubdiʿ hi. No one has any quality or attribute except He is its governor mutawallīhi. This is the view of ordinary people ʿumūm. As for the elect khuṣūṣ no one presents a need to Him except He satisfies it qāḌīhā and no one has any resource in a calamity except He suffices for it kāfīhā."
  3,9,"Our Lord You shall gather mankind for a day of which there is no doubt; verily God will not fail the tryst. Today is the gathering of the lovers on the carpet of approach iqtirāb and tomorrow will be the gathering of all in the place of reward thawāb and punishment ʿiqāb. Today is the gathering of innermost selves asrār for the unveiling of [divine] Majesty jalāl and Beauty jamāl and tomor- row will be the gathering of human beings abshār to witness the terrors ahwāl and endure what has been told of these states aḥwāl."
