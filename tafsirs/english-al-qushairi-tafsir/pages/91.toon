tafsir[6]{c,v,t}:
  4,80,"Whoever obeys the Messenger verily obeys God; and whoever turns his back We have not sent you as a watcher over them. This verse alludes to the gathering jamʿ of the state of the Messenger ﷺ for He ������ said �Obedience to him is obedience to Us. Whoever draws near to him draws near to Us. Whoever is accepted by him is accepted by Us maqbūluhu maqbūlunā and whoever is rejected by him is rejected by Us wa-mardūduhu mardūdunā.�"
  4,81,"They say obedience; but when they sally forth from you a party of them harbor other than what they say. God writes down what they harbor [in themselves]. So turn away from them rely on God and God suffices as a Guardian. This means that �when they come to you [Muḥammad] they surrender to your witnessing mushāhada but when they leave the light of your approach iqbāl is cut off and they return to darknesses� just as they say: Whenever he repents he returns to his ignorance just as the one who is feeble suffers a relapse."
  4,82,"What do they not ponder yatadabbarūna the QurÌānḍ If it had been from other than God surely they would have found therein much inconsistency. And when there comes to them an issue be it of security or of fear they broadcast it. If they had referred it to the Messenger and to those in authority among them those among them who are able to think it out yastanbiṬūnahu would have known it from them. And but for the bounty of God to you and His mercy you would surely have followed Satan except a few [of you]. �Pondering� tadabbur is an allusion to meanings acquired through immersing [oneself] deeply in contemplation. The mining of the jewels of meanings is through precise �extraction� istinbāṬ. And when there comes to them an issue... Because they are heedless of the Real they have no one to whom they can transmit their secrets so they reveal the secret to each other. As for the believers the Knower of their secrets is their Friend and Protector. They speak with Him about what comes to them and have no need to broadcast the secret to any created being. The Hearer of their whispered confidence is God and the Knower of their hidden affairs is God. If they had referred it to the Messenger and to those in authority among them... that is if they had brought their secrets to those who are respected and those among the people of the story it would have dispelled their doubts and helped them through the light of guidance and spiritual instruction. And but for the bounty of God with His friends they would wander in every wadi of separation of the moment just as those outwardly like them do."

  4,84,"So fight in the way of God; you are charged only with yourself. And urge on the believers; maybe God will restrain the might of the disbelievers; God is mightier and more severe in castigation. �Rise up [Muḥammad] with Us in surrendering everything from you to Our command. Just as there is no one to compare to you in your rank because of your elevated status over all We likewise do not charge anyone but you with the like of what you have been charged and We do not burden anyone but you with what you have been burdened. This is because of your singular worth among those otherwise like you in outward form.�"
  4,85,"Whoever intercedes with a good intercession shall receive a share of it; and whoever intercedes with an evil intercession shall receive the like from it. God conserves all things. �The intercessor liberates the state of the one for whom he intercedes. The intercessor becomes worthy of a weighty rank from God ������ by virtue of his intercession while the one who hastens to do corruption with regard to Our command bears the responsibility and carries the weight of the sin.�"
