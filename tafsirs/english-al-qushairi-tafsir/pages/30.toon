tafsir[4]{c,v,t}:
  2,191,"And slay them wherever you come upon them It means �It is incumbent on you to show enmity toward My enemies just as it is incumbent on you to establish friendship walāya and assistance muwālā with My friends awliyāÌ. So do not spare them even if there are bonds of kinship or close relation between you.� and expel them from where they expelled you; �First expel [your] love and mutual assistance with them from your hearts and then drive them from the regions of Islam so that they will be diminished.� sedition is more grievous than slaying. Here the allusion is to the ordeal that comes to hearts qulūb from the misfortunes of veiling; this is more grievous than that which comes to the bodily selves nufūs from the exertion of the spirit rūḥ because the pass- ing away of the life of the heart is more grievous than the passing away of the life of the bodily self. The bodily selves live through what is fitting and familiar to them but the heart can only live through God. It is said that sedition is more grievous than slaying means that remain- ing apart from God is much worse than letting go of your spirit ruḥ and your life ḥayāt. But fight them not by the sacred mosque until they should fight you there; then if they fight you slay them-such is the requital of disbelievers. The allusion in it: Do not disturb your time waqt with God [do not] let in the attributes that characterize the bodily and lower self even if these involve supererogatory acts of obedience. If a noisy preoccupation distracts you from God remove that matter from yourself by every means possible so that no attachment remains to block you from God."
  2,192,"But if they desist surely God is Forgiving Merciful. The allusion in it: When the clamor of your thoughts and the enemies of your self nafs cut you off and they separate you from [God] and jostle you give up the chatter of the lower self nafs and stop its combative motion for surely those who have been asked to guard the innermost selves asrār should not have any business with the exertions of the lower selves nufūs in their various oppositional ways."
  2,193,"Fight them till there is no sedition and the religion is for God; then if they desist there shall be no enmity save against evildoers. The allusion in the verse is to combat against the lower selves nufūs for your worst enemy is your lower self nafs within you. That is to say �Hold completely to the precepts of spiritual disciplines riyāḌāt until nothing remains of carnal human traces āthār bashariyya. Submit the self nafs and heart qalb to God so there will be no opponent or combatant from within you [fighting] to protect [yourself] taking instruction [from the lower self] managing [your own affairs] or exercising free choice in any state. The vicissitudes [of life] will flow over you as He wills them and you will be effaced from making any choices aside from what comes with the decree.� When the self nafs surrenders there is no enmity except toward the masters of holding back arbāb al-taqṣīr but those who uphold the right of [God's] command are far removed from any obligation to compel [others to do so]."
  2,194,"The sacred month for the sacred month; holy things demand retalia- tion; whoever commits aggression against you then commit aggression against him in the manner that he committed against you; and fear God and know that God is with the God-fearing. [Here] the allusion is to: �When two of the rights of God face off submit the moment waqt to the decree of the moment ḥukm al-waqt and turn with the allusions of the moment ishārāt al-waqt. Beware of preferring one over the other in what you possess in your worldly portion ḥaẓẓ- even a little-for you will be veiled from witnessing the Real ḥaqq and the vision of your heart will be blinded. Everything that is closer to what opposes your whims and further from what attracts and pleases you is in itself more appropriate.� And know that God is with the God-fearing those who fear the prefer- ence of their own whims over that with which He is pleased. When they act for God in what they do rather than for themselves God most high is with them through [His] help: He said �If you help God He will help you� [47:7]."
