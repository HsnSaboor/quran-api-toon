tafsir[2]{c,v,t}:
  4,15,"As for those of your women who commit lewdness call four of you to witness against them; and if they witness then detain them in their houses until death take them or God appoints for them a way. So as to lower the veil of generosity over the sins of servants [God] made allowances through an excessive number of witnesses [required] to estab- lish proof of lewdness which is fornication. To follow the witnessing pro- cedure in the law makes establishing proof of the circumstances nearly impossible. When Māʿiz [ibn Mālik] told [the Prophet] ﷺ �O Messenger of God may the blessings of God be upon you I have committed fornication� he said �Maybe you [only] kissedḍ� On another occasion [the Prophet] said �smell his breath.� In this there is the strongest proof of what I have mentioned of the lowering of the veil over ugly acts."
  4,16,"And when two of you commit it punish them both; but if they repent and make amends then leave them be. God ever turns [relenting] and is Merciful. The command to various modes of punishment for those who do this act is the strongest way to kindly communicate [the advice] to prevent and stay away from it so that the servant might be on his guard and not become deserving of the greater punishment."
