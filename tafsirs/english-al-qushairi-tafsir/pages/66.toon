tafsir[10]{c,v,t}:
  3,122,"parties of you were about to lose heart; and God was their protector and let the believers rely on God. He brings forth everyone in the vest of free choice ikhtiyār as if their negation and affirmation their acts and abstention from acting were at their [own] command. In truth they are only turned about by the agency of His grasp taṣrīf al-qabḌa and the turning of His deliberative power taqlīb al-qudra."
  3,124,"were saying to the believers �Is it not sufficient for you that your Lord should reinforce you with three thousand angels sent downḍ Yea if you are patient and fear and they come against you instantly your Lord will reinforce you with five thousand angels accoutred.� The tranquility sent by the Real ������ to the heart of MuṣṬafā ﷺ was from God ������ without intermediary while the strengthening of the hearts of the believers was through the intermediary of the Messenger ﷺ. If not for [the doubt that] remained in them he would not have replied to them telling [them] of the help [that would] be sent in the angel malak. Why tell of the angel when the affair is entirely in the hand of the King malikḍ"

  3,126,"What God ordained was only as a good tiding to you and that your hearts might be at peace. Victory comes only from God the Mighty the Wise. God ������ follows His practice sunna with His friends is such a way that when their intentions niyyāt become weak their spiritual desire irāda low or their hearts are on the verge of listlessness fatra He shows them kindnesses alṬāf and special gifts karāmāt. By these the ties of their deeper knowledge ʿirfān are strengthened and the realities of their cer- tainty yaqīn are confirmed. He sent down this address according to this practice sunna. Then He severed their hearts and innermost selves from anything other than Him entirely saying Victory comes only from God."
  3,127,"And that He might cut off a party of the disbelievers or suppress them so that they fall back frustrated. God does not let enemies gloat over the misfortunes of His friends. Even if the believer is struck by a catastrophic defeat nakba there is no doubt that God will cause His enemy to suffer trial and punishment."
  3,128,"it is no concern at all of yours whether He relents to them or chastises them; for they are indeed evildoers. To God belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth; He forgives whom He wills and chastises whom He wills. And God is Forgiving Merciful. The deity is the One to whom belongs the command and the prohibition. Because there is no counterpart to Him in divinity [the Prophet] ﷺ has nothing to do with the command and the prohibition. It is said that in what He taught him and told him He divested [the Prophet] of everything else and every share or claim inasmuch as He stated that the command was in no way his. If no part of the command is permit- ted for the leader of the first and the last how can there be any part of the command for the one whose rank is lower in stationḍ It is said that He takes for Himself alone the secret of His servants in His decree ḥukm saying �I am the One who relents to whom I will among My servants and I punish whom I will. What happens in the end is hidden from you O Muḥammad and you are not aware of My secret regarding them.� It is said that He raised [the Prophet] up at one time to a station in which He said �and you threw not when you threw but God threw� [8:17]. [The Prophet] threw a handful of earth and hit all the faces [of the enemy]. But in another time He said to him �No part of the command is yours� [3:128] and then added in explanation �To God belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth� [3:129]. Therefore the right to possess is His right to pos- sess mulk the command is His command amr and the decree is His decree ḥukm. He punishes whom He will fa-man shāÌa ʿadhdhabahu and brings closer [to Him] whom He will wa-man shāÌa qarrabahu. He guides whom He will wa-man shāÌa hadāhu and leads astray whom He will wa-man shāÌa aghwāhu."

  3,130,"O you who believe do not exact usury doubled and redoubled. And fear God so that you may prosper. And fear the fire that has been prepared for the disbelievers. [God] has prohibited usury for His servants; this includes loaning one amount and asking twice as much in return. But He has asked you for a loan which He will repay seven hundredfold even up to an infinite repay- ment.This alludes to the magnanimity karam that is not inherent in humans but rather is an attribute of the Real ������. And fear the fire that has been prepared for the disbelievers: These words indicate that the believer will not be chastised by [the fire]. If he is chastised by it for a time he will not abide in it."

  3,132,"And obey God and the Messenger so that you may find mercy. [God] tied obedience to the Messenger ﷺ to obedience to Himself. This was to elevate [the Prophet's] rank and to make things easier for the com- munity by handing them over to the company of an individual who was one of them. It is more reassuring to be with one's own kind."
