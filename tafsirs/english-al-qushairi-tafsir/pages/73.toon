tafsir[6]{c,v,t}:
  3,174,"So they returned with grace and bounty from God and no evil touched them and they followed the beatitude of God; and God is of bounty abounding.  Such is the way sunna of the Real ������ with those who are sincere in taking refuge with Him in that He prepares a resting place in the shadow of His sufficiency. No affliction touches them no pains distress them and no hardships overcome them."
  3,175,"That is only Satan making fear his friends therefore do not fear them; but fear Me if you are believers. The allusion in [God's] granting power to the calls of Satan in the hearts of [His] friends is [to the test] that confirms their flight to God. This is like a child who has been frightened by one of those things that frighten children and when he is afraid he goes only to his mother. When he comes to her she takes him to herself hugs him and presses her cheek to his. Likewise when the servant is sincere in beseeching God and returns to Him from his oppositional tendencies He takes him under the wing of His closeness and overtakes him with His beautiful kindness."
  3,176,"Let them not grieve you those that vie with one another in unbelief; they will not hurt God at all. God desires not to assign them any portion in the hereafter and theirs is a mighty chastisement. He strengthened [Muḥammad's] heart by renewing the firmness of the pact in that He would not allow any enemy to gloat over his misfortune nor allow any evil from them to reach him."
  3,177,"Those who purchase unbelief at the price of faith they will not hurt God at all and there awaits them a painful chastisement. If they cause harm aḌarrū it is only to themselves. If they persist aṣarrū they persist only to their own loss. We did not suffer from the distance to their abodes nor did longings drive us toward them."
  3,178,"And let not the disbelievers suppose that what We indulge them in is better for their souls. We grant them indulgence only that they may increase in sinfulness and theirs is a humbling chastisement. �Part of the perfection of the ruse against them and the intensification in their punishment is that We are punishing them even as they do not perceive it: We will draw them on by degrees whence they do not know [7:182]. We indulge them and they think that it is an act of favor inʿām; [they do] not consider that it might be an act of revenge intiqām.� When the underlying forces of the divine preordination are made clear to them [in] their hiding places they will know that they have lost khusrān. It is already clear to anyone possessing insight that that which brings about disobedience ʿiṣyān or causes forgetfulness nisyān cannot be counted among the acts of favor inʿām."
  3,179,"It is not God's purpose to leave the believers in the state in which you are till He shall distinguish the evil one from the good. And it is not God's purpose to apprise you of the unseen but God chooses of His messengers whom He will. So believe in God and His messengers; and if you believe and guard [against evil] then yours shall be a great wage. He has gathered [humankind] together in the here and now with respect to bodies and forms mabānī but has separated them in the deeper realities and meanings maʿānī. Some of them are good Ṭayyib in their natural disposition and some are evil khabīth. Even if their constitutions are mixed they are differentiated in the inner sight of the elect. And it is not God's purpose to apprise you of the unseen: Surely the secrets of the unseen do not appear to those who are sullied by the pollu- tions of mortal human nature bashariyya. Only the Real ������ possesses knowledge of that which is great and small and He selects whomever He will among His prophets for knowledge of some of His secrets."
