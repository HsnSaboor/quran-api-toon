tafsir[6]{c,v,t}:
  3,187,"And when God made a covenant with those who had been given the scripture �You shall expound it to people and not conceal it.� But they rejected it behind their backs and bought it with a small price; how evil is what they have bought! [God] said that they had vowed to uphold their agreements but broke the ties of the covenant in turning to disbelief. Then it became clear that what they took as cheap substitutes for leaving religion would have no blessings for them."
  3,188,"Do not reckon that those who rejoice in what they have brought and who love to be praised for what they have not done-do not reckon them secure from the chastisement; there shall be a painful chastisement for them. Surely those whose hearts look only to created beings and whose innermost secrets regard only [created beings]-do not think that their punishment will be delayed to the Day of Resurrection. No they are not secure from the punishment in the here and now. What punishment is more intense than being thrown back to created beings khalq and veiled from the Real ḥaqqḍ"
  3,189,"To God belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and God has power over all things. This verse alludes to [God's] lack of need for anyone in existence. How could He have any need of themḍ But they [on the other hand] will find no one to stand in for Him and no substitute for Him."
  3,190,"Surely in the creation of the heavens and the earth and in the alterna- tion of night and day there are signs for people of pith. Those who remember God standing and sitting and on their sides The signs which the Real ������ presents to ordinary people are from the lessons and the vestiges [of people gone by] in the regions [of the heavens and the earth]. The signs which He presents to the elect are within their souls. [God] ������ said �We shall show them Our signs in the horizons and in their own souls� [41:53]. The outer signs lead to the knowledge of certainty ʿilm al-yaqīn while the inner signs lead to the eye of certainty ʿayn al-yaqīn. The alternation ikhtilāf of night and day alludes to the different responses ikhtilāf to the night among the servants. The nights of the people of communion are short and the nights of the people of separation are long. [Someone] said: Months pass- we have not noticed their midpoints nor their ends. And he said: For you morning is drunkenness and the night a hangover. You slept even as the days of happiness were short. A second [poet] said: After they departed the nights were long in so many ways- [once short] the night of the lovers is [now] long. A third [poet] had nothing to say about the length or brevity of the night for he said because of what had overwhelmed him: How should I know whether the night was long or notḍ How can one who is on fire know thatḍ If I had paid attention to the length of the night I would have been deprived of watching the stars. For people of pith: The people of pith ulū l-albāb are those whose intellects have been kept sound from the drunkenness of forgetfulness and inattention. The sign of one like this is that his gaze will be through the Real. When he gazes from the Real to the Real his gaze is in the right direction. But when he gazes from created beings and things to the Real his thoughts are thrown into upheaval which causes a state of confusion. Those who remember God standing and sitting: Remembrance dhikr permeates their every moment. If they stand it is in remembrance of Him."
  3,192,"Our Lord whomever You admit into the fire You will have abased and the evildoers shall have no helpers. �Whomever You put to the test in the future by burning ḥurqa You will have abased him. And whomever you put to the test by separation furqa in the present you will have made him miserable. Whomever you have entrusted with the good fortune of communion wuṣla You will have sheltered him and brought him close.�"
  3,193,"�Our Lord we have heard a caller calling to belief saying 'Believe in your Lord!' And we believed. So our Lord forgive us our sins and absolve us of our evil deeds and take us [in death] with the pious. It means �We have answered the caller dāʿī but You are the guide hādī so do not leave us to ourselves and do not raise the shadow of your care from us.� Faith īmān is entering into that which brings security amān and one only has faith in the Real from the Real granting him security. The security of the Real for the servant which is His granting him protection brings about the faith of the servant in the Real which is his affirmation taṣdīq of Him and his deep recognition maʿrifa of Him. And take us [in death] with the pious: They are those chosen for the proper ways of declaring oneness ḥaqāÌiq al-tawḥīd those who stand for God [according] to the conditions of utter devotion sharāÌiṬ al-tafrīd and stay with God by the special characteristics of disengaging [from anything other than Him] khaṣāÌiṣ al-tajrīd."
