tafsir[3]{c,v,t}:
  2,234,"And those of you who pass away leaving wives they shall wait by themselves for four months and ten. When they have reached their term then you would not be at fault regarding what they may do with themselves honorably; God is aware of what you do. Because the right of the dead is more important since his separation is not by choice the period [for the widow] to complete used to be longer. In the beginning of Islam the waiting period after death was one year. However it reverted to four months and ten days [the time necessary] to verify that no sperm of the husband is present in the womb. When the waiting period comes to an end [the widow] is permitted to marry another man. No one's fidelity lasts to the end of life as it is said: Just as faces decay in the ground so does the grief of [women]."
  2,235,"You would not be at fault regarding the proposal you present or hide in your hearts to women. God knows that you will be mindful of them; but do not make arrangements with them secretly unless you speak honorable words. This permits seeking affection and laying the foundation for [marital] union. It forbids doing prohibited sinful acts or preparing for such acts. And do not resolve on the knot of marriage until that which is written has reached its term; and know that God knows what is in your souls; so be fearful of Him; and know that God is Forgiving Forbearing. That is the waiting period for the first [marriage] is required to avoid any disrespect for the deceased."
  2,236,"You would not be at fault if you divorce women whom you have not touched nor appointed any obligation for them; yet make provision of com- forts for them honorably the one of ample means according to his means and the needy man according to his means-an obligation on the virtuous. If you have initiated366 the union with your mates but then change your mind [before the consummation] there is no fault on you if you choose separation for there is only One from whom it is not permissible to choose to separate. The companionship of human beings with one another is not obligatory but rather is described at most as permissible. But367 because your name and reputation are now part of theirs half of the determined amount [of the dowry] must belong to them since separation-however it comes about-is difficult. So [God] has established the required compensa- tion for [the woman] who is made to drink from the cup of separation. If there was no determined amount the contract still requires the gift mutaʿ because her being made to drink from the cup of separation without [some compensatory] comfort is a terrible thing for her to suffer."
