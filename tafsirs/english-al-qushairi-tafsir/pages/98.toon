tafsir[4]{c,v,t}:
  4,122,"But those who believe and perform righteous deeds We shall admit them to gardens underneath which rivers flow abiding therein for ever; God's promise in truth; and who is truer in utterance than Godḍ �Those whom We have made fortunate by [Our] decree and speech asʿadnāhum ḥukman wa-qawlan were helped at the time We brought them into existence by [Our] generosity and power awjadnāhum kara- man wa-Ṭawlan. Then surely We brought about what had been promised in reward nuḥaqqiqu la-hum al-mawʿūda min al-thawāb through what We gave them in a place of good return bi-mā nukrimuhum bihi min ḥusni al-maÌāb.�"
  4,123,"It is not your desires nor the desires of the people of the scripture. Whoever does evil shall be requited for it; and he will not find besides God any friend or helper. And whoever does righteous deeds whether male or female and is a believer-such shall be admitted into paradise and not be wronged the dint in a date-stone. Whoever plants colocynth will not harvest roses and jasmine. Whoever drinks deadly poison will not find the taste of honey. Likewise whoever squanders the duty of service will not become firmly established on the carpet of nearness. Whoever is branded with misfortune wa-man wusima bi-l-shiqwati will not be provided with the best of the best lam yurzaq al-ṣafwati. Whomever the divine decree rejects wa-man nafathu al-qaḌiyyati there is no helper for him in creation fa-lā nāṣira lahu min al-bariyyati. And whoever does righteous deeds... �Whoever labors in Our service khidma will not be kept from attaining Our blessing niʿma. Indeed whomever We have made rich in seeking Us We honor him in finding Us. Whomever We have made to drink from the cup of longing for Us We bring him to the intimacy of meeting Us.�"

  4,127,"They will ask you for a pronouncement concerning women. Say: �God pronounces to you concerning them and what is recited to you in the Book concerning the orphan women to whom you do not give what is prescribed for them for you desire to marry them and the oppressed children and that you deal justly with orphans. Whatever good you do God is ever Knower of it.� He prohibited [men] from coveting that which would lead them to do harm or wrong to oppressed women and orphans. He explained that God is their avenger and that whoever is heedful of God regarding them will not lose anything on account of God but rather will find a beautiful recompense jamīl al-jazāÌ. But whoever abuses them will suffer because of that a pain- ful tribulation alīm al-balāÌ."
