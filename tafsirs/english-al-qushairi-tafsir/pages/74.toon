  3,181,"Verily God has heard the saying of those who said �Indeed God is poor and we are rich.� We shall write down what they have said and their slaying the prophets without right and We shall say �Taste the chastisement of the burning. That is for what your hands have sent before; for God is never unjust toward His servants.� If this address were between created beings it would be a complaint and the complaint to friends about enemies is the way of lovers sunnat al-aḥbāb. It is said that He knew that there were those among the believers who were slandering people and this was an ugly way to speak but He exposed a greater ugliness. This was to show that the ugly speech of the believers was paltry in comparison to the ugliness of the speech of the disbelievers. It is as if He said �Their speech has been ugly in its defamation but the speech of the disbelievers is even uglier since they have described Us in a way that is not appropriate for Us.� [This verse] also alludes to the call to humankind and the [divine] for- bearance with those who quarrel [with that call] for surely God ������ did not deprive them of what He had given them [in this world] in spite of their disregard for His rights. We shall write down what they have said: These words are cause for embarrassment for the neglectful through the most delicate allusion. It means that even if they have forgotten their states and words �We will resurrect for them what We have written against them.� Their speaker said: I have pages in which blame is buried. One day they will be published and the blame will linger. I will be patient until God brings us together and if we meet one day I will speak. That is for what your hands have sent before: for God is never unjust toward His servants: If this were from one created being to another it would be like absolving oneself of blame for what one has done. It is as if He ������ is saying �My servant the punishment that will come to you on that day is because of your sin. If you had not done it We would not punish you.�"

  3,183,"[They are the] same who said �God has already made a covenant with us that we should not believe in any messenger until he brings us an offering to be devoured by fire.� Say: �Messengers have come to you before me with clear proofs and with that which you said. Why did you slay them then if you are truthfulḍ� They fabricated lies about God ������ to excuse their lack of faith saying �Verily we have been commanded not to believe anyone if we do not see him with our own eyes bringing us an offering. He will offer it to the sky and then a fire will come down to take it.� God most high said �say to them that those who have come before me among the prophets [���� ������] have brought you what you have demanded of me in offering but you did not believe.  If I were to accede to you in this you would once again not believe.� Whoever has been kept at a distance by what has already been decreed-if the sun were to speak to him with a clear tongue or the mountains prostrate before him and he were to see all this in a moment of truth deeper knowledge ʿirfān would still not enter his heart and he would only increase in doubt after doubt."
  3,184,"But if they deny you so were denied messengers before you who came bearing clear proofs and the scriptures and the illuminating Book. That is the habitual practice of disbelievers is to deny the messengers. This is what their ancestors used to do ʿalā hadhā l-naḥwi daraja salafuhum and their descendants follow their way wa-bi-hadyihi iqtadā khalafuhum."
  3,185,"Every soul shall taste of death; you shall surely be paid in full your wages on the Day of Resurrection. Whoever is moved away from the fire and admitted to paradise will have triumphed the life of this world is but the comfort of delusion. That is �The cup of death is placed in the palm of every living being. Whoever's soul nafs finds it sweet and agreeable-I bequeath to him the intoxication of ecstatic finding wajd. Whoever swallows it with a frowning face falls into the abyss of rejection radd and is branded by the burning of obstruction ṣadd. Then [there is the Day] of the Resurrection. Whoever is protected from the fire reaches the greatest repose waṣala ilā l-rāḥati al-kubrā and whoever is made to burn in the blazing fire falls into the greatest tribulation waqaʿa fī l-miḥnati al-kubrā.� The life of this world is but the comfort of delusion because what is coming is nigh."
  3,186,"You shall surely be tried in your property; and in your selves and you shall bear from those who were given the scripture before you and from those who are idolaters much hurt but if you are patient and fear-surely that is true resolve. [God] spared [the believers] from what would have been even greater occa- sions of harm by alerting them before the attacks. He taught them two of the best precepts: to prefer patience and to choose to remain still under the streams of the decrees."
