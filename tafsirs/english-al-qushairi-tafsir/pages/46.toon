tafsir[3]{c,v,t}:
  2,270,"And whatever expenditure you expend and whatever vow you make surely God knows it. For the evildoers they have no helpers. He has promised His punishment to some people His reward to others and His knowledge to others. [Those promised punishment or reward] are ordinary people and [those promised knowledge] are the elect. God most high said �And submit patiently to the judgment of your Lord for surely you fare before Our eyes� [52:48]. There is nothing that causes the servant to fall from the eyes of God like opposing the covenants with Him in the heart. So let the aspirant be very wary of letting his soul err in that."
  2,271,"If you proclaim your voluntary almsgivings it is a fine thing; but if you conceal them and give them to the poor that is even better for you; and it will absolve you of your evil deeds. God is aware of what you do. �If you reveal your companionship ṣuḥba with Us and make it public you have behaved generously and well. But if you protect Our secret from the intrusion of intermediaries between us you have kept the conditions of love widād and have raised up the lofty edifice of communion wuṣla.�"
  2,272,"You are not responsible for guiding them; but God guides whomever He will. And whatever good you expend is for yourselves; for then you are expending desiring only God's face and whatever good you expend shall be repaid to you in full and you will not be wronged. �[O Muḥammad] yours is the praiseworthy station al-maqām al-maḥmūd the firmly tied banner al-liwāÌ al-maʿqūd the noble degrees al-rutab al-sharīfa the high waystations al-manāzil al-ʿaliyya and the pleasing practices al-sunan al-marḌiyya. You are the leader of those who come first and those who come last. No one comes close to you and certainly [no one] equals you. But you are not responsible for their guidance. Guidance is among the special characteristics of Our right and not a sliver of it is given to another. O Muḥammad you call them but We guide them.�"
