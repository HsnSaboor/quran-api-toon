tafsir[5]{c,v,t}:
  2,120,"Never will the Jews be pleased with you neither the Christians not until you follow their creed Say: �God's guidance is the true guidance.� And if you were to follow their whims after the knowledge that has come to you you shall have against God neither friend nor helper. �Do not concern yourself with pleasing the enemies after you have received Our good pleasure riḌāÌ for they will not be pleased with you unless you follow their religions and that is impossible. So declare yourself free of them make your difference apparent and show enmity toward them. Know that their reliance on what they find pleasing is the cause of endless wretchedness. Do not worry yourself. Call your community to free them- selves from them and their path and be for Us through Us free of anyone other than Us trusting in Our help for you are through Us and from Us.�"
  2,122,"O children of Israel remember My favor wherewith I favored you and that I have preferred you over all the worlds. His ������ way sunna in His address to the people of Moses ���� ������ is to call them by their proper name saying �O children of Israel remember... � that is �O children of Jacob.� But He addresses this community [of Muḥammad] honorifically saying �O you who believe...�"
  2,123,"And beware of a day when no soul will be requited for another and no compensation will be accepted from it nor will any intercession benefit it neither will they be helped. As for the enemies nothing [that is no payment or compensation] will be accepted from them. As for the friends [the Prophet] ﷺ said �Protect yourself from the fire even if it be by half a date [given in charity].� The intercession of intercessors will not benefit the disbeliever for this is a determination made for each community with their prophet. As for the believers they will benefit in particular from the Prophet's ﷺ intercession. Everyone on that day will be saying �My soul my soul� but our Prophet ﷺ will say �My community my community.�"
  2,125,"And when We appointed the House to be a place of visitation for the people and a sanctuary: �Mention O Muḥammad when We appointed the House meaning the Kaʿba to be a place of visitation for people to come to and a sanctuary for them to return to to make their way to it from every direction. It is a House which I created from stone yet attached to eternity. Whoever looks to the House with the eye of creation is cut off while those who look with the eye of far-reaching vision arrive and connect. Everyone who seeks refuge at that House is secure from the punishment of the hereafter if he seeks refuge to show veneration and respect ʿalā jihati al-iʿẓām wa-l-iḥtirām and repent from sins wa-l-tawbati ʿan al-āthām.� It is said that the House was built of stone but it is a stone that attracts hearts just as a magnet attracts iron. [What kind of house is itḍ] A house... Its shade causes whomever comes to it to remain in the courtyard of security amn. A house... Whoever glances upon it receives the good news of forgive- ness attained. A house... Subtleties circumambulate the heart of whoever circum- ambulates it. One circumambulation is by another circumambulation and one circuit is by another circuit. Is the reward of goodness anything but goodnessḍ [55:60]. A house... Whatever one spends of one's wealth to reach it is not lost. A house... Whatever one withholds from it is without profit. Whoever visits it forgets any other place of visitation and abandons his [own] regions. A house... No distance is reckoned too far to it. Visiting it is not to be neglected for fear of unpleasant occurrences or harmful attacks. This is a house which possesses no harm for the lifeblood of the poor fuqarāÌ. A house... Whoever holds back from visiting it lacks noble-heartedness futuwwa or is deficient in love maḥabba. A house... The heart of the one who holds back from it is harder than stones. A house... When the rays of its lights fall upon someone he is made to forget suns and moons. A house... One is not so much amazed by those who stay away from it but rather by how those who come to it can leave! Take to yourselves Abraham's station for a place of prayer; A servant was raised up on his feet for the sake of God ������ and his footprints made a qibla for all Muslims to honor him for all time until the resurrection."
  2,126,"And when Abraham said �My Lord make this land secure and pro- vide its people with fruits; such of them as believe in God and the Last Day� He said �And whoever disbelieves to him I shall give enjoyment a little then I shall compel him to the chastisement of the fire-how evil a journey's end!� And when Abraham said 'My Lord make this land secure': The request was answered because it was not adulterated by the worldly concern of the servant. Abraham's request was not for his own concern ḥaẓẓ but rather for the right ḥaqq of his Lord may He be exalted and glorified. When Abraham was mindful of the required etiquette in seeking provision for those who believed they were granted that-but so were those who did not believe. [On the other hand] when he spoke about leadership saying �And of my seedḍ� [2:125] without [divine] permission [the request] was denied and it was said to him �My covenant shall not reach the evildoers� [2:125]."
