tafsir[5]{c,v,t}:
  4,45,"Have you not seen those who were given a share of the Book purchas- ing error and desiring that you should err from the wayḍ God has better knowledge of your enemies. God suffices as a Protector God suffices as a Helper. Some from among the Jews distort the words from their contexts and they say �We have heard and we disobey and hear as one who does not hear� and �Mind us� twisting with their tongues and slandering religion. If they had said �We have heard and obey� and �Hear� and �Consider us� it would have been better for them and more upright but God has cursed them for their unbelief so they believe not except a few. They practiced a deception but did not realize the way in which He deceived them in that they were given the book and then were deprived of the bless- ing of understanding so that they distorted [the words] and persisted [in their unbelief]. Some from among the Jews distort the words... They acted shamelessly toward the Messenger ﷺ and refused to show him respect so they were punished with doubt concerning his affair. Those who acted shamelessly devised a barrier between themselves and the blessing of [the Prophet's] companionship and the bounties of serving him. If they had hastened [instead] to reject the envy they felt and had accepted his state with venera- tion and honored [him] they would have found blessing in following him and happiness in both abodes. But how could they be otherwise when what had already been determined distanced themḍ They were kept back by fate qisma from the carpet of service khidma. There is no maneuvering that can help those held back by the [divine] decrees."

  4,47,"O you who have been given the scripture believe in what We have revealed confirming what is with you before We obliterate faces and turn them inside out or curse them as We cursed those of the Sabbath and God's command is done. In We obliterate faces and turn them inside out the allusion is to the turn- ing away of hearts from spiritual desire irāda to the states of the people of habit ahl al-ʿāda so that despite the abundance of His calls to reject the present world they no longer pay any attention to them."
  4,50,"Have you not seen those who praise themselves for purityḍ Nay God purifies whom He will and they shall not be wronged a single date-thread. Consider how they invent falsehood against God and that suffices for a clear sin. Whoever relies on what people say about his purity or seeks the satisfaction of the elite over that of ordinary people is someone who praises himself for purity. Looking to the self is the greatest veil. Whoever imagines that he is purifying himself with litanies or efforts he undertakes by what he does or does not do is veiled by his own ignorance. Consider how they invent... alludes to those who let loose their tongues and claim what they have not actualized. The one who invents in this way does not say anything but that ears reject him and hearts are driven away. Then when he becomes silent he returns to a heart laid waste."
  4,51,"Have you not seen those who were given a share of the Book how they believe in al-Jibt and al-Ṭāghūt and say to the disbelievers �These are more rightly guided than the believers�ḍ Those are the ones whom God has cursed; and he whom God has cursed you will never find for him any helper. The Ṭāghūt of each person is his lower self and his whim-the idol he seeks among that which is other than [God]. When someone pays heed to a person or looks to a reason or turns to a cause or obeys a whim that thing is his jibt and his Ṭāghūt.61 The companions of al-Jibt and al-Ṭāghūt deserve the curse which is being expelled from the carpet of service ʿubūdiyya and veiled from witnessing lordship rubūbiyya."
