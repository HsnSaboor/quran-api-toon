tafsir[5]{c,v,t}:
  3,101,"How can you disbelieve while you have God's verses recited to you and His Messenger is in your midstḍ Whoever holds fast to God he is guided to a straight path. It is not right that the shade of disbelief should pass over one whose heart [has seen] the rising suns of deeper knowledge ʿirfān. For surely when day comes night slips away. Whoever holds fast to God: The one who holds fast to God has [in truth] only found the holding fast from God. How could those who have not been guided by God hold fast to Godḍ The guidance from Him in the beginning bidāya causes you [to] hold fast in the end nihāya. Your holding fast does not cause the guidance hidāya. The true state of affairs of holding fast is sincerity taking oneself to Him persevering in the flight to Him and continuing to appeal for His help. Whoever has the covering of sepa- ration removed from his innermost self realizes that there is not an atom that belongs to or comes from anything other than God. The people who hold fast to Him are those who are held fast by Him. The leader of those who come first and those who come last ﷺ said �I seek refuge in You from You.� Whoever holds fast to Him through himself -without being effaced from his own strength and power in his holding-his homeland is idolatry shirk but he is unaware."
  3,103,"And hold fast to God's bond together and do not scatter; remember God's grace upon you when you were enemies and He brought your hearts together so that by His grace you became brothers; and you were upon the brink of a pit of fire; but He delivered you from it. So God makes clear to you His signs that you might be guided. Holding fast to His bond ������ is clinging to the traces of the intermediary āthār al-wāsiṬa-the noble one ʿazīz ﷺ. This [comes] from confirm- ing what is true and right taḥaqquq and remaining devoted taʿalluq to the Book and the sunna. It is rightly said that [the words] and hold fast to God's bond are spoken to the elite khawāṣṣ while [the words] and hold fast to God [4:146 and 22:78] are spoken to the elect of the elect khāṣṣ al-khāṣṣ. Whoever turns from His auspicious occurrences sawāniḥ back to his own choosing and devising iḥtiyāl his own thinking and reasoning istidlāl his own ways of knowing and behaving ashkāl; and takes refuge in the shade of his own planning tadbīr seeking illumination by the light of his own intel- lect and speculation tafkīr-such a person is denied the shade of divine solicitude and is left with his unfortunate state. And do not scatter: Scattering or separation tafriqa is the most intense punishment. It is the companion to associating others with God shirk. And remember God's grace upon you when you were enemies: They were enemies when they remained with their worldly concerns turning toward the narrowness of human nature and competing with one another as befits the stinginess of [their] lower selves. And He brought your hearts together through deliverance from the cap- tivity of created things. He drove away afflictions from their innermost selves. Then what they sought together became one thing. If a thousand people were to be brought together in one pursuit they would in truth be one. So that by His grace you became brothers: His grace is His safeguard- ing ʿiṣma of you as brothers united in aim and aspiration annihilated from the worldly concerns of the lower self and the furtive impulses of stinginess and avarice. And you were upon the brink of a pit of fire by your being held captive to the objects of your desire munākum and [being] bound by the shackles of your worldly concerns and whims hawākum."
  3,106,"The day when some faces are blackened and some faces whitened. As for those whose faces are blackened �did you disbelieve after you had believedḍ Then taste the chastisement for what you disbelieved!� But for those whose faces are whitened they shall be in God's mercy abiding therein. The faces of the lords of pretensions daʿāwā will be blackened while the faces of the companions of meanings maʿānī will be whitened. The faces of the people of unveilings kushūfāt will be whitened through illumina- tion. The faces of the companions of the veil ḥijāb will be blackened with shame covered with dust taʿlūhā ghabara and overcast with gloom wa-tarhaquhā qatara. It is said that whoever's heart is white today his face will be white in the future and the one who is the opposite his situation will be the reverse. It is said that whoever turns away from created beings before His auspi- cious occurrences sawāniḥ his face will become white with the spirit of having committed his affairs [to God] rūḥ al-tafwīḌ. Whoever's heart is attached to what is other [than God] with wants and needs ḥawāÌij his heart will become black [and] his face [will be] in the dust of covetousness. As for those whose faces have become white they will be in intimacy and ease rawḥ. As for those whose faces have become blackened they will [experience] tribulations and lamentation nawḥ."

  3,108,"Those are the verses of God which We recite to you in truth and God desires not any injustice for the worlds. To God belongs all that is in the heavens and in the earth and to Him all matters are returned. We make our address to you continuous in all times in all things small and large a cultivation of the way of love widād. And God desires not any injustice for the worlds: How could it be pos- sible to ascribe injustice to Him in the determining of events taqdīr and existence wujūd when all created beings are His creation and what has been determined for them is His wise determination ḥukmḍ To God belongs all that is in the heavens and in the earth by way of possession milk and to Him all matters are returned by way of determi- nation ḥukm."
