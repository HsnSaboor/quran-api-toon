  2,85,"And when We made a covenant with the children of Israel: �You shall not worship any other than God; and be good to parents and the near of kin; and to orphans and to the needy; and speak well to men; and observe the prayer and pay the alms� then you turned away; all but a few of you rejecting. And when We made a covenant with you: �Shed no blood among you nor turn out your own people from your homes.� Then you confirmed it and you bore witness. Then there you are killing one another and expelling a party of you from their habitations conspiring against them in sin and enmity and if they come to you as captives you ransom them; yet their expulsion was forbidden you. What do you believe in part of the Book and disbelieve in partḍ And if they come to you as captives you ransom them that is �Just as you protect their rights by ransoming them so must you restrain your hands from them and forswear expelling them from their homelands. When you uphold some of what has been made obligatory for you what keeps you from doing the rest of what you have been commanded to doḍ Do you not know that whoever picks and chooses in what he has been commanded so that he believes in some parts and disbelieves in others has the reward for his deeds nullified because of what he has neglectedḍ� What shall be the requital of those of you who do that but degrada- tion in the life of this world; and on the Day of Resurrection to be returned to the most terrible of chastisementḍ And God is not heedless of what you do. That is they thought that what they did would benefit them but in the hereafter it will be disclosed to them that everything that they did when it was combined with what was damaging and stripped of sincerity and devotion was not accepted from them. The captives are of different types. The rescue of the captive drowning in the sea of whim hawā is to be directed to guidance. The ransom of the captive who remains in the hands of whisperings wasāwis is to show him the way to certainty by the glimmers of proofs."
  2,86,"Those are the ones who have purchased the life of this world at the price of the hereafter-for them the punishment shall not be lightened neither shall they be helped. Those who have preferred anything over [God] have lost in this world and the hereafter. As they have said: People turned away from us without cause or sense. If they have no need of us we have even less need of them."
  2,87,"And We gave Moses the scripture and after him We sent successive mes- sengers and We gave Jesus son of Mary the clear proofs and We confirmed him with the holy spirit and whenever there came to you a messenger with what your souls did not desire you became arrogant; and some you called liars and some you slayḍ The allusion is that �We [God] delivered the address to them and made one messenger follow after another all calling to the same thing. But they listened to the call of the callers with the ear of whim hawā; they accepted what their lower selves found pleasurable and rejected what their whims ahwāÌ found troublesome. They were characterized by this self-serving desire and moreover became servants ʿabadū to it. The [human] attributes of the worshiper ʿābid became the object of worship maʿbūd.� What a terrible affliction is upon them!"
  2,88,"And they say: �Our hearts are encased.� Nay but God has cursed them for their unbelief; and little will they believe. If there had been anything in them free of pretension it would have become easy to find meanings [from God's signs and scripture]. But when [they must] recognize the truth the fangs of pretenders are bared... It is said: When tears flow down cheeks The one who is crying is distinguished from the one who is only pretending."
