tafsir[6]{c,v,t}:
  2,70,"�... a golden cow bright in color gladdening to beholders.� They said �Pray to your Lord for us that He make clear to us what she may be; the cows are all alike to us; and if God wills we shall then be guided.� Just as her [bright] color would have been perceived by the eyes the allu- sion here is to those of the people of the story ahl al-qiṣṣa whose witnessing overwhelms the hearts [of others] because of that which is clothed with the garment of invincibility jabarūt and made to rise from the witness of the unseen. One notices that someone like this is oblivious to human states and is overtaken by the remembrance of the Real. Thus in the transmitted tradition: The friends of God are those who when they are seen God is remembered."
  2,71,"He said �He says she shall be a cow not broken to plow the earth or to water the tillage with no blemish on her.� They said �Now you have brought the truth�; and so they sacrificed her even though they very nearly did not. Just as this cow was not to have been broken in for work nor worn out for the purposes of profits there was to be no color in her inconsistent with the overall grandeur of her color. The allusion in this is to the people of divine friendship walāya who do not exert themselves with anyone or anything other [than God] which is to say that they do not seek to obtain anything through secondary causes and who do not rely in their hearts on external appearances and simulacra. They do not trust in their own choices and contrivance. They are not prey to the claims of desire nor game in the claws of the present world. Carnal desires do not rule them and no human authority controls them. They do not strive at all to obtain what they desire and are not concerned with attaining what they wish for. There is no mark of others upon them nor any sign of [their seeking anything through] secondary causes for they are supported by God annihilated from all else nay effaced as God turns them this way and that. God has conquered their hearts. Just as their object of worship maʿbūd is God so their only aim maqṣūd is God. Just as their aim maqṣūd is God so what they bear witness to mashhūd is God and what they have found mawjūd is God. Nay they are effaced in God and [only] God remains after them. The one who spoke for them recited: If you want me to be pleased and you to be pleased and to take the reins of our life together then look at the world through my eyes and listen with my ears and speak with my tongue. They said �Now you have brought the truth�; and so they sacrificed her even though they very nearly did not. They sought a stratagem for themselves but when their stratagems failed they submitted to the decree and were rid of the difficulties of the demands. If they had done what they were commanded to do [straight away] their misery would not have been doubled."
  2,72,"And when you killed a living soul and disputed thereon-and God disclosed what you were hiding One who is disloyal is afraid and out of fear that his secret will become manifest relies on concealment deception denial and evasion. His fault ʿawāruhu is inevitably discovered his secrets asrāruhu exposed and the coverings astāruhu fall because of the shame of his action. God most high said �and God disclosed what you were hiding.�"
  2,73,"so We said �Smite him with part of it�; God brings to life the dead and He shows you His signs so that you might understand. God ������ wanted to give life to the dead man so that he could expose his killer through the testimony [of the slain] so He commanded them to kill one of their animals and made it the cause of bringing the slain man to life. The allusion here is to anyone who desires the life of his heart; he will only attain it by sacrificing his lower self since the heart of anyone who sacrifices his lower self through struggle mujāhadāt comes to life by the lights of witnessing mushāhadāt. Likewise when God wants someone's reputation to live forever He causes his reputation in this world to pass into obscurity."
  2,75,"Are you then so eager that they should believe you seeing there is a party of them that heard God's word and then tampered with it and that after they had comprehended it knowinglyḍ He informed them of [the status] of their belief and related that after hearing the address of God ������ they engaged in tampering [with it] and altering [it]: �Why would they believe you when they already heard by means of the messageḍ How can those who do not remain in a state of faith imān after eyewitnessing ʿiyān believe by means of demonstrative proof burhānḍ That which does not hold true for the Real does not hold true for you. How can those who are not ashamed before the Real be ashamed before youḍ�"
  2,76,"And when they meet those who believe they say �We believe�; but when they go in private one to another they say: �Do you speak to them of what God has disclosed to you so that they may thereby dispute with you before your Lordḍ Have you no understandingḍ� Do they not know that God knows what they keep secret and what they proclaimḍ They encouraged one another among themselves to reject the Real and to hide the situation from the Muslims. But they did not know that God was informing His Messenger ���� ������ of their secrets and that a light the Real makes manifest cannot be extinguished by the efforts of anyone other than Him. When the tongue agrees but the mind162 objects it only increases separation."
