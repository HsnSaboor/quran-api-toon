tafsir[2]{c,v,t}:
  2,231,"When you divorce women and they have reached their term then retain them honorably or set them free honorably; do not retain them in order to hurt [them]; whoever does that has wronged his soul; take not God's verses in mockery and remember God's grace upon you and the Book and the wisdom He has revealed to you to exhort you therewith; and fear God and know that God has knowledge of all things. The verse contains the command to goodly marital relations which means abandoning anger and stubborn bickering with the wife. So either release [her] without being rough min ghayri jafāÌ or practice true companion- ship as it should be carried out ʿalā sharṬi al-wafāÌ."
  2,232,"When you divorce women and they have reached their term do not debar them from marrying their [former] husbands when they have agreed together honorably. That is an admonition for whoever of you believe in God and the Last Day; that is purer for you and cleaner. God knows and you know not. The verse contains a prohibition for guardians against hurting [the women under their protection] abandoning the fierceness of the time of ignorance jāhiliyya and yielding to the decree of God to allow [divorced] women to marry if they wish it without indignation or rage. Rather [the mes- sage is] �since you were sufficiently pleased to betroth her to a mate it is prohibited to [then] oppress her.� Letting go of the [baser] human instincts by subjugating the lower self is a more difficult struggle [than the fierce ways of the time of ignorance] and a more sincere way of behaving for the sake of God."
