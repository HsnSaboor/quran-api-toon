tafsir[5]{c,v,t}:
  3,166,"And what afflicted you the day the two hosts encountered was by God's leave and that He might know the believers. And that He might also know the hypocrites when it was said to them �Come now fight in the way of God or defend [yourselves]� they said �If we knew how to fight we would follow you.� That day they were nearer to unbelief than to belief saying with their mouths that which was not in their hearts. And God knows best what they hide. He lightened the grave calamity met by the believers and possessors of insight on the Day of Uḥud by saying that the encounter was by God's leave. Surely a trial that afflicts [one] by God's leave is sweeter than honey and more desirable than any blessing. Then He spoke of those who were not sincere comrades how they offered excuses and were lazy. Similarly when the one who is tired wants to break things off he becomes weary of being together and says �That was that.� Saying with their mouths that which was not in their hearts: Verily they gave honey to drink [to their enemies] but He plotted to put poison in it for them. And they schemed; and God schemed; and God is the best of schemers [3:54]."

  3,168,"Those who said to their brothers while they themselves stayed put �Had they obeyed us they would not have been slain.� Say: �Then avert death from yourselves if you speak the truth.� Those who relied upon their lower selves-having been seduced by them to prefer their own whims-and then opposed those who gave themselves over to the decrees of divine fate said �If only they had heeded the warning about going out to the battle they would have been safe.� These thoughts are blameworthy and these hearts have retreated from witnessing the true nature of things. Say to them O Muḥammad �[Then] extend the life of your souls istadīmū lil-anfusikum al-ḥayāt and defend them from the attacks of death wa-idfaʿū ʿanhā hujūma al-wafāt.� How would they be able to do thatḍ How preposterous!"
  3,170,"Count not those who were slain in God's way as dead but rather liv- ing with their Lord provided for [by Him]. Rejoicing in what God has given them of His bounty and rejoicing for the sake of those who have not joined them but are left behind that no fear shall befall them neither shall they grieve. Life in remembrance of the Real-after the lower selves have been anni- hilated in the good pleasure of the Real-is more perfect than remaining with the blessings of created beings and being veiled from the Real. It is said that the one whose heir is the Living is one who does not disappear and cannot die even if he is killed: Surely bodies have been brought into existence for death so the slaying of a human being in God without doubt is best. And rejoicing for the sake of those who have not joined them but are left behind: Those who know that their loved ones are waiting for them while they are in comfort and ease [in the garden] would not take pleasure in living without being with them."
  3,173,"Those to whom people said �The people have gathered against you therefore fear them�; but that increased them in faith and they said �God is sufficient for us an excellent Guardian is He.� [Whenever] events in the present world confused them outwardly the gleams from unveilings Ṭawāliʿ min al-kushūfāt opened up for them in their innermost selves asrār and they increased in one level of certainty after another. Among the signs of certainty is the reliance of hearts in God alone with the severing of any hope of imagined aid and support from created beings."
