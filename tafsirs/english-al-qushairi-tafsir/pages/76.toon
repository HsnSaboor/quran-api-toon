tafsir[4]{c,v,t}:
  3,196,"Let it not delude you that the disbelievers go to and fro in the land a little enjoyment; then their abode is hell-an evil cradling! �Do not let any doubt seize you thinking that they have any value or worth with Us. Rather the days are few and breaths limited. Afterward there will be grief upon grief ḥasarāt mutarādifa and sorrow upon sorrow aḥzān mutaḌāʿifa.�"

  3,198,"But those who fear their Lord-for them shall be gardens underneath which rivers flow abiding therein; a hospitality from God Himself. That which is with God is better for the pious. �The state of those whom we have branded with the ignominy of separation is wretched while the state and intimacy of those whom We have raised in degrees for Our sake is blessed.� They attain the lasting reward waṣalū ilā l-thawābi al-muqīm and remain in communion and felicity wa-baqū fī l-wuṣlati wa-l-naʿīm. What God has stored away for them is better than what they had hoped for by their own choosing."
  3,199,"Verily there are some among the people of the scripture who believe in God and what has been revealed to you and what has been revealed to them humble before God not purchasing with the verses of God a small price. Those-their wage is with their Lord. God is swift at reckoning. He means those who have been favored by a beautiful destiny-they are with the friends of God in being blessed fa-hum maʿa awliyāÌ Allāh niʿmatan just as they are with them in their destiny kamā kānū maʿahum qismatan."
