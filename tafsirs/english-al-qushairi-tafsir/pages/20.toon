tafsir[5]{c,v,t}:
  2,127,"And when Abraham raised up the foundations of the House and Ishmael with him: �Our Lord! Receive this from us. Truly You are the Hearing the Knowing. The success of the request is in the sincerity of the supplication nujḥu al-suÌāl fī ṣidqi al-ibtihāl. When the two of them humbly sought aid in prayer He gave them help and fulfilled the request. Truly You are the Hearing of our speech the Knowing of our states."
  2,128,"Our Lord! And make us submissive to You and of our seed a com- munity submissive to You; and show us our holy rites and relent to us. Surely You are the Relenting the Merciful. [That is] �Submissive muslimīn yielding to Your decree so that not one vein of ours throbs without Your good pleasure. Make from our seed a community submissive to You so that after us they will take our place in upholding Your rights.� What a difference between one who seeks someone to inherit his wealth man yaṬlubu wārithan li-mālihi and one who seeks a deputy after him to perform acts of obedience to Him in his states man yaṬlubu nāÌiban... fī aḥwālihi. [That is] �Show us our holy rites since there is no way to know what conforms [to Your will] except by the path that God granted success and communication.� [That is] �And relent to us after we carry out all that You have com- manded us to do so that we do not look to what we do and do not do but turn back to You from witnessing our actions so there is no danger of hidden idolatry al-shirk al-khafī in imagining anything from us or through us.�"
  2,132,"And Abraham enjoined upon his sons this and [so did] Jacob 'My sons God has chosen for you the [true] religion see that you die not save in submission.' He related that Abraham ���� ������ enjoined his sons as did Jacob ���� ������ who said �Do not let death come upon you except in the state of submission islām.� Their laws even if they differed in details were of one origin. The spring of unity tawḥīd is not divided into two.  words of God most high �God has chosen for you the [true] religion� were good news. By [these words] their desire to meet the demands of submission islām became strong. For when they realized that God ������ had chosen them for that [islām] they knew with certainty that He would help them and make it easy for them to uphold the rightful due of submission islām."
  2,133,"Or were you witnesses when death came to Jacobḍ When he said to his sons �What will you worship after meḍ� They said �We will worship your God All of them ḍ followed one way in declaring [God's] oneness tawḥīd and submission islām. They inherited that one after another from their forefathers and [they] were the people of the house of intimacy deserving of nearness and purified in truth by God. and the God of your fathers Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac One God to Him we submit.� [Jacob's sons] did not say �Our God� out of respect for [Jacob's] special status inasmuch as they accepted his superiority and saw themselves as attached to his station maqām. [Rather] they said of themselves that they were followers of [Abraham Ishmael and Isaac] when they said �and to Him we submit.�"
  2,134,"That is a community that has passed away; theirs is what they have earned and yours is what you have earned; you will not be asked about what they did. The Real ������ sent down to each [community] its place and singled out for each one its status according to His decree ḥukm. There is no news about their outward forms and no trace remaining of what distinguished each group from the others. Each is a king in his own region and each has a celestial sphere revolving in felicity."
