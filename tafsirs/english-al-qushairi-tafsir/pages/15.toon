tafsir[7]{c,v,t}:
  2,94,"Say: �If the abode of the hereafter with God is purely yours and not for other people then long for death-if you speak truly.� But they will never long for it because of that which their own hands have sent before them. God knows the evildoers. Among the signs of ardent longing ishtiyāq is the desire for death while in the best of health and well-being. Whoever is absolutely and without any doubt confident that the garden is his ardently longs for it. But they did not long for the garden-and God ������ said that they will never long for it-and this information was a miracle for the Messenger ﷺ since it was as He had said. In this is good news for the believers who ardently long for death; there is forgiveness for them. He only bestows the ardent longing on them so that it may be actualized [when] they reach the garden. Of old it was said �For the negligent shame will suffice on the Day of the Meeting.� God most high said �But they will never long for it because of that which their own hands have sent before them.�"

  2,96,"And you shall find them the people most covetous of life and the idola- ters; any one of them would love that he might be given life for a thousand years; yet his being given life shall not budge him from the chastisement. God sees what they do. Love of life in this world is the result of heedlessness ghafla of God. The worst heedlessness is their excessive love to remain in this world. The state of the believer is the opposite of this. Those who are heedless and insolent are eager for life only because they know of their failure to be obedient. The runaway slave does not want to be returned to his master. But for believ- ers the transition [of death] to One from whom only good is expected is better than remaining with those against whose evil they are not secure. The prolonging of life in spite of the certainty of death holds no value for them since [death] comes unexpectedly and life is cut off. What is coming is near. When [one's] life span is completed there is no averting the assaults of the appointed time from the shoulders of hope fa-lā maradda li-hujūmi al-ajal ʿalā aktāfi al-amal."
  2,98,"Say: �Whoever is an enemy to Gabriel-he it was that brought it down upon your heart by the leave of God confirming what was before it a guid- ance and good tidings for the believers. Whoever is an enemy to God and His angels and His messengers and Gabriel and Michael-then surely God is an enemy to the disbelievers.� The Jews claimed that Gabriel did not come with good that they did not love him and that if it had been Michael they would have believed in him. The Real ������ showed them to be liars when He said �Whoever is an enemy to Gabriel [thinking] he did not bring good what good is greater than the QurÌān that descended through himḍ� Then He said that whoever is an enemy to Gabriel and Michael God is his enemy. Surely the messenger of the Beloved to the highly-esteemed beloved [Muḥammad] has a noble status and weighty rank. The enmity of the disbelievers does not harm Gabriel-the Real ������ ������ is his protector walī. Whoever is an enemy of Gabriel God is his enemy. How mighty and glori- fied is this status! How grand is His exaltedness!"
  2,99,"And We have revealed to you clear proofs; and none disbelieves inthem except the wicked. Why whenever they make a covenant does a party of them reject itḍ Nay but most of them are disbelievers. One disbelieves in His clear signs only when one's eyes are blocked from perceiving and one's fate from God has already been determined as unfor- tunate. There is no sense in anyone who denies that day is day. Likewise there is no union for anyone who has not been assisted by lights and insights from the Real. Why whenever they made a covenant...: their predetermined fate sābiq al-taqdīr confounded them and their subsequent contrivances lāḥiq al-tadbīr broke their covenant. God prevails over His affair."

  2,101,"When there came to them a messenger from God confirming what was with them a party of those who had been given the scripture cast away the scripture of God behind their backs as though they did not know. They denied the messengers of the Real that came to their hearts by means of intuitions khawāṬir and [they] belied the messengers who came to them outwardly. O ignorance in which there is not a sliver of deeper knowledge ʿirfān! O deprivation whose companion is disappointment khidhlān!"
