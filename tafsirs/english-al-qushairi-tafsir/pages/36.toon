  2,225,"God will not take you to task for a slip in your oaths; but He will take you to task for what your hearts have earned; and God is Forgiving Forbearing. What the tongue says inadvertently does not have much importance either for good or bad but what is hidden in the recesses of the heart ḌamāÌir and contained in its inner secrets sarāÌir in [terms of] genuine intentions and strong resolutions-that will be taken into account. If it is good there will be a beautiful recompense jazāÌun jamīl and if it is bad there will be prolonged distress ʿanāÌun Ṭawīl."
  2,227,"But if they resolve upon divorce; surely God is Hearing Knowing. If he no longer wants the right of companionship and has confirmed his resolve to separate from her surely God is Hearing Knowing aware of his state and his secret. If any remorse comes to him he should not cover it up by denying356 the divorce for God ������ knows that he has divorced her. When separation is difficult [God] provides solace for the woman say- ing [He is] Hearing that is �We hear the one who is desolated by [the words of her husband] and this is a comfort for her from the Real ������.�"
  2,228,"Divorced women shall wait by themselves for three periods. He commanded divorced women to wait out of respect for spousal rela- tions. This means �If the relationship has been cut off between the two of you observe the condition of fulfilling [the waiting period] for the sake of what occurred in the past in the relationship. Do not put others quickly in place of [the former spouse]. Be patient until the allotted period has passed.� Do you not see that the bride whose marriage was not consum- mated is not commanded to undergo a waiting period since there were no spousal relations between the two of themḍ And it is not lawful for them to hide what God has created in their wombs if they believe in God and the Last Day. This means that even if the tie between the two of you has been severed do not sever what God has established in the parental relationship. Their mates have a better right to restore them This means that the one with the prior relationship [the husband who ini- tiated the divorce] has a better right to restore the breach in the marriage [before the wife's marrying again]. in such time if they desire to set things right; This means that the [husband's] intention to return should be to set things right in the estrangement that has occurred not to prolong the waiting period for her if he has decided to divorce her after he has taken her back. women shall have rights similar to those due from them with justice; This means if he has a right over her for what he has expended in wealth she has a right in the situation for [her] past service. but their men have a degree above them; God is Mighty Wise. [The man has the degree] in merit faḌīla but she has an advantage mazīya in weakness and human vulnerability."
  2,230,"If he divorces her she shall not be lawful to him after that until she marries another husband. If he divorces her then neither of them would be at fault [if they] return to each other A man finds it unbearable for his wife to marry another so [God] prevents him from choosing separation with the intention of keeping her from remarrying. He explains that once he has separated from her she will not be lawful for him until she does what he would find unbearable and that is a second marriage. So [this will make him] cautious as much as he is able in [initiating] divorce. Then He said �If he divorces her� meaning the spouse �then neither of them would be at fault [if they] return to each other� meaning if she remarries the first husband. Here the allusion is that love's hold on the heart makes what would otherwise be hard to endure easy for if after separating the spouses regret their lost union and then feel the greatest remorse there is no fault in their returning to each other. But the woman in this circumstance is protected from her husband by the threat of another husband for the husband would himself be making that possible [if he were to divorce her three times]. if they think that they will maintain God's bounds. Those are God's bounds which He makes clear to a people who have knowledge. This means that after they know how much they need each other as com- panions they will not separate again. The one who spoke for them said: I swore that if I were to meet you one more time I would never separate from you a second time."
