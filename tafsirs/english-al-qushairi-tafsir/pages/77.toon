tafsir[5]{c,v,t}:
  4,2,"Give the orphans their property and do not exchange the evil for the good and absorb not their property into your property; surely that is a great crime: Whoever has been given charge over others and then acts unjustly toward those under his charge his adversary is his Lord for He ������ avenges His servants what He will not avenge for His own sake. If the protector of the orphan acts with justice and beneficence then his right is protected by God and if he behaves badly and aggressively God is his adversary."
  4,3,"If you fear that you will not act justly toward the orphans marry such women as seem good to you two or three or four but if you fear you will not be equitable then only one or what your right hands own; thus it is likelier that you will not be unjust. And give women their dowries as a free gift; God granted free men the right to marry four women at the same time. He mandated justice between [these wives] so the servant must respect what is obligatory. If he knows that he can uphold this obligation in a proper manner the choice is a permitted one. But if he knows that he will fall short in meeting this obligation he should not do it for he is accountable for what is obligatory. but if they are pleased to offer you any of it of their own accord consume it with wholesome appetite. This suggests that the food of the chivalrous fityān and generous askhiyāÌ is wholesome because they only feed others from good-hearted- ness. The food of the miserly is rotten because they look only to themselves and feed others out of obligation not good-heartedness. [The Prophet] ﷺ said �The food of the generous is a remedy while the food of the miser is a disease.�"

  4,5,"But do not give to the foolish your property which God has assigned to you as maintenance; provide for them thereof and clothe them and speak to them decent words. The foolish are those who keep you from the Real and distract you from the Lord. The foolish are those dependents and children who prefer their worldly portions over the rights of God most high. Which God has assigned to you as maintenance: To keep to pleasing actions in the situation is better for you than exposing yourself to disgrace petitioning begging and contriving. For the liberation of the heart it is better to be generous than withholding and [better] to rely on patience. But as for forming the intention to beg or making yourself and your dependents a burden on other people it is more appropriate to hold on to a sufficient amount from what God has assigned to you. Then you can be generous with what is in excess of your needs. Provide for them thereof and clothe them and speak to them decent words: If you have more than enough to help them today do not with- hold that which you know they need out of fear of future poverty. If your hand is constrained from providing support do not let your tongue loose in speaking ill. It is said that when your lower self calls you to spend in a useless way you are the most foolish of the foolish so do not yield to it."
  4,6,"Try well the orphans until they reach the age of marrying; then if you perceive in them maturity rushd deliver their property to them; consume it not wastefully and in haste lest they should grow up. If any man is rich let him be abstinent; if he is poor let him consume honorably.  And when you deliver to them their property take witnesses over them. God suffices as a reckoner. To perceive maturity means [to perceive] decency and integrity. It is gen- erosity and the preservation of honor keeping company with elders and striving to look to the good and to perform acts of devotion as decreed by the command. It is said that the one who is mature rashīd is the one who is guided to his Lord. When a need arises in him he does not rely on his own power or strength his own planning or choosing."
