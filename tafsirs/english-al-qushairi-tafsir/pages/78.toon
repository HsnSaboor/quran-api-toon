tafsir[4]{c,v,t}:
  4,7,"To the men belongs a share of what parents and kinsmen leave and to the women belongs a share of what parents and kinsmen leave whether it be little or much-an obligatory share. The determining of inheritance does not vary according to virtue or good qualities nor is it different due to fault defect or sin. If a man dies leav- ing two sons their rights are equivalent even if one of them is pious and God-fearing and the other wicked and disobedient. The God-fearing one does not get more because of his fear of God and the wicked one does not get less because of his wickedness. The deeper meaning in this is that inheritance is a gift from God that comes before [any action or virtue] so it is shared equally by the pious and the wicked. Likewise the determining of faith is a gift that comes before [any action or virtue] for Muslims. God most high said �Then We bequeathed the Book to those of Our servants whom We chose [35:32]. Then He said Yet some of them are those who wrong themselves and some of them are moderate and some are those who take the lead in [performing] good works by the leave of God. That is the greatest favor!� [35:32]."
  4,8,"And when the division is attended by kinsmen and orphans and the poor grant them out of it; and speak to them honorable words. When the division of the inheritance is attended by those who are [to be] the possessors of its shares and are the legal heirs and others [also] attend who have no [legal] portion and who are poor do not deprive them of that. If the legal heir is a minor make to [the poor] a goodly promise saying to them �When the child grows up we will tell him to give you something.� This is the meaning of His words and speak to them honorable words. In this is a subtle allusion to those who have sinned. When they are present at His court in the future and the Real ������ pardons those who were obedient and gives them the rewards for their deeds He will not deprive the poor Muslims18 among you of the pardon if God wills after their having been among the family of faith ahl al-īmān. Similarly you were not present on the day of the division19-you have no prior entitlement. In what you know of [God] He has made you deserving ahhala20 by His favor in spite of His knowledge of the lapses that will occur in your states."
  4,9,"And let them fear those who if they leave behind them weak offspring would be afraid for them; let them fear God and speak pertinent words. He explained in this verse that what the Muslim should accumulate for his dependents is not wealth but fear of God taqwā and righteousness ṣalāḥ for He did not say �so let them gather their wealth let them multiply real estate for them and let them leave behind household goods.� Rather He said let them fear God for He looks after the righteous."
  4,11,"God charges you concerning your children to the male the equivalent of the portion of two females; and if they be women more than two then for them two-thirds of what he leaves; but if she be one then to her a half; and to his parents to each one of the two the sixth of what he leaves if he has a child; but if he has no child and his heirs are his parents then to his mother a third; or if he has siblings to his mother a sixth after any bequest that he may bequeath or any debt. The word �charge� waṣiyya here means �command� amr. He ������ established two principles for what is owed to inheritors from the inheri- tance-the obligatory portions farḌ and the inheritance by the group of relatives taʿṣīb. The inheritance by the group of relatives is stronger than the apportionment because it might include all of the wealth [of the estate] whereas the greater part of the portions cannot exceed two-thirds [of it]. The division [of the estate] begins with those who have claim to the ordained portions-those who have the weaker entitlement. Then [the division proceeds to] the group of relatives ʿaṣaba who have the stronger right. [The Prophet] ﷺ said �Whatever remains of the portions goes to the nearest male relative.� Thus is His way sunna forever. Likewise in the words of [God] most high �Then We bequeathed the Book to those of Our servants whom We chose� [35:32] He gave them the Book as the inheritance. Then He showed preference for the wrongdoer over those who take the lead [by beginning with them]. [The wrongdoer] has a weaker claim to put forth for generosity because he is broken-hearted and unable to withstand the prolonged deferral. To the male the equivalent of the portion of two females: If the matter were to be [determined] by analogy qiyās [with the previous examples where the weak are given preference] it would be more appropriate to favor the female because of her weakness and her inability to move about freely. But His determination ������ does not require justification ghayr al-muʿallal. Your parents and children-you know not which of them is nearer in benefit to you a prescription from God; surely God is ever Knowing Wise. Children benefit you with their service khidma and parents with their compassion raḥma-parents in the state of your weakness at the begin- ning of your life and children in your weakness at the end of your life."
