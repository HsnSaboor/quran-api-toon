tafsir[6]{c,v,t}:
  2,239,"And if you are in fear then standing or mounted. But when you are secure then remember God as He taught you what you knew not. That is �Do not abandon intimate conversations with Me at their [desig- nated] times in the way I have made possible for you for truly I am the One who gives power over you to the enemies you fear. But when you withdraw in your hearts through Me their hands will be unable to reach you since I have appointed victory for you over them. Then when the fear is gone from you and you are secure return to what you have established [in prayers] and exert your utmost in the times of your devotion in My presence in private or in public.�"
  2,240,"And those of you who die leaving wives make testament for their wives provision for a year; but if they go forth you would not be at fault regarding what they may do with themselves honorably; God is Mighty Wise. The waiting period after the death of the husband in the beginning of Islam was an uninterrupted year according to the words and actions of the Arabs. With respect to that the one who spoke for them said: Until the end of the year then �peace be upon both of you.� Whoever weeps for an entire year has absolved themselves of any guilt. Then this was abrogated [and made] four months and ten days since the mourning period inevitably ends. The one who spoke for them said: He said �If you die I cannot live.� I said �You are being hypocritical so be silent. What living thing do you see that dies from love for something which is deadḍ�"
  2,241,"There shall be provision for divorced women honorably-an obliga- tion on those who fear. The allusion is that you [men ]should not combine separation with depriva- tion thereby doubling the difficulty for them [women]."
  2,242,"So God makes clear His signs for you so that you might understand. �[These are] guideposts dalāÌil so learn refined behavior through what has been pointed out to you-you will prosper by that which you come to understand from the allusions ishārāt of My decree.�"
  2,243,"Have you not seen those thousands who went forth from their habi- tations fearful of deathḍ God said to them �Die!� Then He gave them life. Truly God is bounteous [dhū faḌl] to people but most people are not thankful. When [the children of Israel] deemed God's power to restore [them] unlikely He showed [His power] to them directly in their own selves. The outward disclosure of that however did not benefit those who had not sharpened their insight regarding divine unity tawḥīd. Anyone whose insight has been strengthened will not be harmed by a lack of these direct forms of evidence for they have already realized through their faith in the unseen the truth of what they have been told."
  2,244,"So fight in God's way and know that God is Hearing Knowing. This means �If pain touches you and a cry rises up from you know that God hears your cry knows your states and sees your affairs.� The verse brings about an easing of the pain they endure. They said: While most people want ease and comfort I wish to complain to you for then you will hear."
