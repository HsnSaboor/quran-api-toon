tafsir[4]{c,v,t}:
  3,154,"When you were ascending not turning around for anyone and the Messenger was calling you from your rear so he rewarded you with grief for grief so that you might not grieve for what escaped you neither for what befell you; and God is aware of what you do. Then He sent down upon you after grief security-a slumber overcom- ing a party of you and a party whose own souls distressed them thinking wrongly of God thoughts of the age of ignorance saying �Have we any part whatever in the affairḍ� Say: �The affair belongs entirely to God.� They conceal within their hearts what they do not disclose to you saying �Had we had any part in the affair we would not have been slain here.� Say: �Even if you had been in your houses those for whom it had been appointed that they be slain would have sallied forth to the places where they were to lie� that God might try what was in your breasts and that He might prove what was in your hearts; and God knows what is in the breasts. The verse alludes to people for whom a period of slackening fatra occurs. The calls of the Real ������ come from within and without so that it is as if the rocks in the streets and the bricks in the walls were crying out to such a one �do not do it O servant of God!� But he is resolved upon his crooked way layy and settled in his error ghayy; [he] refuses to acknowledge what he knows would be more fitting and appropriate for his state. If he were to stay with his [original] aim and follow through with his aspiration by all means he would rein himself in and hold himself back from galloping ahead. [But] he gets nothing but gasping breaths anfās mutaṣāʿida and continuous sorrows ḥasarāt mutawātira-the Real ������ has bequeathed him one lonely estrangement after another. Eventually after he has been in this place of distress for a long time the Real ������ will relieve him with His beautiful kindness and draw him near with His gracious affection. He will deliver him from the narrowness of his captivity to the spaciousness of His pardon and favor. Many of these [people] will reach the place of the most respected and thereupon become still by God for God when they have been negated from station and honor and they will stand by God for God without waiting to be brought near and without looking to be welcomed."
  3,155,"Truly those of you who turned away the day the two hosts encountered each other-truly Satan made them slip through some of what they had earned; but God pardoned them; God is Forgiving Forbearing. This verse alludes to the states of those whose spiritual desire irāda has become meager and their intentions niyyāt weak. Their whims hawā control them and listlessness fatra rules them. Face to face with the coun- sel of others the call of desires and the whispers of satans they put their trust in false speech. They have preferred their whims over piety and stayed back. But they do not find happiness in what they have chosen."
  3,156,"O you who believe be not as the disbelievers who say of their brothers when they travel in the land or are on raiding campaigns 'Had they been with us they would not have died and would not have been slain' - so that God may make that anguish in their hearts. For God gives life and He gives death and God sees what you do. Whoever makes a habit of worrying about what is past and planning for his future and each new moment - the least of his punishment will be the constriction of his heart through disconcerting worries and the disappearance of the quality of life from his heart because of his forgetfulness and his saying 'if only such and such' or 'maybe such and such'. The result of this kind of thinking is estrangement and grief the constriction of the heart and separation."
  3,157,"And if you are slain in God's way or die forgiveness from God and mercy are better than what they amass. And if you die or are slain it is to God you shall be mustered. To sacrifice the spirit rūḥ in God is better than life with anything other than God. Returning to God is better for one who knows God than staying behind with anything other than God. Whatever the servant prefers over God is not something that is blessed. If you want there is this world and if you want there is the final outcome. And if you die or are slain it is to God you shall be mustered: When the destination is to God the journey is pleasant-surely when a journey to Him comes to an end its hardships seem sweeter than honey!"
