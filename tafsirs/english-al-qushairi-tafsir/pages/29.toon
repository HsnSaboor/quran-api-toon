tafsir[2]{c,v,t}:
  2,187,"Permitted to you upon the night of the fast is to go in to your wives; they are a vestment for you and you are a vestment for them; God knows that you have been betraying yourselves and so He has turned to you [relent- ing] and He has pardoned you. So now lie with them and seek what God has prescribed for you and eat and drink until the white thread is distinct to you from the black thread at daybreak; then complete the fast to the night; [God] informs us that in truth the customs that characterize human beings are not attributable to Him. Whether you are engaged in worship ʿibāda which is the right of the Real or in the customs of companionship with your mate which is the goal sought by your lower self and worldly con- cern-both are the same for your state so long as there is refined behavior adab. The verse was revealed regarding the lapse of al-Fārūq. [God] made that [lapse] an occasion for a dispensation for all Muslims until the resur- rection. Thus are the rulings of the [divine] solicitude. It is said that [God] knew there is no escaping worldly concerns for the servant so He divided the night and day in this month between His right ḥaqq and your worldly portion ḥaẓẓ. He said �As for My right complete the fast to the night and as for your worldly portion eat and drink until the white thread is distinct to you from the black thread at daybreak.� and do not lie with them while you cleave to the mosques in devotion [to God]. Those are God's bounds; do not approach them. So God makes clear His signs to people so that they might fear. [God] states that the place of nearness is sanctified from the seeking of worldly concerns. He said �When you are occupied with your [lower] selves you are veiled through yourselves in yourselves but when your business is with Us do not turn back from Us to yourselves.� It is said that the jealousy ghayra of the Real ������ [comes] at the times when serious business is mixed with fun. ʿāÌisha [���� ������] said concern- ing it �O Messenger of God I truly love you and love being near to you.� [Muḥammad] replied �Let me be daughter of Abū Bakr I am worshiping my Lord.� He ﷺ said to her �I have a time wherein none but my Lord is allowed me.�"
  2,188,"Consume not your goods between you in deception and proffer them to the judges that you may consume a portion of other people's goods in sin while you are aware. When you turn to created beings to judge matters know that God is watch- ing over you and His knowledge encompasses you. So situate yourself with shyness before the Real ������. Created beings know externals ẓawāhir but the Real ������ ������ is the One who governs the innermost secrets of hearts sarāÌir."
