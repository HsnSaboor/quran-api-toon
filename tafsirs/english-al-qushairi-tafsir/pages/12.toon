tafsir[3]{c,v,t}:
  2,79,"And there are some of them that are illiterate not knowing the scripture but only desires and mere conjectures. So woe to those who write the scripture with their hands then say �This is from God� that they may sell it for a small price. He related that they differed in the shortcomings of their disbelief. One group is the most contemptible while the majority relied on blind fol- lowing taqlīd out of ignorance. It was not that doubt seized them but rather that they were misled by conjecture and speculation. They have no share in their scriptures other than to recite them without knowledge of their meanings. Among this group are those who are mostly concerned with what they desire for themselves. There is no possibility of their being helped and no definitive way of finding the truth among their conjectures. Then He related the bad outcome for them in His words may His men- tion be exalted: So woe to them for what their hands have written and woe to them for their earnings. It means they have lost in the present and in the end. This verse alludes to those who lack sincerity ikhlāṣ in companionship ṣuḥba165 on the path of the Real. They associate with the friends awliyāÌ [of God] externally but they possess no true spiritual desire irāda so they are companions of the heedless with only a partial view of this path Ṭarīqa. Whenever the clamor of worldly fortunes call they rush to respond will- ingly but when the demands of the Real ������ direct them to some endeavor their situation is a bad one since they are not sincere. How intense will be their remorse for what they have hoarded from God! They will not prosper."
  2,80,"And they say �the fire shall not touch us save a number of days.� Say: �Have you taken a covenant with Godḍ God will not fail in His covenant or say you against God what you do not knowḍ This verse alludes to those whose hearts are filled with false claims. Their conjecture has gotten the better of them for out of extreme foolishness they judge themselves to be among the people of the story ahl al-qiṣṣa. Such a person abides yakhlud with the murmurings of his lower desires. He judges the unseen by what he has himself neglected having forgotten the ugliness of what he has done and remembering [only] the errors of his false thinking. He is a servant of his lower self whose good opinion of himself has gotten the better of him. In reality the results of his neglect and deceit possess him. God most high said �And that supposition of yours which you supposed of your Lord has ruined you. So you have become among the losers� [41:23]."
  2,81,"Not so; whoever earns evil and is encompassed by his transgression- those are the inhabitants of the fire therein abiding khālidūn. In the language of scholars168 the one who is encompassed by his trans- gression is the disbeliever. But the allusion in it is to one whose heart has ceased its perpetual calling for help. The possessors of realities are like grain in the frying pan in their moments of wakefulness ṣaḥw. Those [of them] who have become still are thus because of His excessive majesty not because they are listless. Whoever relies on obedience seeks favor from it and thinks that he [can] draw near by means of it but he should keep his distance from this [idea]. Whoever comes to know the truth of God's unity knows that there is no means to Him except through Him."
