tafsir[3]{c,v,t}:
  3,11,"As the way of Pharoah's folk and the people before them who denied Our signs; God seized them for their sins; God is severe in retribution. �They persisted in insolence according to their way sunna and We brought them retribution according to Our way sunna.� They would not stop their persistent [insolence] fa-lā ʿan al-iṣrār aqlaʿū and did not strive to do anything good wa-lā fī l-mabārri Ṭamiʿū. By my life they are those who suffered regret and distress at what they put forward but by that time they found the door blocked wajadū l-bāba masdūdan and their repentance rejected wa-l-nadama ʿalayhim mardūdan."
  3,12,"Say to the disbelievers: �You shall be vanquished and mustered to hell- an evil resting place! He informed them that the speech of the Real will elude them in the future ājil and they will have no delight in living in the present #703;ājil. In the hereafter what they will encounter will be from the severity of the punishment by burning ḥurqa. What [already] afflicts them in this world is absence and separation furqa from God but their faculties of insight have become weak and they do not perceive the pain of [that] punishment."
  3,13,"There has already been a sign for you in two hosts that met; one com- pany fighting in the way of God; and another unbelieving; they saw them twice the like of them; for God confirms with His help whom He will. Surely in that is a lesson for people of vision. When God wants an affair to be accomplished He makes many appear to be few in the eyes of one people and few to appear as many in the eyes of another people. If He covers the inner sight baṣīra of a people the sharpness of their physical eyes abṣār will not benefit them. When He opens the innermost selves of others the obstruction of their faculties of insight baṣāÌir will not harm them."
