tafsir[6]{c,v,t}:
  3,46,"When the angels said �O Mary God gives you good tidings of a word from Him whose name is the Messiah Jesus son of Mary honored shall he be in this world and the hereafter and of those brought close. He shall speak to mankind in the cradle and in his manhood and he is of the righteous.� She was not given good tidings about her portion in this world or her fortunes in the hereafter. Rather she was given good tidings verifying that [she was receiving a] tremendous sign in [the birth of Jesus] and [that] he was a prophet of God-it was a confirmation of the miracle. It is said that He informed her that whoever succumbs to the over- whelming force of the divine power qudra and ends up before His ruling ḥukm will encounter miracles of that power the likes of which no one has experienced. Mary had surely lived for a long time with an excellent reputation and was well-known as a chaste [woman] but then [God] caused confusion about her situation [when she] appeared in a state deemed blame- worthy by people. In actuality it was not as the foolish thought. Their eyes were blocked from seeing the flow of the divine decree jaryān al-taqdīr. It is said that He informed her of what would happen to [her son] step by step and in detail. He told her that he would live in such as way that he shall speak to mankind as a young child and in his manhood and that the deception of [his] enemies would not affect him. It is said in manhood [means] after his descent from the heavens. It is said that He fortified her heart by informing her that while she herself would hold her tongue regarding her innocence [after the birth] God would cause Jesus ���� ������ to speak [as a child] as proof of her sincerity and exalted honor."
  3,47,"She said �Lord how shall I have a child when no mortal has touched meḍ� He said �It is such. God creates what He will. Just as you witnessed the appearance of things contrary to ordinary reality in the provision We gave [to you] likewise We will break with ordinary reality by creating a son without a man having touched [you]. When He decrees a thing that is He desires a ruling ḥukm to come to pass He says to it only: 'Be' and it is. Producing [things] from the beginning and bringing [them] forth are not difficult for Him. When they began to blame her God caused Jesus ���� ������ to speak when he was [only] one day old; [he] said �I have come to you with a sign from your Lord� [3:49]."
  3,49,"And He will teach him the Book wisdom and the Torah and the Gospel. To be a messenger to the children of Israel �I have come to you with a sign from your Lord I will create for you out of clay [something] like the shape of a bird then I will breathe into it and it will be a bird by the leave of God. I will also heal the blind and the leper; and I bring the dead to life by the leave of God. I will inform you too of what things you eat and what you treasure up in your houses. Surely in that is a sign for you if you are believers.� These were His outward signs and dazzling overpowering proofs: bring- ing life to the dead healing the blind and the leper telling [them] what they did secretly and other miracles. [God] stated that [Jesus] confirmed what came before him in laws but was chosen to abrogate part of what came before and to establish another part for them according to the details articulated in the QurÌān."
  3,50,"Likewise confirming that which was before me of the Torah and to make lawful for you some of that which was forbidden to you. I have come to you with a sign from your Lord: so fear God and obey me. Surely God is my Lord and your Lord so worship Him. This is a straight path.� And when Jesus sensed their disbelief he said �Who will be my helpers [in the cause of] Godḍ� The disciples said �We will be helpers of God; we believe in God; witness that we have submitted. When the message reached them and they differed-some of them believed him and some of them called him a liar and they were the majority-he came to know that prophecy does not spare one from affliction and the oppression of enemies. So [Jesus] separated his heart from them and held to his goal qaṣd. He said to his people �Who will be my helpers [in the cause of] God so that they may help me in my exclusive devotion to His true reality and sincere dedication to His goalḍ� Then those who were touched by the effects of [God's] providence āthār al-ʿināya and chosen through the effects of [divine] selection āthār al-takhṣīṣ said �We will be helpers of God; we believe in God; bear witness to us in truth and let nothing come from us that would cast doubt on you.�"
