  2,265,"But the likeness of those who expend their wealth seeking God's good pleasure and to confirm themselves is as the likeness of a garden upon a hill; a torrent smites it and it yields its produce twofold; if no torrent smites it then soft rain [falls upon it] and God sees what you do. Would any of you wish to have a garden of date palms and vines with rivers flowing beneath it for him there is in it all manner of fruit then old age smites him and he has seed but they are weak; then a whirlwind with fire smites it and it is consumed. So God makes clear the signs to you so that you might reflect. These are numerous signs that God mentions by way of striking similitudes for the sincere one and the hypocrite-while the one spends in the way of God the other spends his wealth in vain. While [the sincere] will obtain honor and compensation khalaf for themselves [the hypocrites] will receive only rejection in the present and nothing but ruin talaf in the end. While the effort of these remains worthy of thanks mashkūr those leave behind destruction thubūr and come to a blazing flame. The works of these thrive their wealth grows their states rise high before God and their end will be the communion [of lovers]. The works of those will come to nothing. Their states will be of loss their hopes sealed by misfortune and their curse doubled for them. It is said that the similitude of these is like the one who planted seed; his property thrived and his surplus grew. His branches grew high and his benefit multiplied. The similitude of those is like the one whose bargaining failed; his commodity [was] stolen and his stratagem came to naught in old age. His tribulations continued one after the other in every way and in every time. How can these two be equal as examplesḍ Do they have any resemblance to one anotherḍ"

  2,267,"O you who believe expend of the good things you have earned and of what We have produced for you from the earth and seek not the corrupt of it for your expending; for you would never take it yourselves without closing your eyes to it; and know that God is Independent Laudable. Let everyone consider what he expends on his own account and what is produced by the command of his Lord. That which is brought out against you is from your account book dīwān: That which has been designated for your worldly portion are the precious things you possess and that which has been designated for your Lord are the things of little value from your assets. That which is [given by you] for God's sake is but a morsel while that which is [given by God] for your sake is of the utmost value and [is] the most perfect in blessing. Then see how He forgives you and even accepts it from you. Nay look how He compensates you. Nay look how He praises you for it look how he ascribes it to you. Everything from Him is a favor but He ascribes it to you as an act. Therefore His gift is entrusted to you and the gift is called a reward. He expands you by giving you success from [His] kindness. Then [your expansion] spreads out into the world by [His] beneficence."
