tafsir[6]{c,v,t}:
  2,17,"Their likeness is as the likeness of one who kindled a fire and when it illumined [the area] all about him God took away their light and left them in darkness unable to see The similitude God ������ strikes here for hypocrites is that of someone who kindles a fire in the beginning of the night then the fire is extinguished and he is left in the darkness. Similarly something of the benefits of this world appear to the hypocrites outwardly but then they are afflicted in the hereafter by the pain of the punishment. Or [it may be that] something of their affirmation iqrār flashes but then they remain in the darkness of their denial inkār. The allusion in this verse is to one who has a beautiful beginning trav- eling the path of spiritual desire Ṭarīq al-irāda. He toils for a time and endures one difficulty after another. He then returns to this world before having reached the truth and reverts to the darknesses of human nature within him. His stem sprouted but did not bear fruit. His branch blossomed but did not ripen. He hastened the eclipse of listlessness over the moons of His presence. The hand of subjugation rejected him after the tongue of kindness beckoned him. His heart moved away from closeness and his lower self became full of rancor toward the seekers. He is as it is said: When passion settled in and we said we were happy we thought we were secure from growing apart. Division sent its messengers in secret and destroyed what we had brought together in our union. The allusion in this verse also pertains to one who grasps [only] the lowest level of comprehension but makes claims far above what he [knows]. When the ongoing increase he possesses in his states is cut off he remains in the darkness of his claims. There is also [an allusion to] the one who relies on the rubble and glitter of this world. When [his] states become like a well-trodden road helped along by hope and rising expectation death appears as an ambush of the divine ruse. He leaves everything yatruk al-kull but carries the burden forth yaḥmil al-kall."
  2,18,"deaf dumb blind they shall not return Deaf to hearing the calls of the Real with the ears of their hearts dumb to whispered conversation with the Real with the tongue of their innermost selves blind to witnessing the flow of decreed events with the eyes of their faculties of insight. They shall not return from their persistent shamelessness nor can they be deterred from their wholehearted embrace of errors. It is said deaf to hearing through the Real dumb to speaking through the Real blind to studying creation through the Real. There was no predetermination for them to desist iqlāʿ and no allotment to help them in being deterred irtidāʿ."
  2,19,"Or as a cloudburst out of the heaven in which is darkness and thunder and lightning-they put their fingers in their ears against the thunderclaps cautious of death; and God encompasses the disbelievers. The meaning of His saying �Or� is that He gives either one of these two similitudes for [the hypocrites]. He compares the QurÌān to rain descend- ing from the heaven and compares the promises and threats in the QurÌān to the thunder and lightning in the rain. He compares their seeking refuge to [the ways they] flee from hearing the QurÌān distance themselves from attentiveness and neglect to try to gain insight to those who put their fingers in their ears against hearing the sounds of thunder. Similarly the allusion is to the heedless when the admonitions of those who admonish reach their ears or the lights of felicity shine on their hearts. If they would desist from their blind heedlessness they would be happy. But they keep each other distracted by false hopes and have resolved upon their corrupt path. They make weak excuses and swear by God �Had we been able we would have gone forth with you� destroying their souls [9:42] and they bring about their destruction by their own hands. Truly when the noble one gives you his love he veils the ugly and brings the beautiful to light. Similarly when the one who is tired wants to break things off he becomes weary of being together and says �That was that.�"
  2,20,"The lightning well-nigh snatches away their sight; whensoever it gives them light they walk in it; and when the darkness is over them; they stop; had God willed He would have taken away their hearing and sight; Truly God has power over all things. Part of the similitude of the hypocrites-as also the heedless-is that when they are present at public sermons or their hearts incline to gentleness or some terror overwhelms them their states move closer to repentance and their longing to turn [to God] becomes stronger. But when they revert to their own planning and seek counsel from those close to them their fam- ily and offspring urge them to return to their world. They offer their advice frightening them with weakness and dependency so that their resolve becomes weak their spiritual desire irāda declines and they become as it is said: Whenever he repents he returns to his ignorance just as the one who is feeble suffers a relapse. He said �had God willed He would have taken away their hearing and sight� meaning the outward hearing and seeing of the hypocrites as well as their being deaf and blind inwardly. The same [is true] for the heedless and those who are content with the external aspects of Islam-God most high has the power to negate the positive outcome tawfīq of their practice of outward acts of obedience ẓāhir al-Ṭāʿāt just as He has the power to negate the realization taḥqīq of what they have discovered from the most felicitous states ṣafāÌ al-ḥālāt."
  2,21,"O people worship your Lord who created you and those that were before you so that you may be fearful. Worship ʿibāda is becoming harmonious muwāfaqa with the command and it is pouring all energy into requests for realization taḥqīq of the unseen. The declaration of oneness tawḥīd enters one through the heart disengagement tajrīd [enters] through the innermost self becoming single-minded tafrīd [comes] through intention qaṣd and humility [comes] through the self. Surrender istislām is to the decree ḥukm. It is said �worship Him� by renouncing prohibited things persevering in performing acts of obedience welcoming obligatory acts with humility and lowliness and avoiding detours through the waystations of laziness and indifference. His saying �so that you may be fearful� is to bring the command closer to them and to make it easier. By the word �may� He keeps them at the bounds of fear and hope. The real meaning of �fear of God� taqwā is protecting oneself through conformity [to God's command] from the threats of punishment."
  2,24,"And if you are in doubt concerning what We have revealed to Our servant then bring a sūra like it; and call your witnesses besides God if you are truthful. And if you do not and you will not then fear the fire whose fuel is men and stones prepared for disbelievers. He covered the eyes of outsiders so that they did not see His beloved ﷺ and they wandered in the wadis of conjecture because they had lost the light of solicitude. When the Messenger brought signs to them and made miracles appear it only increased their doubts and suspicions. This is the way of those who have turned away from the Real ������. The illumination of proofs only increases their blindness to the truth. God most high said But signs and warners do not avail a folk who will not believe [10:101]. In order to bring them to admit the proof He informed them of their inabil- ity to compete with the miracle He gave them in the QurÌān [a miracle] which was triumphant over humankind from the first to the last. He made them acknowledge that even if they were to make common cause among themselves and strengthen themselves with others like them and exert their utmost efforts and stratagems they would not be able to bring a sūra like any sūra of the QurÌān. He said �If you do not� and then stated that they could not and would not do it for He said �and you will not.� It is as if He said �Look to yourselves and be wary of the idolatry that leads to the punishment of the fire whose fuel is men and stones.� If stones with all their hardness cannot withstand this fire how can men with their weakness bear itḍ When the hearts of the believers became terribly concerned from hearing mention of the fire He strengthened them and said �prepared for disbelievers.� In that is good news for the believers. This is the way of the Real ������. When He causes fear in His enemies he brings glad tidings to His friends. Just as the deception of the disbelievers vanishes when it encounters the miracles of the prophets ḍ similarly the claims of the confused disappear when the lights of the truthful appear. The mark of the one who makes false claims is the return of driving cries rujūʿ al-zajr to the heart. The mark of the one with truthful intent is the occurrence of the [divine] subjuga- tion wuqūʿ al-qahr of the heart. It is a rare individual who can separate and distinguish between [these two types of occurrences in the heart]."
