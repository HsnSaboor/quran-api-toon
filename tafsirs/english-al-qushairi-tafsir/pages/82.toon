tafsir[3]{c,v,t}:
  4,24,"And wedded women save what your right hands own this is what God has prescribed for you. Lawful for you beyond all that is that you seek using your wealth in wedlock and not illicitly. Such wives as you enjoy thereby give them their wages as an obligation; you are not at fault in agreeing together after the obligation. God is ever Knowing Wise. When you stay mindful of the limits ḥudūd respect agreements ʿuhūd and obtain mutual consent with women33 according to the law there will be no enmity in it for people and no punishment to follow from it from the Real ������ for that is lawful and without further restriction."
  4,25,"And whoever has not the means wherewith to be able to marry believing women in wedlock let him take believing maids whom your right hands own. God knows very well your faith; the one of you is as the other. So marry them with the permission of their folk and give them their wages honorably as women in wedlock not illicitly or taking lovers. But when they are given in wedlock if they commit lewdness they shall be liable to half the chastisement of married women. That is for those of you who fear the distress of sin yet it is better for you to be patient. God is Forgiving Merciful. Concessions have been granted for the weak. As for the strong He bids them to serious endeavor and the adoption of what is most comprehen- sive and restrictive in the law since there is no work for them except to uphold the right of the Real ḥaqq al-ḥaqq. When an external matter distracts them from their attention to the heart so that they adopt what is easier and less this takes them farther away from their attention to the innermost self for it is an abandonment of the most important and sublime matters. Whoever descends in degree from adopting that which is strongest and most comprehensive-[this decline] to what is permissible for him [is actually] a decline into the state of indulgence. Then He said at the end of the verse yet it is better for you to be patient. This means [patient] in enduring what is difficult in [your situation]. This is a soothing way [of speaking] to the servant since He did not say �Be patient� but rather yet it is better for you to be patient."
  4,26,"God desires to make clear to you and to guide you in the ways of those before you and to turn [in forgiveness] toward you; God is Knowing Wise. When He told the Prophet ﷺ and his community the stories of those from past communities and what they did and how they were dealt with they looked to what would be done with them since there were among them those who also did the impermissible. So they said �If only we knew in what way [God] will deal with us. Will it be abasement metamorphosis35 punishment or whatḍ� So God most high said and to guide you in the ways of those before you We will inform you of that which we did with them and to turn [in forgiveness] toward you. As for you I turn [in forgiveness] to you and as for those who came before you I have already destroyed them utterly. It is said that God desires to make clear to you by unveiling His secrets to you so that what was hidden from others will be made manifest to you. It is said that God desires to make clear to you His singularity in bring- ing things into existence and originating new things-no one else has any part in this. And to guide you in the ways of those before you: the path of the prophets and the friends. This [guidance] is entrusting [everything to God] being content and surrendering completely to the [divine] decree and judgment. It is said: And to turn [in forgiveness] toward you that is He accepts your repentance after having created it and then repays you according to what He has created for you in your repentance."
