tafsir[6]{c,v,t}:
  4,115,"But whoever makes a breach with the Messenger after guidance has become clear to him and follows other than the way of the believers We shall turn him over to what he has turned to and We shall expose him in hell-an evil journey's end. Thoughts khawāṬir that come from the Real are His emissaries to the servant. Whoever opposes the subtle directives ishārāt that are demanded by the inner path brings upon himself the punishments of hearts. Included among these is the blinding of his eyes to the perception of what is right rushd. Just as someone who resists consensus ijmāʿ in the [outer] religion leaves the fold so someone who resists what he recognizes as the truth after the path has become clear to him falls away."
  4,116,"God does not forgive that anything should be associated with Him; He forgives all except that to whomever He will. Whoever associates anything with God verily he has strayed far away. What they pray to instead of Him are but females and they only pray to a rebellious satan. God has cursed him. And he said �Assuredly I will take to myself an appointed portion of Your servants. And I will surely lead them astray and surely I will fill them with desires; and surely I will command them and they will cut up the cattle's ears. And surely I will command them and they will change God's creation.� And whoever takes Satan for a patron instead of God has surely suffered a manifest loss. God does not forgive that anything should be associated with Him: The acknowledgment of anything other than Him imagining even an atom to be a cause of origination is the very essence of associating others with God shirk. There is no possibility of pardon for it while there is a pos- sibility for pardon for other things. Those who seek access to [God] ������ by means of what they imagine are associating others with Him without realizing it. No He is God the One. What they pray to instead of Him are but females: They set up inanimate things with names and plunged forward in their delusion. They relied on the errors of conjecture and therefore strayed far from the truth. And they only pray to a rebellious satan. God has cursed him: that is what they pray to is none other than Iblīs whom the Real has distanced from His mercy and sent away by His distancing. But Iblīs himself is one who is turned about in the grip [of God] according to what the Creator desires. If there was even an atom of [self-sufficiency] that one could affirm in him [that would mean that] there is an associate to divinity in him. Instead it is only the Real ������ who brings about in created beings their states and circumstances aḥwālan and who creates that which follows [satanic] whisperings in being led astray Ḍalālan. For He ������ is the Guide and the One who leads astray and the One who has free disposal over all. [God] most high creates the power of expectations āmālan in [human] hearts after [satanic] whisperings and He makes their ugly actions aʿmālan seem beautiful in their eyes."

  4,120,"He promises them and fills them with desires; but what Satan prom- ises them is only delusion. For such-their abode shall be hell and they shall find no refuge from it. For those whose allotment is being led astray in the present ḥāl He has decreed punishment in the end maÌāl. He makes appear what appears by His deliberative power-how could even a sliver of being astray or being guided belong to anyoneḍ To fully grasp the truth of [God's] oneness tawḥīd is a rare and precious thing-those who have mastered this are few."
