tafsir[8]{c,v,t}:
  4,106,"Surely We have revealed to you the Book with the truth so that you may judge between people by that which God has shown you. And do not be a disputant for traitors. And pray for forgiveness from God; surely God is ever Forgiving Merciful. �We did not command you to judge between them blindly but rather by that which God has shown you that is by that which He unveiled to you from the lights of insight until you understood it by Our teaching you and Our directing you. This is also the case with those from your community who judge with the truth.� And do not be a disputant for traitors: that is do not defend the masters of worldly concerns arbāb al-ḥuẓūẓ but rather be with the children of [God's] rights abnāÌ al-ḥuqūq. Whoever turns to their whim is a trai- tor to the fear of God taqwā entrusted to his soul. Whoever trusts the inclinations of lower desires is a traitor to the shame ḥayāÌ100 required of him before the eyes of the Protector. �And pray for forgiveness from God for your community for surely We suffice for you in Our saying 'that God may forgive you what is past of your sin'� [48:2]."
  4,107,"And do not dispute on behalf of those who betray themselves; surely God loves not one who is treacherous and sinful. They hide themselves from people but they do not hide themselves from God; for He is with them while they plot at night with discourse displeas- ing to Him. God is ever Encompassing of what they do. Those who prefer their worldly concerns ḥuẓūẓ over His rights ḥuqūq and are content to remain in the familiar territories of their whim without moving to the waystations of the [ultimate] contentment riḌāÌ -God does not love those who are treacherous. He will humble them and most assuredly will not honor them. They hide themselves from people: Their hearts are dominated by what created beings can see [or not see]. Those who have been branded with the mark of separation have no awareness that the Real views their hearts from on high."
  4,108,"And do not dispute on behalf of those who betray themselves; surely God loves not one who is treacherous and sinful. They hide themselves from people but they do not hide themselves from God; for He is with them while they plot at night with discourse displeas- ing to Him. God is ever Encompassing of what they do.

  4,109,"Ah! There you are-you have contested on their behalf in the life of this world; but who will contest against God on their behalf on the Day of Resurrection or who will be a guardian for them. That is �We defend them out of respect for you Muḥammad because you are among them but what will their state be on the Day of Resurrection when your blessing O believers will be withdrawn from themḍ�"
  4,110,"Whoever does evil or wrongs himself and then prays for God's forgive- ness he shall find God Forgiving Merciful. �Then� is a particle indicating extended time. That is to say they pass their lives engaged in useless activities and oppositional behaviors and then at the end of their lives pray for God's forgiveness. He shall find God: Finding wujūd is the ultimate event. The disobedient seek only forgiveness but God ������ brings one to the utmost by His grace if He wills. His way sunna is to bring about more than what one hopes for."
  4,111,"And whoever commits a sin commits it against himself only; and God is ever Knower Wise. The Real has no need for the obedience of those who are obedient or the error of the disobedient. So the one who obeys acquires his good for- tune fa-ḥaẓẓuhu ḥaṣṣala and the one who disobeys has abandoned it fa-ḥaẓẓuhu akhalla."
  4,112,"And whoever commits a mistake or a sin and then casts it upon the innocent he has thereby burdened himself with calumny and a manifest sin. Whoever attributes his own disgraceful acts to an innocent person-God turns the tables on him by clothing the innocent one with the robe of the good deeds of his accuser and by pulling the garment of pardon over his bad deeds. And He reverses the situation for the aggressor by exposing his behaviors to his peers."
  4,113,"Were it not for God's bounty to you and His mercy a party of them would have intended to lead you astray; but they lead only themselves astray; they will not hurt you at all. God has revealed to you the Book and wisdom and He has taught you what you did not know; and God's bounty to you is ever great. Bounty faḌl is beneficence iḥsān beyond what is due. �Bounty� alludes to [God's] protection ʿiṣma of [Muḥammad] for the Real ������ protected him with a distinctive protection singled out for him. Just as [God] pro- tected [Muḥammad] from abandoning His right ḥaqq He protected him in averting the deception of His creatures khalq from him saying �Were it not for God's bounty to you and His mercy a party of them would have intended to lead you astray. There is no way that anyone can lead you astray for you are in the grip of the divine power and they lead only themselves astray and they will not hurt you at all for what is guarded maḥfūẓ by Us is secure maḥrūs from everything else. Verily God ������ conferred distinction upon you with the revelation of the Book and made you a special intimate in the ways He preferred and approved of you.� And He has taught you what you did not know. There is nothing like the knowledge He granted to [Muḥammad] alone. It is possible that what He means by this is [Muḥammad's] ﷺ knowledge of God and His majesty and his knowledge of his own servanthood and the worth of his state in strength and beauty. It is said that �He has taught you what you did not know of the propri- eties of service ādāb al-khidma even as a deep knowledge of reality was unambiguous to you.� It is said that �He made you free of the instruction of any others so that none would have a light except what is borrowed from your light. Those who do not walk under your banner will not reach the entirety of Our beneficence nor will they receive the good fortune of nearness and communion with Us.� �And God's bounty to you is ever great in all eternity without end ābād.� You were recognized by Us in the most exalted degree and honorable rank in all eternity without beginning āzāl. It is said that �He has taught you what you did not know concerning the sublimity of your rank over all others.� It is said that �He taught you what you did not know: that one can only value Our measure to the degree108 that one conforms to Our command.�"
