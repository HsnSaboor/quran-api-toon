  3,32,"Say: �Obey God and the Messenger.� But if they turn their backs God loves not the disbelievers. He commanded them to obedience and then He said �But if they turn their backs� that is fall short in obedience by opposing [God's command] then God loves not the disbelievers. He did not say �the disobedient� ʿāṣūn but rather �the disbelievers� kāfirūn so the address indicates that He loves the believers even if they are disobedient."
  3,33,"Lo! God preferred Adam and Noah and the house of Abraham and the house of ʿImrān above the worlds the seed of one another; God is Hearer Knower. Adam and his seed are made of the same substance but the characteristic of being chosen iṣṬifāÌ is something that comes from [God] not through lineage or relation."

  3,35,"When the wife of ʿImrān said �Lord I have vowed to You what is within my womb as a consecration muḥarraran. Accept this from me. Lo! It is You who are the Hearer Knower. [3:36] And when she gave birth to her she said �Lord I have given birth to a female�-and God knew very well what she had given birth to-the male is not as the female. �And I have named her Mary and commend her to You with her seed to protect them from the accursed Satan.� The one who is consecrated muḥarrar is someone who is not in bondage to any created being. The Real ������ in His prior decree has emancipated such a person from the bondage of preoccupation [with anything other than the Real] in all aspects and states. When the mother of Mary made this vow and gave birth to a female she was ashamed. When she saw her she said �Lord I have given birth to a female who cannot be consecrated.� God most high said �and God knew very well what she had given birth to.� By my life the male is not like the female outwardly but when the Real ������ ������ accepted her every miracle appeared from her. When she said �I have vowed to You what is within my womb as a consecration� she added �Accept this from me.� He granted her request and the effects of the acceptance appeared in [Mary] and her son. One set of beings was saved by their story and another was destroyed and expe- rienced a trial fitna because of the two of them. She said �And I have named her Mary and commend her to You with her seed to protect them from the accursed Satan.� She sought protection from God from anything in her words that [might] belong to Satan."

  3,37,"Her Lord accepted the child with gracious acceptance and made her grow excellently and Zachariah took charge of her. He caused [Mary] to attain more than what her mother had wished for. It is said that [God] accepted her with a gracious acceptance qabūl ḥasan by making her unique in obedience to Him and entrusting her with that which He entrusts His friends awliyāÌ-so much so that every person of her time was astonished by the excellence ḥusn of that which He had entrusted to her even though she was a girl. It is said that the gracious acceptance was the excellence ḥusn of [God's] care for her in spite of His ������ knowing what would be said about Him because of her for He is not concerned with the shamefulness of the words of enemies. I find blame in passion for you sweet. Out of love of hearing you mentioned let them blame me. Just as it is said: Let anyone who wishes say what he wishes. I do not care! It is also said that the gracious acceptance was His causing her to grow preserved [from sin and error] ʿiṣma until she said: Lo! I seek refuge in the Compassionate One from you! If you fear God [19:18]. And made her grow excellently until she stood straight in obedience and preferred His ������ good pleasure in every moment and until the fruit from her was such a person as Jesus ���� ������. This was the excellent growth. Zachariah took charge of her and it was part of [God's] gracious acceptance and [His granting her] excellent growth that He made one such as Zachariah ���� ������ among the prophets her guardian and the caretaker and protector of her affairs. God revealed to David ���� ������ �If you see someone seeking me become a servant to him in raÌayta lī Ṭāliban fa-kun lahu khādiman.� Whenever Zachariah went into the sanctuary where she was he found her with provisions. �O Mary� he said�Whence comes this to youḍ� She said �From God. Truly God provides for whomever He will without reckoning.� Among the signs of [God's] gracious acceptance was that she could never be found anywhere except in the sanctuary miḥrāb. Whoever dwells and stays where He is worshiped where the sanctuary is-that is a rare and precious servant."
