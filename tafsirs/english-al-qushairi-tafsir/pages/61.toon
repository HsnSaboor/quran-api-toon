tafsir[7]{c,v,t}:
  3,84,"Say: �We believe in God and that which has been revealed to us and that which has been revealed to Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and the tribes; and in that which was given to Moses and Jesus and the prophets from their Lord; we make no division between any of them; and to Him we submit.� We believe in God not our lower selves nor our strength or our power. We believe through God in that which has been revealed to us and through God ������ we make no division between any of them-not through our own strength choice effort or acquisition. If He had not taught us who He is we would never have known-for otherwise how could we have learned thisḍ"
  3,86,"How shall God guide a people who have disbelieved after their belief and bore witness that the Messenger is true and after the clear signs had come to themḍ God guides not the evildoing folk. Those whom He made unsuitable for the communion [of lovers] in His prior decree-how shall He draw them near to Him on the carpet of service through His favor nowḍ It is said [with regard to] those whom He made far removed in the pre- eternal decree-when would He bring them nearer to sincerity in [their] actionsḍ God prevails over His affair."
  3,87,"Those-their requital is that there shall rest on them the curse of God and of the angels and of men altogether. Those-their state in the end is the same as it was from His decree in the beginning of their affair. The beginning for them is fate's rejection radd al-qisma [of them] their middle part is being turned away from service al-ṣaddu ʿan al-khidma and then finally [their] outcome is banishment and abasement al-Ṭard wa-l-madhalla."
  3,88,"Abiding therein the chastisement shall not be lightened for them and they shall not be reprieved. Abiding in that abasement [their] punishment will not abate for even a moment lā yaftur ʿanhum al-ʿadhāb laḥẓatan nor will the separation be lightened for them for even an hour lā yukhaffafu dūnihim al-firāq sāʿatan."
  3,89,"But those who repent thereafter and make amends then truly God is Forgiving Merciful. [Those who repent] are those whom mercy reaches. They were not among the group [distanced by the prior decree] although people imagined them to be part of it."
  3,90,"Surely those who disbelieve after they have believed and then increase in unbelief their repentance shall not be accepted; those are the ones who go astray. This alludes to those who return to the states of the people of habit ahl al-ʿāda after having traveled the path of spiritual desire Ṭarīq al-irāda. They prefer this world and to submit to their whims over seeking the Real ������ ������. Then they renounce the people of the path ahl al-Ṭarīqa and become ever more alone in their [inner] darknesses. Their repentance shall not be accepted; those are the ones who go astray from the path of the Real for trust amāna cannot be regained once treachery khiyāna has been displayed. As the days pass their punishment is the increasing estrange- ment of [their] hearts from the path and they are not distressed by the felicitous state that has slipped away from them. If they had persevered their repentance would have been accepted but the Real ������ follows His way sunna with those who are listless on this path when they revert to habitual states aḥwāl al-ʿāda and do not feel regret for the moments that have passed away from them. God most high said �And We shall confound their hearts and eyes; just as they did not believe in it the first time� [6:110]. The apostate from Islam is a more powerful enemy to Muslims than the original disbeliever. Likewise the one who reverts from this path is more powerful in rejecting it and more oppositional to its people than those who were always alien to it."
  3,91,"Surely those who disbelieve and die disbelieving the whole earth full of gold shall not be accepted from any one of them if he would ransom himself thereby; for them awaits a painful chastisement and they shall have no helpers. This alludes to the one who dies after becoming listless. Even if he had a beautiful beginning he will not be gathered in the hereafter with the people of this story ahl hādhi al-qiṣṣa even if a thousand of those with deeper knowledge were to intercede for him. Indeed the perfection of the ruse with him is that his image will be cast onto someone else in the hereafter so that his acquaintances among the people of deeper knowledge ahl al-maʿrifa will think that it is him but it will not occur to anyone that he should intercede for him."
