tafsir[8]{c,v,t}:
  3,62,"This is the true story. There is no god but God and assuredly God is Mighty Wise. This is the true story: The dust of confusion has no authority over the wit- nessings of divine unity. No delusion of any created being reaches the secret of His ruling ḥukm. Nothing that is known in existence can come close to it and nothing that is imagined can conceive of the divine decree taqdīr."
  3,63,"And if they turn their backs God knows the agents of corruption. �And if they turn their backs O Muḥammad the confusion of those who talk falsely cannot withstand the rays of your light.� God knows the agents of corruption: either He will sweep them away or He will forbear until their conjectures have become firmly established. Then He will seize them suddenly and [then] they cannot be helped."
  3,65,"�O people of the scripture Why do you argue about Abrahamḍ when the Torah was not revealed neither the Gospel but after him. What do you not comprehendḍ He put a cloak niqāb of possessiveness and a veil ḥijāb of jealousy over His friend ���� ������ and severed his connection to all of them after their accusation about him and [thus he] decisively contradicted their confused arguments. How could Abraham ���� ������ belong to the religion of those who came after himḍ This makes no sense."
  3,66,"Lo! You are those who dispute about what you know; why do you then dispute concerning that of which you have no knowledgeḍ; and God knows and you know not. That is �Your scripture includes clear evidence bayān that should be a proof burhān for you. Regarding that [evidence or proof] you have chosen either truly or falsely. As for that for which you have no defini- tive evidence dalīl or any way of knowing maʿrifa how can you begin to judge it or make claims to have comprehended itḍ�"
  3,67,"No; Abraham in truth was not a Jew neither a Christian but he was a Muslim and a ḥanīf The ḥanīf is one who stands straight mustaqīm in truth while the aḥnaf stands straight mustaqīm with curved legs-one who leans on a [twisted] foot is called mustaqīm optimistically. Abraham ���� ������ was a ḥanīf not bend- ing from the truth not swerving from the law and not stumbling this way and that with every promise of personal gain. He surrendered his wealth his self his son-everything altogether-to the decree of God and [stood in] a state of readiness for His command. and he was never of the idolators."
  3,68,"Surely the people with the best claim Abraham are those who followed him and this Prophet and those who believe; and God is the Protector of the believers. Whereas whims ahwāÌ and blameworthy innovations bidaʿ break up [a group] so that each faction ends up in error the people of truth ahl al-ḥaqq in every era and every time and moment hold to the best proof and will be a single party. They will be those with the best claim [to Abraham] over others. Abraham was a companion of truth ṣāḥib al-ḥaqq.  Whoever professes his religion dīn-as in the example of our Messenger ﷺ and his community-belongs to the religion of Abraham ���� ������ which is the declara- tion of the unity tawḥīd of God ������ ������. And God is the Protector walī of the believers because they have been entrusted108 with His religion dīn and they act in harmony with the declaration of His unity tawḥīd. The protecting friendship walāya of God comes with aid ʿawn help nuṣra selection takhṣīṣ and nearness qurba."
  3,69,"There is a party of the people of the scripture who yearn to make you go astray; yet they cause none to stray except themselves; but they are not aware. Those who had succumbed to discord who had been afflicted by tribulation and seduced by temptation wished for all people what had befallen them. Although [this party of] the people of the scripture wanted the believers to turn from the truth God refused to do other than perfect His light and sent back upon them the evil consequences of their actions."
  3,70,"O people of the scripture! Why do you disbelieve in God's verses when you yourselves bear witnessḍ �[You bore witness] before his mission ﷺ to the authenticity of his prophecy. What is it that brings you to error so that you disavow what you knowḍ�"
