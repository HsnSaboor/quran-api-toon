tafsir[4]{c,v,t}:
  2,58,"And when We said �Enter this city and eat freely therein wherever you will and enter it at the gate prostrating and say �exoneration� and We shall forgive you your transgressions and We shall give more to those who are virtuous.� The children of Israel persisted in neglecting that which they were com- manded to do to the point that they were entrusted to preserve [their] speech but they altered it and they were commanded [to take] a position of prostration upon entering [the city] but they did not. They exposed themselves to the arrows of the unseen and then were not able to with- stand the injury of their strikes lam yuṬīqū l-iṣābata bi-qarʿihā. They were exposed to unexpected punishments and could not hold up to the blows of their impact fa-lam yathbutū ʿinda ṣadamāt waqʿihā."
  2,59,"Then the evildoers substituted a saying other than that which had been said to them; so We sent down upon the evildoers wrath from the heaven for their wickedness. They could neither ward off the opening of heaven above them with their stratagems nor avert the cords of affliction below them by relying on their usual states. They gnashed the teeth of remorse when the fangs of pain bit them. How could this have benefited them when the situation was hopelessḍ"
  2,60,"And when Moses sought water for his people We said �Strike the rock with your staff� and there exploded from it twelve fountains and each people came to know their drinking place �Eat and drink of that which God has provided and do not be degenerate in the earth seeking corruption.� One who is capable of extracting water from solid rock is capable of quenching thirst without water. But He made the trace or effect athar of the miracle manifest in [Moses] and connected him to the locus maḥall of calling for help. This in order for Moses to work with his self nafs in mov- ing the stone and give him responsibility in striking it with his staff. Thus there would be a measure of [human] effort involved in making His decree come to pass when he sought water for his people. Then the Real ������ wanted each people to follow a way sunna stick to their boundary ḥadd and not dispute with their companions. He singled out for each tribe a marker by which they would know their drinking place so that they would not go to each others' drinking places. When He had met their needs He bid them to be grateful to preserve the command and to stop choosing sin and so He said �and do not be degenerate in the earth seeking corruption.� The drinking places are different and each comes to their own so one drinking place is sweet and fresh another salty and bitter another clear and pure and another dried up with only a few drops. The water carrier for each people leads them and the scout of each party drives them on so the lower selves come to the watering places of desires and cravings the hearts come to the drinking places of piety and acts of obedience the spirits come to the watering places of unveiling and witnessing and the innermost selves come to the watering places of realities. The latter [innermost selves] are snatched from the being and outward markings al-kawn wa-l-marsūmāt [of humans] then from the sensory awareness and attributes al-iḥsās wa-l-ṣifāt [of humans] then annihilated in the reality of ecstatic finding and essence al-wujūd wa-l-dhāt."
  2,61,"And when you said �Moses we will not endure one sort of food; pray to your Lord for us that He may bring forth for us of what the earth pro- duces-green herbs cucumbers garlic lentils onions�; He said �Would you exchange what is better with what is lowlierḍ� �Go down to a city you shall have what you demanded�; And abasement and wretchedness were cast upon them and they incurred God's wrath; that was because they used to disbe- lieve the signs of God and slay prophets without right; that was because they disobeyed and they were transgressors. They were not content with the goodness of [God] choosing for them nor were they patient in His managing what He desired for them in basic food and clothing. In their confusion they fell back to their customary behavior of eating impure food and finding contentment in a lower state so He returned them to the suffering of ignominy muqāsāt al-hawān and bound them to perpetual disappointment idāmat al-khidhlān. They went so far as to shed the blood of prophets and violated the sanctity of [God's] command with their lack of shame. They did not repent so He punished them for their ugly acts qabīḥ fiʿālihim and returned them to what He had chosen for their souls in their contemptible states khasāÌis aḥwālihim. When sincere counsel naṣīḥa did not succeed with them retribution and humiliation faḌīḥa overtook them. It is said that the children of Israel were divided in their aspirations and scattered in their objectives. They were not content to have just one food for themselves nor were they satisfied with one object of worship in their religion; [this was true] to the point that they said to Moses ���� ������ when they saw people worshiping idols �O Moses make for us a god just as they have gods� [7:138]. This is the attribute of the masters of separation arbāb al-tafriqa. Patience with the One al-wāḥid is hard. God most high said �And when you mention the Lord alone waḥdahu in the QurÌān they turn their backs in aversion� [17:46]."
