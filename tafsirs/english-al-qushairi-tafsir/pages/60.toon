tafsir[4]{c,v,t}:
  3,78,"And there is a group of them who twist their tongues with the Book so that you may suppose it as part of the Book; yet it is not part of the Book; and they say �It is from God� yet it is not from God and they speak falsehood against God while they know. This verse alludes to those who are false in their claims on this path Ṭarīqa. They embellish what they say and let loose their tongues concerning what their hearts have no information or verification about. In this they deceive the foolish ordinary people and novices. They imagine that they have attained realization of what they say. In describing them God most high said so that you might suppose it is as part of the Book; yet it is not part of the Book. In a similar manner the lords of deception and fraud direct their talk to the weak so that the secrets of the people of realities ahl al-ḥaqāÌiq are exposed before them. God most high said and they speak falsehood against God while they know that is they know that they are speaking falsely. Thus the people of falsehood and deception on this way Ṭarīqa speak from hearts qulūb that are ruined and innermost selves asrār that are veiled. We seek refuge in God from deserving wrath."
  3,80,"He would never order you to take the angels and the prophets as lords. Would He order you to disbelieve after you have submittedḍ That is �do not attribute to them so much as an atom in the establishment of good and evil ithbāt al-khayr wa-l-sharr.� It is said that He is informing you of the boundary of human nature ḥadd al-bashariyya and the truth of lordship ḥaqq al-rubūbiyya. It is said that He orders you to respect tawqīr them with regard to the command and the law sharīʿa but to disdain taḥqīr the worth of cre- ated things in comparison to lordship rubūbiyya. Would He order you to disbelieve after you have submittedḍ �Would He order you to affirm ithbāt created things after bearing witness shuhūd to the Realḍ� It is said: �Would He order you to look to outward appearances ashkāl and to attribute events to simulacra amthāl after the lights of unity tawḥīd have appeared in your innermost selves and after the suns of singular devotion tafrīd have arisen in your heartsḍ�"
  3,82,"Then whoever turns his back after that they are the wicked. This alludes to whoever abandons [the Prophet's] way sunna or wan- ders [away] from following his path Ṭarīqa after the appearance of [the Prophet's] evidence and the clarity of his miracle. They are those whose condition has become corrupted. They have become deserving of wrath because of their denial and the breaking of their attachment to the divine solicitude."
  3,83,"What! Do they desire other than God's religion when to Him has sub- mitted whoever is in the heavens and the earth willing or unwillingly and to Him they shall be returnedḍ Anyone who pays attention to what is not real ghayr al-ḥaqīqa or looks to what is other than Him in imagining divinity ilāhiyya is like one who sees a mirage he thinks is water māÌ but when he comes to it he finds only dust habāÌ. The errors of mere suppositions cut one off and confuse; those who descend into them have entered a desolate wadi. To Him has submitted whoever is in the heavens and the earth willingly because of the lights of divine self-disclosure coming down continually to their innermost selves or unwillingly because of the flow of the divine decree overpowering them."
