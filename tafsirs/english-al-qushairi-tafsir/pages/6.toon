tafsir[3]{c,v,t}:
  2,31,"And He taught Adam the names all of them; then He presented them to the angels and said �Now tell Me the names of these if you speak truly.� The general expression ʿumūm in His saying names necessarily implies comprehensiveness while the connection of this word to all of them indicates all-inclusiveness and verification [of the meaning of each]. Just as He taught [Adam] the names of created things-all of them according to what is articulated in the tafsīr of Ibn ʿAbbās and others-He also taught him the names of the Real ������. But He only disclosed to [the angels] the locus He chose for knowledge of the names of created things and by that [disclosure] the measure of [Adam's] superiority over them. As for [Adam's] uniqueness in knowing His names ������ that was a secret of which no angel who is near malak muqarrab was aware. One who does not have a rank equal to Adam in knowing the names of created things-what hope could there be in his approaching the names of the Real and grasping the secrets of the unseenḍ Since being selected to know the names of created things makes it proper for the angels to prostrate before him what is one to think about being selected to know the names of the Real ������ḍ What is owed to one who is honored with thatḍ It is said that the special status of the angels is in [their] glorification and sanctification [of God]. These acts of obedience are appropriate for created beings for surely obedience is the mark of servants and servants alone. [On the other hand] knowledge in general is a kind of commenda- tion madḥ that is absolutely necessary in describing the Real ������ one that is not appropriate for anything other than Him. Among the category of created beings there is no one more perfect in honoring Him than the one who honors Him through His own explanation of His attributes. It is said that He honored [Adam] privately with what He taught him and then explained His selection of him and His giving him precedence on the day of the public revealing [of Adam to the angels]. It is said [that in the words] then He presented them the [word] �then� thumma is a particle of extension or delay."
  2,32,"They said �Glory be to You! We know not except what You have taught us. Surely You are the Knower Wise.� [The angels] offered praise before they made their apology and declared the truth of His judgment over any objection they might have. It means �We have no knowledge of that which You have asked us about and there is no blame that can be directed to You for charging those who are incapable with something You know they cannot do. Surely You are the Knower Wise that is what You do is true and sincere there is none who can pass judgment over You and there is no foolishness nor ugliness from You.�"
  2,33,"He said �Adam tell them their names�; And when he had told them their names He said �Did I not tell you that I know the unseen in the heav- ens and the earthḍ And I know what you reveal and what you were hiding.� Among the traces of the divine solicitude to Adam ���� ������ is that when He said to the angels Now tell Me [2:31] they were seized with a fear of speaking especially since He asked that they tell Him something that with their type of knowledge [they] did not comprehend. But because of the information Adam ���� ������ had [God] directed him to inform [the angels] saying �tell them their names� and Adam was not overly fearful of speaking to them. When Adam ���� ������ informed them of the names that they did not know [because of the type of knowledge they had] his merit became apparent to them and He said �Did I not tell you that I know the unseen in the heavens and the earthḍ� meaning �[I know] the different types of knowledge of creation which you do not.� �And I know what you reveal regarding [your] acts of obedience and [what you] hide in believing in [your] superiority over Adam ���� ������.� When the Real ������ wanted to choose Adam He protected him taught him and showed him the effects of his care until [Adam] said what he said [about the names]. When He wanted to execute His decree ḥukm regarding him He caused forgetfulness to enter him so that he forgot His covenant in the presence [of God] and transgressed His limit. God most high said And We made a covenant with Adam before but he forgot and We did not find in him any constancy [20:115]. The moment favored by the [divine] solicitude promoted knowledge and goodness completely while the moment in which the [divine] decree took effect returned him to the state of forgetfulness and disobedience. Thus are the decrees of the Real ������ in what they make come and go. The worshiper is made lowly by His decree and He is the doer of what He desires [11:107 85:16]. When they imagined [that they could] obtain preference for themselves by their glorification and sanctification He informed them that the carpet of majesty is too holy to be adorned by the obedience of those who obey or to be defiled by the errors of [those who] stubbornly deny. Their returning to prostration before Adam made manifest [God's] lack of need for the agreement wifāq or opposition khilāf [of created beings]."
