tafsir[4]{c,v,t}:
  4,27,"And God desires to turn [forgivingly] toward you but those who follow their passions desire that you deviate with a terrible deviation. God desires to lighten things for you; for man was created weak. He separates here the story of the former from the story of the latter. Whenever God desires to turn toward someone He will not let an enemy gloat over him and He will not give him anything bad in the two abodes. But those who follow their passions shahawāt desire...: Their desire irāda becomes weak enfeebled and held back before the desire irāda of the Real ������. God desires to lighten things for you. This means [the lightening of] the weight of litanies37 through intermittent incomings wāridāt to your hearts. It is said that God desires to lighten what you endure in struggles mujāhadāt with the lights of witnessings mushāhadāt that enter deeply into your hearts. It is said that God desires to lighten the burdens of service for you with the sweetness of acts of obedience. It is said that He lightens the difficulties of the trust amāna for you by carrying its burden for you. It is said that He lightens the hardships of seeking with the refreshment of arriving. For man was created weak: He describes by this their need and affliction Ḍurr but does not accept40 by this their excuse ʿudhr."
  4,29,"O you who believe consume not your goods between you wrongly except it be trading through mutual agreement. And kill not yourselves. Surely God is ever Merciful to you. And whoever does that through aggression and injustice him We shall certainly expose to a fire; and that for God is an easy matter. Every thing spent for something other than God is capital spent for nothing. It is said that [this refers] to withholding in a heedless way and expend- ing from a place other than that of bearing witness to the true reality ḥaqīqa. All of that comes to nothing. And kill not yourselves that is by committing sins. It is said that it is an indirect reference to those things that would incur His wrath ������. It is said [kill not yourselves] by looking to and paying mind to [your lower selves]. It is said [kill not yourselves] by being pleased with [your lower selves] or giving preference to them over the good pleasure of the Real. And whoever does that through aggression and injustice We will not spare him from a fierce punishment. We will entrust [the fire] with its rightful inhabitant nakilahā ilā ṣāḥibihā and give it free rein wa-nalqā ḥablahā ʿalā ghāribihā."

  4,33,"To each We have appointed heirs of that which parents and kinsmen leave and to those to whom your right hands were pledged. So give them their share. God is ever Witness over everything. In the beginning of Islam He made relationships by mutual commitment the equal of relationships of kin in determining inheritance. While this ruling was later abrogated the rule to respect [one another] remained. If this is the manner of relationships by mutual commitment muʿāqada between men what do you think of the mutual covenant muʿāhada with Godḍ God most high said �men who are true to the covenant they made with God� [33:23]. They have recited: Verily those who have died to the religion of whims find the decree of death a sweet watering place."
