tafsir[3]{c,v,t}:
  4,102,"When you are among them and you stand to lead them in prayer let a party of them stand with you and let them take their weapons. Then when they have performed their prostrations let them be behind you and let another party who have not prayed come and pray with you taking their precautions and their weapons. The disbelievers wish that you should be heedless of your weapons and your baggage that they may descend upon you all at once. You are not at fault if rain bothers you or if you are sick to lay aside your weapons. But take your precautions; God has prepared for the disbelievers a humiliating chastisement. This verse indicates that [the obligation of] prayer is not lifted from the servant so long as there is a breath remaining in him to choose. Not in fear or in security not when you are in a state of separation where the precepts of the law predominate or when overwhelmed by the authority of reality sulṬān al-ḥaqīqa when you are at the source of gathering together ʿayn al-jamʿ."
  4,104,"Be not faint in seeking the enemy; if you are suffering they are also suffering as you are suffering; and you hope from God that for which they cannot hope. God is ever Knower Wise. Stand up for God and let your trust be in God in your struggle jihād. If you are suffering they are also suffering: The enemy shares with you the experience of suffering but they are different from you in the witness- ing of the heart for you witness what they do not witness and you find in your hearts what they do not find. So it is unseemly for you to lag behind them in effort and struggle."
  4,105,"Surely We have revealed to you the Book with the truth so that you may judge between people by that which God has shown you. And do not be a disputant for traitors. And pray for forgiveness from God; surely God is ever Forgiving Merciful. �We did not command you to judge between them blindly but rather by that which God has shown you that is by that which He unveiled to you from the lights of insight until you understood it by Our teaching you and Our directing you. This is also the case with those from your community who judge with the truth.� And do not be a disputant for traitors: that is do not defend the masters of worldly concerns arbāb al-ḥuẓūẓ but rather be with the children of [God's] rights abnāÌ al-ḥuqūq. Whoever turns to their whim is a trai- tor to the fear of God taqwā entrusted to his soul. Whoever trusts the inclinations of lower desires is a traitor to the shame ḥayāÌ100 required of him before the eyes of the Protector. �And pray for forgiveness from God for your community for surely We suffice for you in Our saying 'that God may forgive you what is past of your sin'� [48:2]."
