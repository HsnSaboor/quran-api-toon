tafsir[7]{c,v,t}:
  2,9,"They would deceive God and the believers; and they only deceive them- selves; and they are not aware. The harm of their deception and the punishment for it comes back to themselves so it is as if they have deceived themselves in actuality for they devalue and belittle themselves. No one suffered the harm of their actions but themselves-they cut off their own lifeblood. When there is one who knows the true nature of things the one who desires to deceive him only deceives himself. The allusion in this verse is to the one who has forgotten [God's] prior kindness. He says �mine through me from me and I� slandering in his delusion and conjecture [what should be] �Yours through You from You and You.� This delusion is the most difficult of punishments because he sees a mirage sarāb and thinks it is drink sharāb until he comes to it and finds it to be nothing and he finds God there who pays him his account in full [24:39]."
  2,10,"In their hearts is a sickness; and God has increased their sickness; and there awaits them a painful chastisement because they used to lie. In the hearts of the hypocrites is the sickness of making partners [with God] shirk and God increases their sickness in their imagining that they have been saved by deceiving the Muslims. The pain of their grievous punishment will reach them in the end. The allusion pertains to whoever has confused his ultimate objective qaṣd with his worldly concerns ḥaẓẓ and mixed his spiritual desire irāda with his whims hawā taking one step forward with spiritual desire and one step backward with worldly con- cerns and following the lower self. He is neither a sincere seeker murīd nor permanently neglectful. If the hypocrites had been sincere in their beliefs they would have been safe from the punishment in the hereafter just as they were safe from paying the jizya tax and the like in this world in the manner of polytheists and dhimmīs. Similarly if the seeker murīd had been sincere in his spiritual desire he would have reached out in his heart to the realities of the communion [of lovers] and the blessings of sincerity would have reached him and he [would have] attained what he desired. But his state is as it has been said: We have not been firm but justice will be firm with us without bending. If we had been sincere khalaṣnā we would have been saved takhallaṣnā from tribulation. There is a barrier between one whose worship has become weak and the degrees of the gardens darajāt al-jannāt. There is a barrier between one whose spiritual desire has become weak and the intimate communications of nearness and whispered confidences muwāṣalāt al-qurb wa-l-munājāt. As for those who rely on this world and follow [their] whims their reliance on the abode of illusion is an illness of their hearts. The increase in their disease will increase as their greed increases. The more they find something from [this world] the more their greed multiplies for what they have not found hastening the punishment for them. Among [their] immediate punishments are the dissipation of their aims and then the loss of all pleasure in their lives. They are kept by [these punishments] from their Protector mawlā. There will be no enjoyment for them nor rest in what they have preferred when [they] follow their own whims."
  2,11,"When it is said to them �Do not [foment] corruption in the land� they say �We are only putting things right.� Truly they are the agents of corruption but they perceive not. This alludes to the fact that when thoughts of warning came secretly to their hearts calling them to right conduct they followed self-indulgent interpretations rukhaṣ al-taÌwīl and deceived themselves about that which bore witness to the hardness of their hearts. When they denied the proof of the Real in the thoughts that came to their hearts God took the bless- ing away from their states and in its place gave them a deaf ear to the Real. Their affliction is in their resistance to the path Ṭarīqa and their loss of belief in it. Just as an apostate is a more intense enemy to Muslims so the one who returns from spiritual desire irāda to the world and ordinary customs is the worst of people in rejecting this path and the most distant from its followers. As the proverb goes �Anyone who loses their stored grain to fire wishes the same for others.� According to the sincere among those [on the path] the help of those who have deserted the way of spiritual desire should not be accepted just as the Messenger ﷺ did not accept the almsgiving zakāt of Thaʿlaba. It is said that it is sufficient to expose those who lie by saying to such a person's face �You have lied.� When they said �We are only putting things right� the Real ������ showed them to be liars and He said �Truly they are the agents of corruption but they perceive not� meaning �We are aware of them and have exposed them.�"

  2,14,"When they meet those who believe they say �We believe�; but when they go apart to their devils they say �We are with you; we were only mocking.� God [Himself] mocks them leaving them in their insolence bewildered. The hypocrites wanted to maintain their relations with disbelievers while associating with Muslims so when they appeared before Muslims they said �We are with you� and when they were alone with those like them among the disbelievers they voiced their loyalty to them. They wanted to have relationships with both sides but they were excluded from both. God most high said �Wavering all the time-not to these neither to those� [4:143]. Similarly anyone who wants to combine the path of spiritual desire irāda with [one's habitual behavior] with ordinary people ahl al-ʿāda [should know that] this cannot be done since the two opposites cannot be combined. �The servant who has contracted with his master to be freed is still a servant until the last dirham [is paid].� When night draws nigh day slips away. Anyone who has a hodgepodge khalīṬ in every corner nāḥiyya and a heart bound rabīṬ in every nook zāwiyya is headed for disaster. First one group and then another take turns dwelling in his heart so that it is forever ruined.53 There is no pleasure for him in life nor does he truly possess any provision from his heart. The one who spoke for them said: I see you as someone left over from the people of Moses for they do not wait patiently for food. When the hypocrites said �we were only mocking� God most high said �God [Himself] mocks them� that is He requites them for their mocking. Similarly when people put the reins in the hands of carnal desires they are lured into the wadis of separation. Their feet are not firmly planted in a place so they wander in the labyrinth of absence. Just as he leaves the hypocrites in their insolence bewildered he prolongs the period [in which they dwell with] their confused hopes. So when the times of their deaths draw nigh their hopes are at their highest while their actions are at their lowest. That is the requital for what they did and the noxious result of what they produced. The beautification of their ugly acts in their eyes is the worst of their punishments and their being content with their listlessness is their greatest misfortune."

  2,16,"Those are they who have bought error for guidance; so their commerce has not profited them; nor are they guided. This alludes to those who have neglected what is due ḥuqūq by remain- ing in the familiar territories of worldly fortunes ḥuẓūẓ. [They] have lost their bargain so their commerce has not profited them. Those who are content with this world over the next are in manifest loss. Those who prefer this world or the next over the Real have the most intense loss. Although the one who suffers the loss of [the gardens] of bliss will come up short the one who is afflicted with distance from intimate conversation and the disengagement of his heart from his Protector the one who remains in the captivity of carnal desires with no messenger [reaching] his heart the one without attainment for his spirit without intimate conversation with Him without approach to Him without the witnessing [of Him] in his innermost self-this is the one who [truly] suffers and is afflicted. If even a moment slips away his Lord has slipped away. Moments have no substitutes or alternates. Thus someone said: You were the pupil of my eye. [The organ] by which I see wept for you. Anyone who has a will after you let him die for I used to be a guard over you."
