tafsir[6]{c,v,t}:
  3,23,"Have you not seen those who were given a portion of the Book being called to the Book of God that it might decide between them and then a party of them turned away yatawallā opposedḍ [This means] �We have tested you with calling those whom We already know will not answer. So be patient with what you have been commanded regarding them. Know the misfortune of their states. They are the people who turn away ahl al-tawallī from answering ijāba because they have been deprived of the beauty of divine self-disclosure ḥusn al-tajallī by Our prior will irāda.�"
  3,24,"That because they said �the fire shall not touch us except for a number of days�; and the lies they used to invent have deluded them in their religion. We have punished them in this world drawing them on by degrees bi-l- istidrāj until they [presume to] determine salvation and the lessening of punishment for themselves but they will come to know the doubling of affliction upon them. They think they understand something but they tell a lie. Those in error think that [what they have said] is a determination ḥukm."
  3,25,"But how will it be when We gather them for a day of which there is no doubt and every soul shall be paid in full what it has earned and they shall not be wrongedḍ This address is remarkable because by it He gives information about the imposing grandeur and intensity of the [Day of Gathering] at which point the intellects [of those who turned away] will be perplexed their innermost selves astonished their pretensions cut off their hearts torn from their hidden places and [their souls] will rise to their collar bones. Then there will be what will meet them from the reckoning and censure al-ḥisāb wa-l- ʿitāb the torment and punishment al-ʿadhāb wa-l-ʿiqāb and the lack of honoring and approval ʿadam al-ikrām wa-l-ījāb etc. The resurrection of the disbelievers will take place on the Day of Gathering while the resurrection of the lovers takes place in the present moment; to explain this fully would take a long time."
  3,26,"Say: �O God Allāhumma Master of the kingdom Allāhumma: Its meaning is �O God yā Allāh.� The letter mīm at the end of the word is a substitute for the vocative particle yā. This is a teaching of the Real on how to praise the Real that is �describe Me as I should be described in exalted measure� by saying: �O Master of the kingdom there is no associate to You no assistant no helper no companion no partner to You in essence no sharer in the kingdom no competitor in creating.� you give the kingdom to whom You will and seize the kingdom from whom You will; �... so that we will know that You are the King.� Among created beings the king is he before whom one is humbled and the kingdom that is seized is the kingdom of those who are haughty toward him. [In a similar manner] created beings are beautified tajammul by abasing themselves tadhallul60 before the Real. Their honor and might ʿizz61 is in their effacement maḥw in Him and their remaining baqāÌ is in their annihilation fanāÌ in Him. You exalt tuʿizzu whom You will by the might ʿizz of Your essence. and You abase tudhillu whom You will; by Your forsaking. You exalt whom you will guiding him to witness You and declare Your oneness and You abase whom You will such that he denies You and is deprived of You. You exalt whom you will with the good fortune of Your drawing near and You abase whom You will by the estrangement of Your turning away. You exalt whom You will by bringing him to intimacy with You and You abase whom You will by estranging him from You.  You exalt whom You will by occupying him with You and You abase whom You will by distracting him from You. You exalt whom You will by eliminating the controlling elements of his lower self and You abase whom You will by giving the upper hand to its clamor. You exalt whom You will by the gleams of the rising Ṭawāliʿ of his intimacy [with You] and You abase whom You will by the night visitors Ṭawāriq of his lower self. You exalt whom You will by expanding basṬ him through You and You abase whom You will by constricting qabḌ him from You."
  3,27,"You make the night pass into the day and You make the day to pass into the night; You bring forth the living from the dead and You bring forth the dead from the living You provide whom You will without reckoning. You make the night pass into the day such that the authority of the light of unity tawḥīd prevails and nothing remains of the traces of the lower self and its darknesses. You make the day pass into the night so that it is as if the suns of the hearts were eclipsed or as if the night continued and the morning never came. You bring forth the living from the dead such that it is as if listlessness was no more and the pledge of union returned as a youth and the prom- ises of hearts became young and fresh. You bring forth the dead from the living such that it is as if the tree of discontent sprouted and blossomed thorns and as if the hopeless found nothing good and could not smell [the fragrance] and their hearts and eyes were confounded just as they did not believe in it the first time [6:110]. You provide whom You will without reckoning such that there is no labor kadd no exertion jahd no sweat on the brow jabīn and no toil of the right hand yamīn. His night is refreshment and repose rāḥa and His day is joy and delight bahja. His hours are special gifts karāmāt and His moments are ways of drawing near qurubāt. The different kinds of acts of His favoring cannot be enumerated by the tongue lisān and the inquiry into their full depth cannot be given expression or explanation bayān. But in the glimmers we have given here there is some indication of how to speak of this. It is said that when He said �and seize the kingdom from whom You will� [3:26] anyone who thinks that he is a king [experiences] a rude awakening from [his] drunken intoxication because he now sees [that] his kingdom is vulnerable to extinction and [he] knows that abasing himself to [God] in preserving His kingdom is worthier than vainglorious delusion and pomposity. It is said that the king-in the true sense of the word-is someone who is not distracted by anything from witnessing the One who is the real King."
  3,29,"Say: �Whether you hide what is in your breasts or disclose it God knows it and knows what is in the heavens and what is in the earth; and God is Able to do all things.� There is nothing that escapes His knowledge so do not be grieved by any calamity that afflicts you. Soon He will bring you succor and response and soon the affliction and trial will disappear. He will hasten [His] assistance and protection."
