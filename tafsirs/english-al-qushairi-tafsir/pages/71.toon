tafsir[7]{c,v,t}:
  3,158,"And if you are slain in God's way or die forgiveness from God and mercy are better than what they amass. And if you die or are slain it is to God you shall be mustered. To sacrifice the spirit rūḥ in God is better than life with anything other than God. Returning to God is better for one who knows God than staying behind with anything other than God. Whatever the servant prefers over God is not something that is blessed. If you want there is this world and if you want there is the final outcome. And if you die or are slain it is to God you shall be mustered: When the destination is to God the journey is pleasant-surely when a journey to Him comes to an end its hardships seem sweeter than honey!"
  3,160,"If God helps you then none can overcome you; but if He forsakes you then who is there who can help you after Himḍ Therefore on God let the believers rely. He helps the believers by granting success to the bodily forms bi-l-tawfīqi lil-ashbāḥ and then by granting [spiritual] realization to the spirits thuma bi-l-taḥqīqi lil-arwāḥ. It is said that God helps you by supporting you in your outward cir- cumstances bi-taÌyīdi al-ẓawāhir and by guiding the innermost selves wa-tasdīdi al-sarāÌir. It is said that while [He will] help [you] against the enemy the worst enemy you have is the lower self within you. [His] help against [your] lower self comes when its claims of strength are routed by the guardians of His mercy and the armies of cravings junūd al-shahawāt scatter upon the attacks of the arriving hosts wufūd al-munāzilāt. The protective friend- ship walāya of God will remain purified from the confused clamoring of human qualities and the cravings and desires of the lower selves which are the remaining effects of [what] veils and hinders [people] from nearness. If He forsakes you: The forsaking is the abandonment of those who are disobedient. Those whom He helps He holds back from pursuing what is objectionable and those to whom He gives free rein and leaves to their own bad choices He forsakes. The state [of someone He forsakes] becomes unsettled in the torrents of cravings so he sometimes wanders to the east without shame fa-marratan yusharriqu ghayra muḥtashimin and sometimes to the west without respect wa-tāratan yugharribu ghayra mutaḥrimin. Surely when the Real lets someone go and does not take him by the hand leaving him to himself there is no protector for him. Therefore on God let believers rely in finding security through sincere supplication and laying the robe of pardon over the defects of sin. [This is done] by devoutly seeking refuge and by rejecting any strength or power [other than God]. It is said that when the matter was that of [His] help He said �then none can overcome you.� In the matter of being forsaken He did not say �then there is no helper for you� but rather said more indirectly�then who is there who can help you after Himḍ� Here there is a subtlety regarding the finer properties of the [divine] address."
  3,161,"It is not for a prophet to be fraudulent; whoever defrauds [others] shall bring what he has defrauded on the Day of Resurrection; then every soul shall be paid in full what it has earned and they shall not be wronged. He has made the states of the prophets free of the stain of treacherous actions. �Those to whom We gave the message to bear to Our servants convey it to those who should receive it. They are not concerned with any affair of a close intimate without Our command and they do not hold back harboring malice in passing on anyone's share when We have commanded it.� Do you not see how [the Prophet] said of Abū Ṭālib �Go and bury him� when the Commander of the Believers ʿAlī ��� ���� ��� said to him �Your erring uncle has died�ḍ Do you not see how [Muḥammad] accepted al-Waḥshī the killer of ḥamza when he became a Muslimḍ It is said �It was not for any prophet ﷺ to give Our secrets to any but the people to whom they were meant. Rather to each was revealed what they were meant to hear.� Thus in the tradition �We were commanded to reveal yunzil to the people [what is suitable according to] their stations manāzil.�"
  3,162,"Is he who follows God's beatitude like him who is laden with God's anger whose abode is hellḍ An evil journey's end! They are of degrees before God; and God sees what they do. The one with whom He is well pleased throughout eternity fī azālihi is not equal to the one with whom He is displeased and has abandoned in his states fī aḥwālihi and left him to rely on his own actions ʿalā aʿmālihi oblivious to the witnessing of His favors li-shuhūdi afḌālihi. To seek God's beatitude [one must] separate oneself mufāraqa from what has been prohibited and embrace muʿānaqa what has been commanded. One who divests himself from the prohibited mazjūr and takes heart in embracing what has been commanded maÌmūr has followed God's beatitude riḌwān and has become deserving of the gardens jinān. They are of degrees before God: that is they possess degrees in the decree ḥukm of God-happy are those who have been brought close and wretched are those who have been kept at a distance."

  3,164,"Truly God was gracious to the believers when He sent to them a mes- senger from among their own to recite to them His verses and to purify them and to teach them the Book wisdom though before they were in clear error. [God] gave goodness to them in abundance and favored them with gener- ous blessings for He sent someone like MuṣṬafā the leader of mankind ﷺ to them. [The Prophet] taught them their religion and made their proofs clear to them. He belonged to them in every way but they were not grateful for his blessings did not respect his right and were not able to see what he guided them to nor refrain from straying in error-this is a description of his enemies who denied and were arrogant. As for the believers they were adorned with grace in the [divine] choice ikhtiyār. They received the command to hear and obey to the utmost of their capacity iqtidār so they were happy in this world and the hereafter ʿuqbā and became deserving of generosity and nearness zulfa from God."
  3,165,"And why when distress befell you and you had afflicted twice the like of it did you say �How is thisḍ� Say: �It is from yourselves. Surely God has power over everything.� Human beings usually forget their own error and disobedience ʿiṣyān and turn instead to accuse God of what comes to them in trials loss khusrān and all kinds of unpleasant and difficult things iftitān. It would be better for those who pursue various crimes ṣunūf al-ijrām not to forget the requital to come ḥulūl al-intiqām."
