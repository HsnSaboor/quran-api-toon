tafsir[9]{c,v,t}:
  3,92,"You will not attain piety birr until you expend of what mimmā = min mā you love; and whatever thing you expend God knows of it. When the object of seeking is piety and goodness birr [the preposition] min is used which is [the particle of speech] for dividing something into portions. He said �of what mimmā = min mā you love.� Whoever desires piety and goodness birr should expend some portion of what he loves while whoever desires the One who is All-Goodness al-bārr should expend everything he loves. Whoever expends what he loves in this world will find what he seeks from the Real most high. Whoever is attached to the fortunes of the lower self man kāna marbūṬan bi-ḥuẓūẓi nafsihi will not find fortune in nearness to his Lord lam yaḥaẓẓu bi-qurbi rabbihi. It is said that if you can only attain piety and goodness birr by expend- ing what you love how will you ever reach the One who is All-Goodness al-bārr so long as you prefer your worldly fortunes to Himḍ And whatever thing you expend God knows of it. There are those who expend looking for reward and compensation those who expend looking to defend themselves from affliction and tribulations and those who expend content with His knowing. One of them said: He wishes to walk in a weak way so that she might when she hears of his suffering send a message to him. He trembles because of what has become known in seeking the sublime that his qualities might be mentioned one day before Salmā."
  3,93,"All food was lawful to the children of Israel save what Israel forbade for himself before the Torah was revealed. Say: �Bring the Torah now and recite it if you are truthful.� Whoever invents falsehood against God after that those are the evildoers. [God] does not declare things permissible or prohibited in their original state; in [this state] there is no divine ordinance ḥadd regarding them. That is a liberality and kindness from the Real ������ [and this state exists] until such a [time] as a command or a law comes regarding it. God ������ has eased the precepts of religious obligation aḥkām al-taklīf for advanced disciples ahl al-nihāya. Their way is to adopt what is easiest in order to perfect what comes to them from the precepts of the hearts aḥkām al-qulūb-surely the difficulties made incumbent on their hearts are harder for them. As for novices ahl al-bidāya the affair is made difficult for them with tasks and litanies-their way is to adopt what is more onerous and difficult [in these areas] so as to empty their hearts of thoughts. Whoever thinks otherwise is in error. This verse also alludes in His saying �Whoever invents falsehood against God� to the states of the people of false claims and errors. They absolve themselves and attribute to God ������ their false notions hawājis but God is free of these. It is a rare servant who can distinguish between [true] incoming thoughts khawāṬir and false notions hawājis."

  3,95,"Say: �God has spoken the truth therefore follow the creed of Abraham a ḥanīf and he was not an idolater.� The creed milla of Abraham was complete abandonment to God al-khurūju ilā Allāh bi-l-kulliya and surrender to His decree without hold- ing back in any way wa-l-taslīmu li-ḥukmihi min ghayri an tabqā baqiyya. In truth to affirm ithbāt anything [other than God] in accounting for what comes into being is idolatry shirk."
  3,96,"The first house established for the people was that at Bakka a blessed place and a guidance to all the worlds. Therein are clear signs the station of Abraham; and whoever enters it is secure. It is the duty of people toward God to make the pilgrimage to the House if he is able to make his way there. As for the one who disbelieves God is independent of all the worlds. The House is a bit of stone ḥajara and the servant is a bit of mud madara. The bit of mud is bonded to the bit of stone rabaṬa al-madara bi-l-ḥajara so that mud madar is with stone ḥajar and the One who has always been is magnified and sanctified. It is said that the House is the object of the circumambulation of bodily selves nufūs while the Real ������ is the object of the quest of hearts qulūb. The House consists of the remains and traces [of the past]. These are but relics and stones yet These traces of ours point to us. So after we [are gone] look to the traces. It is said that the House is stone but not all stone is alike. [It is] stone but it causes the hearts of the lovers to awaken muzʿij and the souls of the poor fuqarāÌ to leap munfij. Indeed for the hearts of some it is cooling and pleasant muthlij wa-mubhij and for the hearts of others [it is] stimulating and arousing munfij wa-muzʿij. [What people see in the House depends on the] different types [of people]: A House that is a place you go to seek out your loved ones and visit them mazār [or] where you hear news akhbār of them and see the traces āthār [of their having been there]. A House-whoever looks to it with the eye of separation returns with an innermost self laid waste kharāb. Whoever observes it with the eye of connection wins every approach and approval ījāb. As it is said: Truly houses even when they are silent have a pact with Our lovers since they stop at them. A House-whoever visits it with his bodily self finds His kindnesses and whoever visits it with his heart finds His unveilings. It is said that He said �and purify My House� [2:125 and 22:26] attrib- uting it to Himself."

  3,98,"Say: �O people of the scripture why do you disbelieve in God's verses when God is witness of what you doḍ� The divine address in this verse is meant to confirm the obligation of the pilgrimage [for the people of the scripture]. With respect to the law the pilgrimage is obligatory for them166 but with respect to the true state of affairs ḥaqīqa and [divine] subjugation qahr the pilgrimage is barred to them. They are called by the law and command hum madʿuwūna sharʿan wa-amran but banished by the decree and the subjugation maṬrūdūna ḥukman wa-qahran."
  3,99,"Say: �O people of the scripture why do you bar believers from God's way desiring to make it crooked while you yourselves are witnesses. God is not heedless of what you do.� How can one who is barred himself bar anotherḍ Surely in this is a secret belonging to the [divine] Lordship."
  3,100,"O you who believe if you obey a party of those who have been given the scripture they will turn you after you have believed into disbelievers. Estrangement is not restricted to just the estranged but also extends to anyone who becomes part of their circle. Whoever follows the enemy of God into this ruinous companionship will be cast down to the same level."
