tafsir[7]{c,v,t}:
  2,170,"And when it is said to them �Follow what God has revealed� they say �No; but we follow what we found our fathers doing.� Whatḍ Even if their fathers do not understand anything and they were not guidedḍ There is no raising their eyes beyond that which is like them in form class kind and ancestry for they are set on their way. Without a doubt they have plunged into the fire on their path. Had they known that their ancestors had no intelligence to restrain them nor guidance to unite them they would have withdrawn from them [understanding them to be] hostile and resisted them [understanding them to be] oppositional [to God's com- mand]. But the lights of insight were snatched from them and they were deprived of the proofs of certainty."
  2,171,"The likeness of those who disbelieve is as the likeness of one who shouts to that which hears nothing save a call and a cry; deaf dumb blind-they do not comprehend. Without the ears of comprehension and acceptance their bodily hearing did not benefit them. They descended to the status of animals incapable of actualization taḥṣīl. Whoever is content to be like an animal man raḌiya an yakūn ka-l-bahīma does not have much worth lam yaqaʿu ʿalayhi kathīr al-qīma."
  2,172,"O you who believe eat of the good things Ṭayyibāt wherewith We have provided you and give thanks to God if it be Him that you worship. The permitted ḥalāl is that for which there is no [bad] consequence. The good thing Ṭayyib is that thing whose blessing is not attributed to any created thing. When the servant finds something that combines these two qualities it is permitted and good. The true meaning of thankfulness to Him is that you do not take a breath in anything other than the pleasure of the Real so long as the energy given to you by that [permitted and good] food remains."
  2,173,"He has only forbidden you carrion blood the flesh of swine and what has been hallowed to other than God. Yet whoever is constrained not desiring nor transgressing no sin shall be on him. God is Forgiving Merciful. He has forbidden in outward circumstances these specific things which have been hallowed to other than God. He has forbidden to the innermost hearts companionship with other than God and even witnessing anything other than God. Yet whoever is constrained that is anyone who has not found a means to annihilation in the realities of the Real should only travel by way of the law. Either he should be effaced in God or stand by means of God or act for God. Otherwise he is a foolish man of no account."
  2,174,"Those who conceal what God has revealed of the scripture and sell it for a little price-they shall consume nothing in their bellies but the fire; God shall not speak to them on the Day of Resurrection neither purify them; and theirs is a painful chastisement. The scholars ʿulamāÌ are asked to spread the evidentiary proofs of knowl- edge while the friends awliyāÌ are commanded to preserve the trusts of the secret. If [the scholars] conceal the proofs of the different types of knowledge they will be bridled with a bridle of fire nār. By con- trast if [the friends] divulge even a sliver from the secret they [will be] immediately distanced from the secrets asrār and snatched away from the lights anwār they have been given. To each is a limit ḥadd and to each a command amr."
  2,175,"They are those who have bought error at the price of guidance and chastisement at the price of pardon; what makes them so patient for the fireḍ That is because God has revealed the Book with the truth; and those that are at variance regarding the Book are in schism far removed. Truly those that prefer the other ghayr over the unseen ghayb the cre- ation khalq over the Real ḥaqq the lower self nafs over intimacy uns [with God] how hard are their hearts ma aqsā qulūbahum how shameless what they love and seek wa-mā awqaḥa maḥbūbahum wa-maṬlūbahum how cheap their worth and how disgraceful for those who have eyes to see! That is because God has revealed the Book in truth and made its decree and rule come to pass in sincerity and brought them to that for which He prepared them and established them on the way He has fashioned for them."
