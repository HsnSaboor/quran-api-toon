tafsir[4]{c,v,t}:
  4,60,"Have you not seen those who claim that they believe in what has been revealed to you and what was revealed before you desiring to take their disputes to a false deity when they have been commanded to renounce himḍ But Satan desires to mislead them far astray. Outwardly they proclaimed sincerity while acting hypocritically in secret. He ������ exposed them through the tongue of Gabriel ���� ������ saying �desir- ing to take their disputes to a false deity when they have been commanded to renounce him yakfurū bihi� that is reject him. Whoever abandons his path and returns to anyone other than his master ustādh becomes deserving of exclusion and condemnation."
  4,61,"And when it is said to them �Come to what God has revealed and the Messenger� you see the hypocrites turn away from you vehemently. Everything other than the word of the Real is easy for hypocrites [to hear]. [On the other hand] the declaration of God's unity is heard only by those who are sincere. Those who are listless and those who are hostile do not hear that which is true since it is difficult for those who are not sincere to oppose personal whims. Just as the eye of the bat is incapable of facing the sun the hypocrites were unable to stand firm before [the Prophet] ﷺ and that was the cause of their vehemently turning away."
  4,62,"How would it be when an affliction befalls them for what their own hands have sent before them! They then come to you swearing by God that �We sought only virtue and harmony.� The beseeching of the insincere at the attacks of misfortune is without foundation. It deserves no consideration because it only lasts until the tribulation has passed. The greater affliction is being indifferent to the affliction [brought on by what their own hands have sent before them]. It is said that part of the affliction is being deprived [of the blessing] in the present moment by that which is of no use to you."
  4,63,"Those-God knows what is in their hearts; so turn away from them and admonish them and say to them regarding their souls penetrating words. �Be generous with them in admonition as sympathy dictates but hold your heart back from being overly concerned for them or putting your trust in them. Know that you will not be able to help those whom We do not sup- port in any way.�"
