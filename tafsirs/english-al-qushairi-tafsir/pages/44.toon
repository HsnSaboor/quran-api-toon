tafsir[3]{c,v,t}:
  2,261,"The likeness of those who expend their wealth in the way of God is as the likeness of a grain of corn that sprouts seven ears in every ear a hundred grains; so God multiplies for whom He will; God is Embracing Knowing. The compensation for [those who expend their wealth in the way of God] is the garden. The compensation of those who expend their spir- its in the way of God is the Real ������. What a difference between the compensation for one who expends his wealth and finds his reward and the [compensation for] one who expends his state and finds nearness! Expending wealth in His way [happens] by [giving] alms ṣadaqa and expending [one's] states in His way [happens] through constant sincerity ṣidq413 and by negating every worldly concern or portion so that you are pleased with the flowing of His decree over you without any frowning of the heart. The one who spoke for them said: I want to be with him but he wants me to depart. So I leave want I want for what he wants. There are two types of expenditure: the expending of worshipers ʿābidūn and the expending of ecstatics wājidūn. When worshipers give grain it multiplies for them seventy times to what is beyond reckoning. As for the ecstatics it is as it is said: There is nothing good we can bring that they will accept and if we do harm for them there is no erasure."
  2,262,"Those who expend their wealth in the way of God then do not follow up their expenditure with a reminder of their generosity and injury their wage is with their Lord and no fear shall befall them neither shall they grieve. The reminder of generosity is proclaiming what you did. The injury is point- ing out your beneficence to the one who receives it. It is said that they expend what they expend but they most assuredly do not say anything about their actions or works. It is said �How can you give something while seeking to maintain your control416 and rights over itḍ� It is said that they do not remind others of what they have done for them but rather bear witness to the favor of God [who] grants them success in that [act of generosity]."
  2,263,"Honorable words and forgiveness are better than voluntary almsgiving followed by injury; and God is Independent Forbearing. This means that words spoken to the one who is poor and deprived- responding to his overture without showing censure-are better and more perfect than the alms of one who is proud of what he does and then imposes an obligation for it. It is said that an acknowledgment from you to God of your weakness and sin and God's forgiveness for you in response to these words is better than alms adulterated with reproach and accompanied by injury."
