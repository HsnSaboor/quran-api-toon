tafsir[7]{c,v,t}:
  2,204,"And among people there is he whose speech in the life of this world pleases you; and who calls on God to witness what is in his heart; yet he is most stubborn in dispute. He relates that the Real ������ ������ has given some people skill in speaking outwardly yet [He] has turned away from their hearts which are bound by the ropes of deprivation and covered by their own ignorance. There is no meaning beyond [their outward selves] and nothing of weight in what they say. One cannot rely on their faithfulness nor trust in them in any way. The allusion is to the people of external appearances ahl al-ẓāhir who have not been helped by the lights of insight and are bound to the precepts of the external world. They have no faith in this kind of talk and no insight into this [path] as a whole. It is necessary to keep secrets from them since they will only receive this discourse with disapproval. Peaceable people among ordinary folk who have respect for this path and faith in the whole of this discourse are far closer to this way than those who count themselves among the elect but are cut off from faith in this affair."
  2,205,"And when he turns his back he hastens about the earth to do cor- ruption there and to destroy the tillage and the stock; and God loves not corruption. [Here] the allusion is to those who only hasten to seek worldly fortunes. They are not concerned even though the ties to their religion have become unraveled and their bonds to Islam have been weakened. After that the ropes [tying them to] the world become stronger and the bonds of their desires become more closely woven with the prohibited things they have gathered and the debris they have acquired. When they retire to their whis- perings and ruinous aims they hasten to corruption make decisions based on worldly [aims] and employ people to help them in furthering their affairs-people from whose hearts God has removed inner sight. And God loves not corruption: Outward corruption is whatever brings about the ruin of religious affairs and the proper ordering of worldly matters."
  2,206,"And when it is said to him �Fear God� he is seized by vainglory in his sin. So Hell shall be enough for him-how evil a cradling! Those are the people who have been seized by arrogance and who have lost the ability to humbly accept fair criticism; they turn up their noses at accepting the truth. When you enjoin someone [like this] to decency he says �How can you say this to someone like me when I am such and suchḍ� Then he turns it around and attacks you saying �You have more need to be enjoined with decency and forbidden indecency because your condi- tion is such and such...� If God had granted success to help him or mercy had reached him he would have been granted the favor shown to those who have been guided to seeing their errors and observing their bad traits. And he would not have harbored enmity toward the one who gave him the advice the traces of which remain in the heart for years. God most high said �So hell shall be enough for him� meaning [hell is] the state of his estrangement the darknesses of the lower self and the constriction of choice such that he does not hasten in anything except his [lower] desire. At every moment over and over he succumbs to [this] chastisement and trial. Then he is transported from this chastisement to the greater chastisement. God most high said �And We shall surely make them taste the nearer chastisement before the greater chastisement� [32:21]."
  2,207,"But there are other men who sell themselves desiring God's pleasure; and God is gentle with His servants. Those who have been touched by the special favors of mercy and raised up by the fate already preordained [for them] prefer the good pleasure of the Real over themselves and submit entirely to their protector mawlā. God is gentle with His servants and because of His gentleness they attain these states-they do not deserve His gentleness because of these states."
  2,208,"O you who believe come all of you into submission; and follow not the steps of Satan; he is a manifest foe to you. [God] has charged the believer with making peace with everyone except his lower self for it makes no move except to oppose [the believer's] leader sayyid. Anyone who makes peace with himself becomes listless in his spiritual exertions mujāhadāt. This is the reason a seeker falls short and an aspirant loses interest. The steps of Satan are what are whispered to you about your inability to hold to the precepts of moral behavior and [your inability] to abandon unwise inclinations that are best ignored. But it is as God most high said �If you fear for him cast him into the waters� [28:7]. Look what He did with [Moses] when [Moses's mother] cast him [into the water] and how He returned him to her after saving him!"
  2,209,"But if you slip after the clear proofs have come to you know then that God is Mighty Wise. A single slip after the disclosure of clear proofs is uglier by far than the many slips committed before this disclosure. Those who are known to be treacherous cannot be trusted. When the tribulation for the worst sins descends they will be completely uprooted."
  2,210,"What do they wait for that God shall come to them in the shadows of clouds and the angelsḍ The matter is determined and to God all matters are returned. The people thought that the Hour would be long in coming but the details tell them of the severity of the matter. [What are described] are acts af ʿāl [of God] only in the sense of the terrible events ahwāl [of that Hour]. God ������ divulges them so as to remove their doubt concerning the gran- deur of His affair and the implementation of His power in what He wills. The matter is determined and to God all matters are returned that is the veil of the unseen is removed exposing the clarity of the [divine] preordination. The hearts of those who declare His oneness are lit by the lights of insights and [therefore] they have no need to seek interpretation taÌwīl of this verse and those like it since [they know] the Real ������ is far removed from any change in locality or fading or specificity in place or time. He is sanctified from every movement and appearing [before human beings]."
