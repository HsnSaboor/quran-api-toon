  2,167,"And those who followed say �O if only we might return again and disown them as they have disowned us!� So God shall show them their works anguish for them! Never shall they exit from the Fire. At that time they will know the bitter taste of the companionship of created things but they will not be able to attain anything but anguish."
  2,168,"O people eat of what is in the earth lawful and wholesome; and fol- low not the steps of Satan; he is a manifest foe to you; That which is forbidden even if it is pleasing now is contaminated in the end. That which is permitted even if it is hateful now is wholesome in the end. The pure and permitted [can be understood as] that which is acquired without forgetting the Real. It is said that that which is permitted is what the gatherer obtains for His sake and acquires while witnessing the Real in every state. Anything that causes you to forget the Real or disobey the Real is from the steps of Satan."
  2,169,"he only commands you to evil and indecency and that you should speak against God what you do not know. Because of his audacity toward God he induces you to speak falsely about God."
