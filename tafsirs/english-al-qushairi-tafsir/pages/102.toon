tafsir[7]{c,v,t}:
  4,148,"God does not like the utterance of evil words out loud unless a person has been wronged. God is ever Hearer Knower. What a person who has been wronged says about the one who has wronged him is not evil in the true sense of the word by the permission of God but it is nonetheless a good thing to let the matter drop. God most high has said �For the requital of an evil is an evil deed like it� [42:40] so requital is not an evil deed. [But whoever pardons and reconciles his reward will be with God. Truly He does not like wrongdoers] [42:40]. It is said that anyone who knows that his Protector hears is ashamed to give free voice to the urgings of his lower self. It is said that evil words out loud are what you hear within yourself [when] you think ill thoughts about others. The elect take responsibility in their inward thoughts for that which if heard [out loud] from ordinary people might be held against them. Unless illā a person has been wronged: Some say [this means] �not even wa-lā the one who has been wronged.� Others say its meaning is this: �But wa-lakinna a person who has been wronged� has the right to mention the one who has intentionally wronged him. It is said that those who do not prefer praise of the Real madḥ al-ḥaqq over defaming one's fellow creatures qadḥ al-khalq have been cheated of the present moment. It is said that those who look to created beings with the eye of connect- ing to the Real [see] that they are servants of God [and] will speak no ill of them. A man says to his companion �Out of respect for you I will bear the lowliest149 service to you even beyond that which I would bear for my son.� When there is commitment like this between human beings how much more worthy is the servant's regard for refined behavior adab between him and His Protector! It is said that God does not like the utterance of evil words out loud among ordinary people nor does He like that in the inward thoughts of the elect. It is said that the utterance of evil words out loud among ordinary people is their description of God in ways [for which they] have no permission or divine sanction."
  4,149,"If you show good or conceal it or pardon evil then surely God is ever Pardoning Powerful. If you show good taking on the good manners found in the law takhal- luqan bi-ādābi al-sharīʿa or conceal recognizing the truth in the precepts of the deeper reality taḥaqquqan bi-aḥkāmi al-ḥaqīqa or pardon evil adopting from God what He has entrusted you with in the most beauti- ful ways of behaving then surely God is ever Pardoning of your defects li-ʿuyūbikum Powerful in causing you to attain what you love ʿalā taḥsīli maḥbūbikum and causing you to recognize the true nature of what you seek wa-taḥqīqi maṬlūbikum. It is said that if you show good you will be an example for humankind in what you practice and in what you propose to others who might be guided from the way of your practice. If you conceal it content with only His knowing it and safeguard yourselves from the evils of affectation and trust that those of you who act for Him will be seen and known by Him or pardon evil that is you abandon150 what your lower selves call you to-then God will grant you His pardon for what you do. He [also] has the power to afflict you with that which the oppressor is afflicted with. This then is a warning to them about being heedless in witnessing the favor minna and a way of alerting them to the fact that they should seek refuge from being deprived of protection ʿiṣma and seek refuge from being abandoned so that they fall into discord fitna and trial miḥna. It is said [the verse means] if you show good acting well toward people or conceal it praying for them in secret or pardon evil even if you have been wronged [then surely God is ever Pardoning Powerful]. It is said concerning those who act well toward you show them good outwardly. Those who spare you from their evil be loyal in friendship and pray for them inwardly. Those who act badly toward you pardon them with generosity and graciousness. You will find pardon from God according to what you yourself do for surely your sins are more numerous. He has the power to give you in favor and blessings that which you cannot attain by taking vengeance or revenge."
  4,150,"Those who disbelieve in God and His messengers and seek to divide between God and His messengers and say �We believe in some and disbelieve in some� and seek to adopt a way between them. Those are the disbelievers truly; and We have prepared for the disbe- lievers a humiliating chastisement. [God] relates that they have added the blameworthy actions enumerated here to the shamefulness of their disbelief. He explains that He has doubled their chastisement as requital for their sin so that you will know that He is ever on the watch [89:14] over those who act in corrupt and harmful ways."
  4,151,"Those who disbelieve in God and His messengers and seek to divide between God and His messengers and say �We believe in some and disbelieve in some� and seek to adopt a way between them.

  4,152,"And those who believe in God and His messengers and do not seek to divide between any of them those-We shall surely give them their wages. God is ever Forgiving Merciful. When they believed in all of the messengers and confirmed everything to which they were commanded they deserved acceptance and the beautiful recompense. To let go of one's faith in some individuals is to let go of one's faith in [the messages sent in other] time periods. Just as [God] will not accept the faith of a person whose faith does not include all the messages that have come before him likewise He will not accept the faith of a per- son whose faith does not include all that faith demands of him since [God] made that a condition for its actualization taḥqīq and perfection kamāl. This alludes to the fact that anyone who does not wholeheartedly enter into the covenant will not have so much as a sliver of the reality of com- munion [of lovers]. The Prophet ﷺ said �The pilgrimage is [the day of] ʿArafa.� Anyone who traverses the distance even if he comes from a deep ravine but then holds back even a little from ʿArafāt has not experienced the pilgrimage. The Prophet ﷺ said �The servant who has contracted with his master to be freed is still a servant to the last dirham.�"
  4,153,"The people of the scripture will ask of you to cause a Book to be revealed to them from the heaven. They asked Moses for something greater than that for they said �show us God openly�; so the thunderbolt seized them for their evildoing. They then took to themselves the [golden] calf after clear proofs had come to them; yet We pardoned that; and We bestowed upon Moses clear authority. The verse includes two kinds of unseemly acts. The first was their asking to be shown [God] and the second was their worshiping the calf after clear signs had been made manifest to them. Their asking to be shown [God] was blameworthy because they impudently demanded it and there was no excuse for this after miracles had come to them. Therefore they were not seeking the vision for instruction nor as a means to confirm their faith nor were they brought to that [point] by intense longing. This shows a lack of manners sūÌ adab. There is an allusion [in the reference] to those who are content to have the calf as their object of worship. While submitting themselves to it how can they bear witness to the Realḍ It is said that the innermost selves of the people were untouched by deeper knowledge and they therefore clung with their intellects to a lim- ited thing maḥdūd allowing that to be their object of worship maʿbūd. And we bestowed upon Moses clear authority: a manifest proof-indeed a light that preserved him from declaring any likeness [to God] tamthīl or stripping [Him] of His attributes taʿṬīl. The clear authority is actualization taḥṣīl and declaring God incom- parable tanzīh neither stripping God of His attributes taʿṬīl nor compar- ing Him to His creation tashbīh. It is said that the clear authority is the power to hear the [divine] speech al-khiṬāb without intermediary. It is said that the clear authority belongs to this community in the future and it is their abiding in the state of meeting [God]. In the tradition of the vision [the Prophet] ﷺ said �You will not be gathered together [in one group] in seeing Him.�"
  4,154,"And We raised above them the mount by the covenant with them and We said to them �Enter the gate bowing�; and We said to them �Transgress not the Sabbath and We took from them a firm covenant. The more signs were given to them outwardly the more denial and rejec- tion there was in their hearts. Receiving more communications did not benefit them since the eyes of their hearts were not open to witnessing [these communications]. God most high said �But signs and warners do not avail a folk who will not believe� [10:101]."
