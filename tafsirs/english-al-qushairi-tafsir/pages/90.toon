tafsir[5]{c,v,t}:
  4,75,"What is wrong with you that you do not fight in the way of God and for the oppressed men women and children who say �Our Lord bring us forth from this town whose people are evildoers and appoint for us a protector from You and appoint for us a helper from You.� �What is it that prevents you from fighting in the way of Godḍ What holds you back from desiring to give your lifeblood for Godḍ How would it be to your disadvantage to offer up your spirits in God and for Godḍ Are you afraid that you will give less than what is due to Godḍ Or do you not know that you will be gathered to Godḍ Why is it not enough that He remains after you have been annihilated in Godḍ"
  4,76,"Those who believe fight in the way of God and those who disbelieve fight in the way of a false deity. Fight therefore against the friends of Satan; surely the plotting of Satan is ever feeble. Those who are sincerely devoted to God do not prefer anything to God and they do not hold anything back from God. They are ever against their lower selves for the sake of God. The states of those who disbelieve are the reverse of [those of] the believers. Therefore He strengthened and encouraged [the believers] saying Fight therefore against the friends of Satan that is �do not feel any fear toward them for I am taking care of your affairs and will suffice for you against your enemies.�"
  4,77,"Say �The enjoyment of this world is trifling; and the hereafter is bet- ter for him who fears; and you shall not be wronged a single date thread. He gave you power over this world but then said �The enjoyment of this world is trifling� so it is of no account for you. If you were to give alms from it so much as half a date you would be saved from the fire and reach the garden. This is the most extraordinary generosity. Caring little about what comes to you-because of your beloved-is the strongest indicator of your relationship. It is said that when He wants you to forsake the present world He makes it seem meager in your eyes so that abandoning it will be easy for you. It is said: Say �The enjoyment of this world-the sum total of it-is trifling. Since your portion is less than [this] trifling [amount] why would He quarrel with you over the details of what is permitted taḥlīl so long as your pact remains secure from alteration tabdīlḍ If the value of this world is trifling then the cheapest of the cheap are those who are content with the cheap khasīs in lieu of the precious nafīs. The believer is torn from the worlds of being kawn in degrees. First He said �say 'The enjoyment of this world is trifling; and the hereafter is better'�-He seizes them from the present world by what comes next. Then He robs them of both worlds saying But what is with God is better and more lasting [42:36]."
  4,78,"Wherever you may be death will overtake you though you should be in raised-up towers.� And if a good thing befalls them they say �This is from God�; but if an evil thing befalls them they say �This is from you.� Say �Everything is from God.� What is wrong with this people that they do not understandḍ Death is joy to the believer and the news of its drawing near is good news to him because it is a means of reaching the Real. Whoever loves to meet God God loves to meet him. It is said that since death is inevitable submitting to His decree willingly is better than tolerating it unwillingly. Moreover He told them that because of the weakness of their facul- ties of insight and the infirmity of their beliefs they are joyful and show gratitude when a good thing befalls them. But if an evil thing befalls them they are not guided to God. The Magian disposition flows in them so that they attribute aḌāfū [the evil thing] to something that is created. [God] replied to them saying �say to them O Muḥammad 'Everything is from God through [the acts of] creating and originating producing and invent- ing decreeing and facilitating.'�"
  4,79,"Whatever good befalls you it is from God; whatever evil befalls you is from yourself. We have sent you to people as a messenger and God suffices as Witness. Whatever good befalls you is a bounty from God and whatever evil befalls you is from yourself through acquisition kasb. Both of them are created by God ������."
