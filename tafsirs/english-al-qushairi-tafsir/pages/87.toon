tafsir[6]{c,v,t}:
  4,52,"Have you not seen those who were given a share of the Book how they believe in al-Jibt and al-Ṭāghūt and say to the disbelievers �These are more rightly guided than the believers�ḍ Those are the ones whom God has cursed; and he whom God has cursed you will never find for him any helper. The Ṭāghūt of each person is his lower self and his whim-the idol he seeks among that which is other than [God]. When someone pays heed to a person or looks to a reason or turns to a cause or obeys a whim that thing is his jibt and his Ṭāghūt.61 The companions of al-Jibt and al-Ṭāghūt deserve the curse which is being expelled from the carpet of service ʿubūdiyya and veiled from witnessing lordship rubūbiyya."
  4,53,"Or have they a share in the kingdomḍ then they would not give the people a single date spot naqīr. Or are they jealous of people for the bounty that God has bestowed upon them. For We gave the House of Abraham the Book and wisdom and We gave them a mighty kingdom. And there are some of them who believe in him and some of them who bar [others] from him. Hell suffices for a blaze. When those prone to avarice receive abundance it only increases their distress at the comfort others receive. It is as if such a person drinks water sparingly drop by drop yet gulps down and even drains the very water of his life. Or are they jealous of people... Indeed out of jealousy they reject the choice of the Real ������ [who has chosen] whom He will for His friends and they do notapproach them withreverence. The way sunna of God������with His friends entails [His] elevation and protection of their honor. The custom of disbelievers is to question and doubt the [divine] power of deliberation so there are some who believe and accept [the friends of God] and some who reject and deny.  The punishment of God is sufficient as an avenger to them. And We gave them a mighty kingdom: The mighty kingdom mulk is true knowledge maʿrifa of the King. It is said that it is dominion mulk over the lower self. It is said that it is standing above the secrets of the realm mamlaka so that nothing is hidden. It is said that it is the viewing of the secrets of creation from on high."

  4,56,"Surely those who disbelieve in Our signs-We shall expose them to a fire; as often as their skins are consumed We shall replace them with other skins that they may taste the chastisement. Surely God is ever Mighty Wise. This alludes to those who deny the signs of the friends. He causes them to remain in a state of insignificance yuqīmuhum bi-waṣfi al-ṣighār and leaves them to the estrangement of denial wa-yabqiyahum fī waḥshati al-inkār. Whenever something appears to their hearts from this story their rejection leads them to abandon faith in it and to dismiss its people with contempt so they are punished over and over again."
  4,57,"And those that believe and perform righteous deeds We shall admit them to gardens underneath which rivers flow wherein they abide: they shall have therein spouses purified and We shall admit them to plenteous shade. Today they are in the shade of [God's] care riʿāya and tomorrow in the shade of [His] protection ḥimāya and sufficiency kifāya. Indeed they are in the shade of solicitude ʿināya in this world and the next. People in this group are of different types: There are those who are in the shade of His mercy those who are in the shade of His care those who are in the shade of His special generosity those who are in the shade of His solicitude and those who are in the shade of His nearness."
  4,59,"O you who believe obey God and obey the Messenger and those in authority among you. If you should quarrel about anything refer it to God and the Messenger if you believe in God and the Last Day; that is better and more excellent in interpretation. He compares obedience to Him with obedience to the Messenger ﷺ hon- oring his affair and elevating his status. Those in authority ulū l-amr: In scholarly terms this means the [worldly] ruler sulṬān. According to the explanation of deeper knowl- edge maʿrifa the one who has deeper knowledge ʿārif has authority dhū l-amr over the one who is just starting out. The shaykh has authority over the aspirant murīd. The leader imām of each group has authority over [the members of the group]. It is said that the friend and guardian walī of the aspirant is better awlā for the aspirant than the aspirant [himself]. If you should quarrel about anything refer it to God: In scholarly lan- guage this means the Book and the sunna. [But] according to the explana- tion of God's unity bayān al-tawḥīd it is to commit and entrust knowledge of [the matter] to God ������. When two conflicting inclinations arise in the heart of a believer and [the believer] has [access to] the reasoning provided by religious scholars he can contemplate what he understands from their understanding. A master of the heart [on the other hand] entrusts [the matter] to the Real ������ and pays heed to what is said to him in his inner- most self and what has been cast into his heart without any intermediary."
