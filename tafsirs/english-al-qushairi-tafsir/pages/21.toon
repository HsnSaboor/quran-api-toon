tafsir[5]{c,v,t}:
  2,135,"And they say �Be Jews or Christians and you will be guided.� Say �Nay rather the creed of Abraham a ḥanīf; and he was not of the idolaters.� [That is] �When the groups contended with you [Muḥammad] they demanded that you agree muwāfaqa with them. Stand firm in opposing that to which they call you and turn your attention increasingly to Us. Follow the way of the Friend al-khalīl in withdrawing from the group whether it be one's own father or anyone else who is not in accord lā yuwāfiqu with his Protector.� Thus he said �And I shall shun you and that which you call upon besides God� [19:48]. The ḥanīf is the �one who leans� toward the straight truth on the path the truth free from any defect of creation. [He is] in agreement wāfiq with the truth by the Truth."
  2,136,"Say: �We believe in God and in that which has been revealed to us and revealed to Abraham Ishmael Isaac Jacob and the tribes and that which was given to Moses and Jesus and the prophets from their Lord we make no division between any of them and to Him we submit.� Because our Prophet ﷺ believed in everything that was revealed before him he was honored with everything that [God] had conferred in honor to [the prophets] before him. When [God] proclaimed the harmony muwāfaqa of all [the messages of the prophets] He entrusted everything in existence [to fall] under [Muḥammad's] banner. [Muḥammad] said �Adam and all others shall be under my banner on the Day of the Resurrection.� When his community believed in everything that God revealed to His messengers and made no division between any of them they drew the highest share in honor and took precedence over all communities."
  2,139,"Say: �Would you then dispute with us concerning God and He is our Lord and your Lordḍ Our deeds belong to us and to you belong your deeds and to Him we are sincerely devoted.� How can dispute with strangers be appropriate when they are covered by absence and shaded by concealment while the friends are lit by unveiling and the bright noon of witnessingḍ When is the state of one who is bankrupt by his absence equal to one whose selection and sincere devotion [and] immersion in acts of drawing near to Him has [already been] decreedḍ It is preposterous-there is no equality!"
  2,140,"Or do you say: �Abraham Ishmael Isaac and Jacob and the tribes- they were Jews or they were Christiansḍ� Say: �Have you then greater knowl- edge or has Godḍ And who does greater injustice than he who conceals a testimony received from Godḍ And God is not heedless of what you do.� Whoever looks from himself to creation forms an image of each thing based on his own character and considers everything to be something like him. When they by virtue of being outsiders [to the Real] judged the prophets [���� ������] according to their own state the Real ������ threw their conjecture back upon them and left them with their own opinion. Are those who have been drawn away from their own testimony like those who are veiled by itḍ Is the one who is snatched away from all of it equal to the one who is thrown back to what is like himḍ That is the conjecture of those who disbelieve-what misery is theirs!"
  2,141,"That is a community that has passed away; theirs is what they have earned and yours is what you have earned; you will not be asked about what they did. The barriers of fate came between you and them for they built their struc- tures on separation and heedlessness while you have pitched your tents on closeness and connection. The freedman of Our favor ʿatīq faḌlinā is not like the fugitive of Our force Ṭarīd qahrinā."
