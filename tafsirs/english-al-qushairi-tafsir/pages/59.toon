tafsir[5]{c,v,t}:
  3,71,"O people of the scripture! Why do you confound truth with falsehood and conceal the truth while you knowḍ �You conceal the truth regarding the affair of Muḥammad ﷺ while you know that he is the Prophet who speaks truly.� Can this be anything other than the divine ruling to forsake ḥukm al-khidhlān and the decision to deprive qaḌiyyat al-ḥirmān [those who confound and conceal the truth]ḍ Then He informed them that among them there were some hypocrites. They wanted to forestall any trouble with the Muslims while also avoiding conflict with their brothers among the disbelievers. Thus they conspired to pretend to agree publicly with the Messenger ﷺ and the Muslims while secretly to remain true among themselves to their corrupt beliefs."
  3,72,"A party of the people of scripture say �Believe in what has been revealed to those who believe at the beginning of the day and disbelieve at the end of it so that they might then turn back. [By this verse] God ������ showed that their hypocrisy was exposed to the Muslims and that it had not benefited them either in this world because God informed His Prophet ���� ������ and the believers of it or in the hereafter because [their hypocrisy] deprived them of sincere devotion [toward God]."
  3,75,"And of the people of the scriptures is he who if you trust him with a hundredweight he will return it to you; and of them is he who if you trust him with one dinar will not return it to you; unless you keep standing over him. That is because they say �We have no duty toward the Gentiles. They speak falsehood against God while they are aware. He relates that [the people of the scripture] notwithstanding their error and disbelief vary in their moral qualities. All of them have broken the trust amāna of the religion dīn but among them are those who have regard for proper [human] interactions. Even though they interact with sincerity it will not benefit them in receiving reward but it will benefit them in lessening [their] punishment since disbelievers are held accountable in the details of the laws. If in their disbelief they sinned less they will suf- fer less punishment than those who have lost the most even though their punishment will also be in perpetuity. Then He explained that the judgment is not theirs so that when they say �We have no duty toward the Gentiles� the situation is not as they would have it nor will these words benefit them. Rather the judgment belongs to God ������."
  3,76,"Nay but whoever fulfils his covenant and has fear for truly God loves the God-fearing. Those who hold to the covenant are deserving of being united in friendship honor and the garden. Those who are in error are deserving of aversion ignominy and shame."
  3,77,"Those that sell God's covenant and their own oaths for a small price there shall be no share for them in the hereafter; and God shall not speak to them nor look upon them on the Day of Resurrection nor will He purify them and theirs will be a painful chastisement. Those who prefer their caprice hawāhum over their final outcome ʿuqbāhum and have given priority to their desires munāhum over har- monious agreement with their Protector mawlāhum will have no share in the hereafter. Because they have chosen to seek pleasure in the present they have lost in the two abodes and they remain apart from the Real. The pleasure they sought in worldly things ḥaẓẓ has brought upon them all kinds of tribulations but they are not aware of what has happened to them: God shall not speak to them nor look upon them on the Day of Resurrection nor will He purify them. Moreover He will cause them to remain in the punishment beyond the count of time."
