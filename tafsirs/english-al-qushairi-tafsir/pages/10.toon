tafsir[7]{c,v,t}:
  2,62,"Surely those who believe and those of the Jews and the Christians and the Sabaeans whoever believes in God and the Last Day and performs righteous deeds-their wage is with their Lord and no fear shall befall them neither shall they grieve. The diversity of [religious] paths in spite of the unity of the source does not prevent a goodly acceptance [for all]. For anyone who affirms the Real ������ in His signs and believes in what He has said concerning His truth and attributes the dissimilarity of [religious] laws and diversity that occurs in [the] name[s] [of religion] is not a problem in terms of who merits [God's] good pleasure. Because of that He said �Surely those who believe and those of the Jews.� Then He said �whoever believes� meaning if they fear [God] in [their] different ways of knowing [Him] all of them will have a beautiful place of return and an ample reward. The believer muÌmin is anyone in the protection amān of the Real ������. For anyone who is in His protection it is fitting that no fear shall befall them neither shall they grieve."
  2,63,"And when We made a covenant for you and We raised above you the mount �Take forcefully what We have given you and remember what is in it so that you might preserve yourselves.� Then you turned away thereafter and but for God's bounty and His mercy toward you you would have been among the losers. He ������ made a covenant with all responsible beings and some responded willingly because He made Himself known to them and they declared His unity fa-waḥḥadūhu. Other people responded unwill- ingly because He veiled them so they did not want to recognize Him fa-jaḥadūhu. There is no proof more powerful than the eyewitnessing of the mount Ṭūr He raised above them which was a mountain jabal but they lacked the light of inner sight baṣīra and so the witnessing of physical vision baṣar did not benefit them. Then you turned away thereafter that is you returned to disobedience after witnessing the signs with your own eyes. If not for His decree in grant- ing respite and His forbearance through acts of grace He would punish you without delay and cause a great misfortune to descend upon you and your deeds would be entirely a loss."

  2,65,"And verily you know that there were those among you who transgressed the Sabbath and We said to them �Be apes despised!� The metamorphosis maskh of this community occurred in their hearts. When [the children of Israel] abandoned [God's] command and disdained the laws that were imposed on them the punishments came quickly in their disgrace metamorphosis and in the other things which are included in the [QurÌānic text]. Because of their violation of the covenant and rejection of the limit [imposed by God] the community was punished through the metamorphosis of their hearts and the alteration of their states. [God] most high said �And We shall confound their hearts and their eyes; just as they did not believe the first time� [6:110]. The punishments of hearts are far worse than the punishments of the bodily selves. About this they have recited: O you who ask me �How have you been after himḍ� I suffered that which tormented me while it made him happy. I kept strutting about in our togetherness and felt safe from the ruses of time. But the turning away from me went on until not a bit of what I had experienced remained."
  2,66,"And We made it an exemplary punishment for all the former times and for the latter and an admonition to those who fear. Thus the states of those who were tried by abandonment muniya bi-l- hijrān and branded with disappointment wusima bi-l-khidhlān became a lesson-to look at what happened to them is to choke on grief. The one who is reduced to misery after having had status becomes an object of scorn before every ignoble person. This is what remains for those who have been brought low after [experiencing] the wrath of kings and [being] shunned by chieftains: The youths surrounded and ganged up on me. From behind they called the dogs on me."
  2,68,"And when Moses said to his people �God commands you to sacrifice a cow.� It was obligatory for them to execute the command directly but they wasted time with external appearances imagining that they had the leisure to linger in their digression from the obligation of the covenant. So their misery was doubled and the ignominy they had been warned about overtook them. When He said: �She is a cow neither old nor virgin middling between the two... � [2:68] it meant she would be neither young nor aged but some- where between the two. The allusion is to the fact that one who is suited for this path Ṭarīqa is one who is neither attracted by the impetuosity of youth and its drunkenness nor paralyzed by the weakness and frailty of old age. Rather he is alert; he has regained consciousness from his drunkenness yet retains some of the vigor of his youth."
  2,69,"�... a golden cow bright in color gladdening to beholders.� They said �Pray to your Lord for us that He make clear to us what she may be; the cows are all alike to us; and if God wills we shall then be guided.� Just as her [bright] color would have been perceived by the eyes the allu- sion here is to those of the people of the story ahl al-qiṣṣa whose witnessing overwhelms the hearts [of others] because of that which is clothed with the garment of invincibility jabarūt and made to rise from the witness of the unseen. One notices that someone like this is oblivious to human states and is overtaken by the remembrance of the Real. Thus in the transmitted tradition: The friends of God are those who when they are seen God is remembered."
