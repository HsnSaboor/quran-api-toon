tafsir[2]{c,v,t}:
  2,211,"Ask the children of Israel how many a clear proof did We give them; whoever changes God's grace after it has come to him God is severe in retribution. The benefit of questioning [the children of Israel] was to make them acknowledge the issue of proof. Questioning them was not for the pur- poses of resolving any doubt on the part of the Messenger ﷺ concerning what had been plainly established by proof. Whoever changes God's grace after it has come to him God is severe in retribution in taking this grace away. At that moment they will recognize its worth and then they will mourn it since they will never attain it. The one who spoke for them said: You will leave and abandon me.Then you will look for me but you will not find me."
  2,212,"Decked out fair to the disbelievers is the life of this world; and they deride the believers; but those who fear shall be above them on the Day of Resurrection; and God sustains whomever He will without reckoning. They were deceived without realizing it. The increasing darkness of their vision caused them to slander and to deride the friends [of God] ������. When people bear witness [on the Day of Resurrection] and when the error of ignorance is dispelled from their hearts they will know those who are in a state of loss and those who have gone far astray."
