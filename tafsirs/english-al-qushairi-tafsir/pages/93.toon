tafsir[2]{c,v,t}:
  4,92,"It is not for a believer to slay a believer except by mistake. He who slays a believer by mistake then let him set free a believing slave and blood- money is to be submitted to his family unless they remit it as a charity. If he belongs to a people at war with you and is a believer then the setting free of a believing slave. If he belongs to a people between whom and you there is a covenant then the blood-money must be paid to his family and the setting free of a believing slave. But if he has not the wherewithal then the fasting of two successive months a relenting from God. And God is ever Knowing Wise. [God] mitigated the matter of someone who mistakenly [slays a believer] by giving the burden of restitution to the larger group responsible for the blood-money ʿāqila. The elite are responsible for the blood-money for the weak and oppressed mustaḌʿafūn in the community. The people of deeper knowledge ahl al-maʿrifa are responsible for the blood-money for the aspirants murīdūn. The shaykhs are responsible for the blood-money for the poor fuqarāÌ. Their way is to bear the burdens that afflict the weak and oppressed."
  4,93,"And whoever slays a believer deliberately his requital is hell abiding therein and God's wrath is with him and has cursed him and has prepared for him a mighty chastisement. Just as the slaying of another [human being] has been prohibited to you so is slaying yourself: whoever follows his whims sets out to shed his own blood. Whoever does not give good counsel and admonition to an aspirant and does not assist him in his resolve is endeavoring to shed [the aspirant's] blood. Such a person is held captive to his own state-it is fitting that the consequence to him should be an unpleasant one for he should not enjoy [the states] from which he has held aspirants back. [God] ������ said �O David when you see someone seeking me become a servant to him.�"
