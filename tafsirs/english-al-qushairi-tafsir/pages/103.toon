  4,155,"So for their breaking their covenant and disbelieving in the signs of God and slaying the prophets wrongfully and for their saying �Our hearts are covered up�-nay but God sealed them for their disbelief; so they do not believe except for a few. Its meaning is: Because they committed these prohibited acts li-irtikābihim hādhihi al-manāhī and because they were marked by acts that deserve punishment wa-li-ittiṣāfihim bi-hādhihi al-majāzī We caused them to alight at the dwellings of disgrace aḥlalnāhum manāzila al-hawān and sent down upon them punishments of all kinds wa-anzalnā bihim min al-ʿuqūbati funūna al-alwān. It is said that the misfortune of their oppositional acts affected them cumulatively. One of the consequences of acting disobediently is being left to commit even more prohibited acts. By violating the covenant and not repenting they were pulled toward disbelief in [God's] signs. Then because of the misfortune of this disbelief they were left to themselves until they slew the prophets ���� ������ wrongfully. Then because of the misfortune of [these ever more shameful acts] they had the audacity to claim a keen ability to comprehend saying �Our hearts are the vessels for all kinds of knowledge.� God replied to them �but God sealed them for their dis- belief.� He hid the place of deeper knowledge ʿirfān from them and they wandered about in their errors."
  4,156,"And for their disbelief and their uttering against Mary a tremendous calumny. To transgress the limit is error just as it is error to diminish or subtract from the truth. Some people slandered Mary and accused her of fornication. Others transgressed the limit in a terrible calumny saying her son was the son of God. Both of these groups fell into error. It is said that Mary [���� ������] was a friend waliyya of God through whom two groups become miserable: those who exceed all bounds ahl al-ifrāṬ and those who fall short ahl al-tafrīṬ. This is also how it is with His friends-those who reject [the friends] suffer from their lack of respect for them and those who believe things about [the friends] that cannot be said of them suffer from their excessive adulation of them. This is something that most of the great ones have had to endure."
  4,157,"And for their saying �We slew the Messiah Jesus son of Mary the Messenger of God.� And yet they did not slay him nor did they crucify him but he was given the resemblance. And those who disagree concerning him are surely in doubt regarding him. They do not have any knowledge of him only the pursuit of conjecture; and they did not slay him for certain. Nay God raised him up to Him. God is ever Mighty Wise. It is said that God caused the one who slandered [Jesus] to resemble him and he was killed and crucified in his place. There is a saying that one who digs a grave for his brother falls into it. It is [also] said that Jesus ���� ������ said �Whoever agrees to have my resem- blance cast upon him so that he is killed in place of me will have the garden� and one of his companions agreed. It is said that because [this companion] patiently bore the injury talaf he was not deprived of the recompense khalaf from God. God most high said �Indeed We do not leave the reward of those of good deeds to go to waste� [18:30]. It is said that because this man who was a companion of Jesus ���� ������ was without any imperfection in his lower self nafs he became [Jesus's] friend in spirit rūḥ. When Jesus ���� ������ was raised up to the place of intimacy maḥall al-zulfa the spirit of this one who ransomed [Jesus] with his lower self was raised up to the place of nearness maḥall al-qurba."

  4,159,"And there is not one of the people of the scripture but will assuredly believe in him before his death; and on the Day of Resurrection he will be a witness against them. Because He determined that there will be no protection amān granted to them at the time of despair their faith īmān at that time will not benefit them. This tells us that what is taken into consideration [comes from] the protection āmān granted by the Real not from the faith īmān of the servant."
  4,161,"And because of the evildoing of some of those of the Jews We have forbidden them certain good things that were lawful for them and because of their barring from God's way many. And because of their taking usury when they had been forbidden it and their consuming people's wealth through falsehood and We have prepared for the disbelievers among them a painful chastisement. It is said that committing prohibited acts leads to the forbidding of what had been permitted. Whoever commits a prohibited act with his outward self is forbidden that which he used to find in his permitted states and the subtle kindnesses received in his innermost self."
