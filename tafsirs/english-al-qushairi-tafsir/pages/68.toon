tafsir[6]{c,v,t}:
  3,141,"And that God may prove the believers and efface the disbelievers. The tests of the unseen are a kind of smelting for the servant. Through various stages He purifies him from faults so that he becomes like pure gold without any dross. In this way one becomes clear of defects and purified for God. And efface the disbelievers in the wadis of dispersion tafriqa. As for the scum it passes away as dross [13:17]."
  3,142,"Or did you suppose that you should enter paradise without God know- ing who among you have struggled and who are patient. The wish of those who think they can arrive at a greatly esteemed place without enduring hardships casts them into the abyss of destruction. On the other hand those who recognize the value of [the place] that is sought will have the exertion of their pains made easy for them: Time is not generous with its pleasures for those who are reluctant to throw off restraints. Their speaker said: When youth is on the lookout for the lightning of meanings al-maʿānī the least valuable use of time is the pleasantry of sleep."
  3,143,"You were longing for death before you met it. Now you have seen it looking on. The pangs of longing come after being patient in enduring difficulties yet When tears flow down cheeks The one who is crying is distinguished from the one who is only pretending."
  3,145,"It is not for any soul to die save by the leave of God a prescribed term. And whoever desires the reward of this world We will give him of it; and whoever desires the reward of the hereafter We will give him of it; and We will requite the thankful. The breaths have a set duration for which there is no increase or decrease. And whoever desires the reward of this world We will give him of it: The righteous have what comes in the end ʿāqiba and the others have heedlessness ghafla. And whoever desires the reward of the hereafter We will give him of it: The reward of the hereafter is first of all forgiveness ghufrān then the gardens jinān then beatitude riḌwān. And We will requite the thankful: The requital for thankfulness is thankfulness."
  3,146,"How many a prophet has been killed and with him thousands manifold [fought] but they fainted not in the face of what afflicted them in God's way; they neither weakened nor did they humble themselves. And God loves the patient. Those who followed the course in fidelity who stood fast with regard to purity who did not withdraw from the path ṭarīq and who demanded realization of themselves reproaching themselves by restriction and scrutiny - they found the love of the Real s as a legacy for their patience. The Real was what came after for them at the end of their affair since they did not swerve from the required effort or from the protection of the pact and they submitted themselves utterly abandoning the present world. Every one of them was constant and abiding in holding to the pact and staying true to the condition of service and love."
  3,147,"All that they said was 'Our Lord forgive us our sins and our excesses in our affairs and make firm our feet and help us against the unbelieving folk'. They recognized the realities of meaning ḥaqāÌiq al-maʿnā and held their tongues from making any claims. Then they spoke seeking forgiveness and holding to an attitude of shyness just as it has been said: \tHe avoided misdeeds  and then even became afraid of them. \tInstead it was as if his good deeds  were misdeeds."
