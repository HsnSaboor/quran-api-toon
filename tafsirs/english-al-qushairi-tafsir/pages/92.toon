tafsir[5]{c,v,t}:
  4,87,"God-there is no god except Him He will surely gather you on the Day of Resurrection whereof there is no doubt. And who is truer in state- ment than Godḍ This address contains both a negation and an affirmation. The negation concerns what is other than God-what is negated is impossible for them. The affirmation belongs to Him through [His] divinity. It is not possible to deny what He has affirmed for Himself."
  4,88,"What is wrong with you that you have become two parties regarding the hypocrites when God has overthrown them for what they earnedḍ What do you desire to guide him whom God has sent astrayḍ And he whom God sends astray you will never find for him a way. �Hold to the covenant regarding them for they are My enemies aʿdāÌī. Neither in this world or the next will they receive My good pleasure riḌāÌī. Your concern for them will not save them from what has been determined by My decree qismatī. The decrees do not revolve around [human] anxieties.�"
  4,89,"They long that you should disbelieve as they disbelieve so then you would be equal; therefore do not take friends from among them until they emigrate in the way of God; then if they turn away take them and slay them wherever you find them; and do not take any of them as a patron or as a helper. Except those who attach themselves to a people between whom and you there is a covenant or come to you with their breasts constricted about the prospect of fighting you or fighting their people. Had God willed He would have given them sway over you so that assuredly they would have fought you. And so if they stay away from you and do not fight you and offer you peace then God does not allow you any way against them. [This] alludes to those in confused and sickly states-they wish that the sincere would be like them. How absurd that their desire should come true! Until your antagonists stop trying to thwart you separate yourselves from them oppose them and do not change your state to suit them. Do not associate with them and do not take any of them as a patron or as a helper. Someone who is in harmony with your goal is better for you than forced association with someone who opposes you. Except those who attach themselves to a people... This verse is an allusion to [the fact] that He gives leave with these exceptions to associate outwardly in a kindly manner with those who are in a weak and oppressed condition. And so if they stay away from you... this alludes to [the case] when someone who is not one of the people of the story associates with you. If they are intent on remaining in their familiar areas of worldly concerns do not call them to your path but leave them be in peace. If [God] gives you the opportunity to look to them with mercy follow your good intentions with them. But if not leave them be in peace."
  4,90,"They long that you should disbelieve as they disbelieve so then you would be equal; therefore do not take friends from among them until they emigrate in the way of God; then if they turn away take them and slay them wherever you find them; and do not take any of them as a patron or as a helper.

  4,91,"You will find others desiring to have security from you and security from their own people; yet whenever they are returned to sedition they are overwhelmed by it. So if they do not stay away from you and offer you peace and restrain their hands then take them and slay them wherever you come upon them; against them We have given you clear warrant. The effort of anyone who desires to combine two opposing things is ruined and his resolve does not grow. Just as an individual cannot be both a hypo- crite and one who wholeheartedly submits muslim no individual can be desirous of the Real and remain with the precepts of the people of habit. Spiritual desire irāda and habit ʿāda are opposites. It is necessary to abandon contradictory stances and to distance yourself from that which has no relation to you."
