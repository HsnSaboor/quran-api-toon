tafsir[7]{c,v,t}:
  3,133,"And vie with one another hastening to forgiveness from your Lord and to a garden as wide as the heavens and the earth that has been prepared for those who fear. Who expend in prosperity and adversity and restrain their rage and pardon their fellow men; and God loves those who are virtuous. The meaning here is vie with one another hastening to act in ways that will bring about forgiveness for you. The hearts [of the believers] were overwhelmed imagining that this was a difficult matter so [the Prophet] ﷺ said �Remorse is repentance� al-nadmu tawba. Nothing but repentance brings about forgiveness because the one who disobeys is the one who is in need of it. The people who vie with one another are of several types. Those who are worshipers ʿābidūn vie with one another by their feet in acts of obedience bi-qadamihim fī l-Ṭāʿāt. Those who have deeper knowledge ʿārifūn vie with one another with their aspirations in acts of drawing near bi-himam- ihim fī l-qurubāt. Those who are disobedient ʿāṣūn vie with one another with their remorse by swallowing their grief bi-nadamihim bi-tajarruʿi al-ḥasarāt. Whoever vies with others by his feet finds [God's] recompense wajada mathwabatahu. Whoever vies with others with his aspirations finds [God's] nearness wajada qurbatahu. Whoever vies with others with his remorse finds [God's] mercy wajada raḥmatahu. When He mentioned the garden He described it by the vastness of its width and in that there is information about its height because the height is comparable to the width. But when He mentioned forgiveness he did not mention height or width so some people have said that forgiveness is from the [divine] attributes of the essence ṣifāt al-dhāt and is part of the meaning of mercy raḥma. According to this way of thinking His forgiveness is His decree ḥukm in overlooking [the misdeeds of] the servant and His speech kalām. The quality of the essence is too holy for size and width. [On the other hand] those who say His forgiveness belongs with the [divine] attributes of actions ṣifāt al-fiʿl say that because of the abundance of sins He did not describe forgiveness as having any end thus indicating that it encompasses all sins. Who expend in prosperity and adversity: They do not hoard anything from God and prefer Him over everything."
  3,135,"And who when they commit an indecency or wrong themselves remem- ber God and pray forgiveness for their sins-and who shall forgive sins but Godḍ-and who do not persist in what they did knowing. Those-their requital is forgiveness from their Lord and gardens beneath which rivers flow abiding therein; excellent is the wage of those workers! God most high revealed to Moses ���� ������ �say to those who do wrong 'Until such time as they do not remember Me I have obliged Myself to remember those who remember Me and My remembrance of those who do wrong is the curse.'� But He said to those who do wrong in this community [when] they wrong themselves remember God and then says in the last part of the verse: and who shall forgive sins but Godḍ It is said that one's indecency fāḥisha is according to one's state ḥāl and station maqām as is true of one's wrongdoing ẓulm. The transgres- sions mukhālafāt that occur in the minds of the most respected people are like the actions of others. Their speaker said: You are my eye. Is it not right for my eye to lower its eyelids against the dust in the airḍ The crime on the carpet is not like the sin at the door. It is said that they commit an indecency by relying on their [own] actions or they wrong themselves by regarding their [own] states so they seek forgiveness for their sins by declaring themselves free from what they do and do not do knowing that there are no means to Him except through Him. He has purified them of the wrongdoings of their bodily and lower selves. Looking to states and actions when realities appear is wrongdoing. One whom God has purified by the light of solicitude is protected from entanglement in the delusions of people. Those-their requital is forgiveness from their Lord in returning them to witnessing the Lordship and the best possible outcome and fate that was already theirs. And gardens beneath which rivers flow in the future in paradise and in the here and now in the happiness of whispered conversations and the fullness of intimacy."

  3,137,"Ways of life have passed away before you; so travel in the land and behold how was the end of those who denied. This is an exposition for mankind and a guidance and an admonition for such as are God-fearing. It means �Take heed from those who came before. Consider how We acted with those who showed friendship and how We took revenge on those who showed enmity.� This is an exposition for mankind: an exposition to some people through rational proofs adillat al-ʿuqūl to others through unveilings of hearts mukāshafāt al-qulūb and to others through the self-disclosure of the Real in the innermost selves tajallī l-ḥaqq fī l-asrār."

  3,139,"Faint not neither grieve for you shall prevail if you are believers. [This] means when you support or launch an attack by means of [the help of] God you should not be afraid of anything other than God. Nor should you faint or become weak for surely help is from God and the One who prevails is God. Nothing is equal to God. Not even an atom or a particle [originates] from them. His words if you are believers that is it is not right that the believer should be overshadowed by fear of anything other than God."
  3,140,"If a wound touches you a like wound already has touched the other people. Such days We deal out in turn among mankind and that God may know those who believe; and that He may take witnesses from among you and God loves not the evildoers. �If a difficulty has come to you for Our sake they have faced something similar before you. They have been given something like what you have been given.� Those who are patient among them will be victorious fa-man ṣabara minhum ẓafira while those who suffer what comes with annoyance and anger will lose wa man Ḍajira min ḥamli ma laqiya khasira. Days come in turns al-ayām nuwabun and circumstances change wa-l-ḥālāt duwalun and nothing is hidden from the Real."
