tafsir[4]{c,v,t}:
  3,149,"O you who believe if you obey the disbelievers they will make you turn back on your heels and you will revert as losers. Nay but God is your protector and He is the best of helpers. [This] means that if you obey the adversaries they will pull you into their states and cast you into their darknesses. Nay God is your protector your helper the One who aids you Your Master and the One who sets your affairs aright. And He is the best of helpers because He aids you against your lower selves and protects you from their evil. Anyone other than Him adds to your afflictions when they help you because they aid your lower selves against you. And He is the best of helpers because anyone other than Him holds a favor over you in helping you while He rewards you for your asking for His help. It is said that when you ask someone for help you need to give him something of value and then he may or may not help you. But when you ask [God] ������ for help He gives you every kindness and takes no pleasure in not helping you."

  3,151,"We will cast terror into the hearts of the disbelievers; for that they have associated with God that for which He sent down no authority; their abode shall be the fire; evil is the abode of the evildoers. God ������ designated our Prophet ﷺ to cast terror ruʿb from Him into the hearts of His enemies. [The Prophet] ���� ������ said: �I was helped by terror ruʿb.� He also follows this way sunna with His friends. He puts fear hayba of them into hearts. Fear hayba and force qahr would hardly be right in hearts were it not from Him and used with those who follow falsehood make false claims and misrepresent [the truth]."
  3,153,"When you were ascending not turning around for anyone and the Messenger was calling you from your rear so he rewarded you with grief for grief so that you might not grieve for what escaped you neither for what befell you; and God is aware of what you do. Then He sent down upon you after grief security-a slumber overcom- ing a party of you and a party whose own souls distressed them thinking wrongly of God thoughts of the age of ignorance saying �Have we any part whatever in the affairḍ� Say: �The affair belongs entirely to God.� They conceal within their hearts what they do not disclose to you saying �Had we had any part in the affair we would not have been slain here.� Say: �Even if you had been in your houses those for whom it had been appointed that they be slain would have sallied forth to the places where they were to lie� that God might try what was in your breasts and that He might prove what was in your hearts; and God knows what is in the breasts. The verse alludes to people for whom a period of slackening fatra occurs. The calls of the Real ������ come from within and without so that it is as if the rocks in the streets and the bricks in the walls were crying out to such a one �do not do it O servant of God!� But he is resolved upon his crooked way layy and settled in his error ghayy; [he] refuses to acknowledge what he knows would be more fitting and appropriate for his state. If he were to stay with his [original] aim and follow through with his aspiration by all means he would rein himself in and hold himself back from galloping ahead. [But] he gets nothing but gasping breaths anfās mutaṣāʿida and continuous sorrows ḥasarāt mutawātira-the Real ������ has bequeathed him one lonely estrangement after another. Eventually after he has been in this place of distress for a long time the Real ������ will relieve him with His beautiful kindness and draw him near with His gracious affection. He will deliver him from the narrowness of his captivity to the spaciousness of His pardon and favor. Many of these [people] will reach the place of the most respected and thereupon become still by God for God when they have been negated from station and honor and they will stand by God for God without waiting to be brought near and without looking to be welcomed."
