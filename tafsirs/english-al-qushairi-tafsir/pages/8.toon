tafsir[6]{c,v,t}:
  2,49,"And when We delivered you from the folk of Pharaoh who were visiting you with evil chastisement slaughtering your sons and sparing your women; and for you therein was a tremendous trial from your Lord. Whoever has patience in God with the affliction of His enemies aʿdāÌihi God will compensate him with the companionship of His friends awliyāÌihi and He will grant him His beautiful gift ʿaṬāÌihi. The children of Israel were patient in enduring injury from Pharaoh and his people so He appointed prophets from among them and made them kings. He gave them what He had not given anyone in all the worlds. And for you therein was a tremendous trial from your Lord: It is said that [it was] a great blessing niʿmatun ʿaẓīma and a severe trial miḥnatun shadīda. In truth what [came] from God was externally a trial miḥna but it was really for the one who recognized it a blessing niʿma and a kindness minna."
  2,50,"When We divided for you the sea and We delivered you and drowned Pharaoh's folk while you were beholding. The perceptive faculties baṣāÌir of the children of Israel had become diminished so He showed them miracles openly ʿayānan whereas the perceptive faculties of this community [Muslims] were sharp so He unveiled His signs to them secretly sirran. This is His ������ way sunna. For those who are sharper in the perceptive faculty the matter will be more subtle for them and the allusions within it more abundant. [The Prophet] ﷺ said �I was given the all-comprehensive words jawāmiʿ al-kalim and then the speech kalām was shortened for me.� When [the children of Israel] saw these manifest signs in the splitting of the sea and the drowning of the people of Pharaoh they were seized with doubt and said �They did not drown even though they were cast into the sea� but the children of Israel did see them drowning. On the other hand in this community because of their being foremost in their belief in the Messenger of God ﷺ and because of the power of their perceptive faculties one youth said �It is as if I was with the people of the garden exchanging visits and as if I was with the people of the fire clamoring to one another and as if I saw the throne of my Lord in plain sight.� What a difference [there is] between one who sees with his own eyes yet doubts and one who only hears [about something] and yet sees it like an eyewitness because of the power of his belief!"
  2,51,"And when We appointed for Moses forty nights then you took to your- selves the calf after him and you were evildoers. What a difference [there is] between one community and another! When Moses ���� ������ withdrew from the community for forty days they took the calf as their object of worship and were pleased with that. They said This is your God and the God of Moses but he has forgotten [20:88]. [On the other hand] the community of Muḥammad the Chosen ﷺ spent many years with their prophet. If they had heard anyone mention any form of [material] descrip- tion of what they worshiped they would not have spared their last breath and would have given their lives [before agreeing to such a comparison]. It is said that Moses ���� ������ entrusted his community to his brother saying Take my place with my people [7:142]. When he returned he found that they had fallen into temptation fitna. Our Prophet ﷺ relied on God and did not suggest anyone to lead the community. At the end of his life he said �the highest companions.� See how the Real attended to the care of [Muḥammad's] community in preserving their monotheism. By my life they may forfeit their [territorial] borders but they will not compromise their declaration of God's unity tawḥīd."
  2,52,"Then We pardoned you after that so that you might be thankful. The quickness [with which God] pardoned such a grave sin indicates the lesser weight of those who were pardoned. The words of God most high testify to that [in addressing the wives of the Prophet] Whoever of you commits manifest indecency the chastisement shall be doubled for her [33:30]. The children of Israel worshiped the calf so God most high said �Then We pardoned you after that.� To the community [of Muḥammad ﷺ] He said �and whoever does an atom's weight of evil shall see it� [99:8]."
  2,55,"And when you said �O Moses we will not believe you till we see God openly�; and the thunderbolt took you while you were beholding. Demanding to see the Essence without divine blessing is an open act of sacrilege which is one of the signs of distance and misery whereas attest- ing to the attribute of [divine] governance in the unveilings of might as linked to the kindnesses of nearness is one of the marks of communion and the tokens of felicity. Surely when they spoke from ignorance without any sense whatsoever of shame the convulsion and the thunderbolt blast overtook them."
  2,56,"Then We raised you up after you were dead so that you might be thankful. He returned them to consciousness after the blows of punishment over- whelmed them in order to fulfill the decree for them and to implement [God's] way of pardoning sin. One of the aspects of generosity is to lower the veil over the defects of servants."
