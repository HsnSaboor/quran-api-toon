tafsir[4]{c,v,t}:
  3,16,"Those who say: �O Our Lord we believe; so forgive us our sins and guard us from the chastisement of the fire� that is �they occupy themselves with Us entirely bi-l-kulliya and plead for help before Us at the mention of severe trials and afflictions al-raziyya. Those obtain nearness and intimate friendship al-qurba wa-l-khuṣūṣiyya with Us high degrees wa-l-darajāt al-ʿuliyya and pleasing fates wa-l- qisam al-murḌiyya.�"
  3,20,"So if they dispute with you say: �I have surrendered my countenance to God and whoever follows me�: and say to those who have been given the scripture and to the uninstructed: �Have you submittedḍ� And so if they have submitted they have been guided but if they turn their backs your duty is only to deliver; and God sees His servants. �Look at them through the eye of [God's] free disposal taṣrīf so that your state does not become unsettled at the differences and the disparity of their stages. One who looks at created beings through the eye of [God's] delib- erative power qudra knows that the One who determines for all based on what He has chosen for each is One. Call them publicly when in public and bear witness privately to Our free disposal taṣrīf with regard to them when in private.� Occupy your tongue by counseling them but empty your heart of their talk and separate your innermost self from witnessing them for We have not charged you with their affairs [but only] with deliver[ing] [the message]. The One who brings about affairs and originates is Us.�"
  3,21,"Those who disbelieve in the signs of God and slay the prophets without right and slay those who enjoin to equity. So give them good tidings of a painful chastisement. �Those whom We have bound to disappointment khidhlān and branded with the state of deprivation ḥirmān-tell them that Our turning away from them is perpetual and that We have already determined their transference from one abode of disgrace hawān to another from disap- pointment khidhlān and deprivation ḥirmān to punishment and fires nīrān.�"
  3,22,"Those are the ones whose works have failed in this world and the here- after; they have no helpers. Those are the ones for whom no success is granted in their works tawfīq bi-aʿmāl today nor realization of their hopes taḥqīq li-āmāl tomorrow. That is only because they have lost Our help in both abodes and did not bear witness to Our might and power."
