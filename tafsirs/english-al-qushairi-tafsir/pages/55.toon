tafsir[6]{c,v,t}:
  3,38,"Then Zachariah prayed to his Lord saying �Lord bestow upon me from You a goodly offspring verily You are the Hearer of supplication.� That is when he saw the special gift karāma of God ������ with her he grew increasingly certain and ever more hopeful so he asked for a son in spite of his advanced age. The granting of his request was a rupture of ordinary reality naqḌ al-ʿāda. It is said that Zachariah ���� ������ asked for a son to help him in obedience and an heir from his progeny in prophethood so that he might uphold the right of God ḥaqq Allāh. So it was a request which deserved to be granted. When a request is for the right of the Real ḥaqq al-ḥaqq and not for the worldly concerns of the lower self ḥaẓẓ al-nafs He will not refuse it. Zachariah ���� ������ saw Mary with summer fruits in the winter and winter fruits in the summer so he asked for a son in his old age so that it might be a sign āya and a miracle muʿjiza."
  3,39,"And the angels called to him as he stood praying in the sanctuary at worship When the petitioner asks and remains at the door the request is granted to him. This alludes to the fact that anyone who needs something from kings should remain at the door until the request is granted. It is said that the ruling of God ������ is such that He only responds to the request of those who embrace service khidma to Him and He casts those who turn away from obedience into the lowliness of estrangement. \t that �God gives you good tidings of John who shall confirm a word from God; a lord and one chaste and a prophet of the righteous.� It is said that he named him John Yaḥyā because of the life ḥayāt of his heart through God. Exegetical writings tell us that the barrenness of his mother was brought to life ḥayy through him. It is said that [the name means] the quickening of life in the heart of one who believes in Him. His saying who shall confirm a word from God Allāh means his con- firmation of the word Allāh by which he worshiped Him or that he was brought into being by the word of God. His saying a lord: The lord is one who is not in bondage to any created thing. He has been freed taḥarrara from captivity to whims and from [captivity to] any created thing. It is said that the lord is someone who has actualized his servanthood ʿubūdiyya to [God] ������. It is said that the lord is the one who is superior to the people of his age and John was such. It is said lord because he did not seek any station for himself nor did he view himself as having any worth. When he dedicated himself in humility to God in every way [God] caused him to rise above the group and made him a lord to all. His saying and one chaste that is liberated from passions and spared from carnal human properties despite being human. It is said that [it means] being protected from the demands of his lower self restrained from that through [his] engagement in exaltation [of God] and seeking to draw near [to Him]. It is said his restraint came from being uprooted by the intuitions of realities coming to him such that he no longer had any preference for worldly things. And a prophet of the righteous that is he was worthy of attaining their rank."
  3,40,"He said �My Lord! How shall I have a boy when old age has overtaken me and my wife is barrenḍ� He said 'so it will be.� �God does what He will.� It is said that there was a long time between his petition and the reply and because of that he said �How shall I have a boyḍ� It may mean that he said �By what right would I receive a response [to my prayer] if not by Your favorḍ�93 It may mean that he said �How shall this be: by adoption or sexual procreationḍ� It may mean that [he questioned] whether this was to be from a woman other than his wife since she was [also] of advanced age [that is] from taking a slave as a concubine. So it was said to him �No not through these means for both you and your wife have suffered loneliness together so the good news of the son is for both of you.�"
  3,42,"And when the angels said �O Mary God has preferred you and made you pure; He has preferred you above all women of the worlds.� It is possible that this was the beginning of a message from the angels to Mary elevating her state. It is possible that she may have heard their words and seen them or that she did not see them but heard them as a voice call- ing out to her: �God has preferred you by your being favored and singled out from among your kind and peers and made you pure from what is indecent and sinful with a beautiful immunity and [pure] from having physical contact with men. He has preferred you above all women of the worlds in your time.� The point of repeating the mention of her being preferred is first �He has chosen you through special gifts position and an exalted state�; and second �He has chosen you to bear Jesus ���� ������ without a father and no woman can ever be compared to you until the Day of Resurrection.� Because of that He said �above all women of the worlds.�"
  3,43,"�O Mary be obedient to your Lord prostrating and bowing with those who bow.� �Persevere on the carpet of worship and practice obedience continually. Do not fall short from continuous service khidma. The Real has singled you out by your station so be without equal in your time in your worship of Him.�"
  3,44,"That is of the tidings of the unseen. We reveal it to you for you were not with them when they were casting quills which of them should have charge of Mary; nor were you with them when they were disputing. That is �We have told you [Muḥammad] of these stories and have spoken with you about their meanings. Although We have related these stories to you Our speech is rare and precious-it is more valuable and more perfect than if you yourself had been a witness to [these events].�"
