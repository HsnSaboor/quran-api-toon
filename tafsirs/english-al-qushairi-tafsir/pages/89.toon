  4,66,"And had We prescribed for them: �slay yourselves� or �Leave your habitations� they would not have done it save a few of them; yet if they had done what they were admonished to do it would have been better for them and a firmer position. And then We would have surely given them from Us a great wage. And We would have guided them to a straight path. [God] exposed the weakness of their sincerity akhbara ʿan suqmi ikhlāṣihim and the extent of their bankruptcy wa-quwwati iflāsihim and informed [the Prophet and the believers] of their failings by His knowl- edge. Although [God] let [the hypocrites] go their own way in many of the tests He said �If they had been inclined to serve and had put on the belt of obedience it would have been better for them than their persisting in their disbelief and pride. If they had done that We would have given them a great reward thawāb ʿaẓīm from Us and would have guided them on a straight path ṣirāṬ mustaqīm and rendered to them an enduring gift ʿaṬāÌ muqīm. In the explanation by allusion bayān al-ishāra this matter refers to opposing personal whims and sacrificing the lower selves by holding them back from familiar and comfortable things. It is leaving [your] habitations and parting from the familiar territories of desire for the present world."

  4,70,"Whoever obeys God and the Messenger they are with those whom God has blessed of the prophets and the truthful and the martyrs and the righteous. What fine companions they are! That is bounty from God. God suffices as Knower. He made obedience to the Chosen One al-MuṣṬafā ﷺ72 the key to attain- ing the stations of the prophets the truthful and the martyrs in a manner that is suitable for the community and appropriate for the high rank of [the Prophet] ���� ������. That is bounty from God: He detached their situation from every cause merit and reason for surely what comes to them and what happens to them is the disbursement of His bounty and originates from His generosity."
  4,71,"O you who believe take your precautions then move forward in com- panies or move forward all together. Verily there are some of you who tarry; then if an affliction befalls you he says �God has been gracious to me for I was not a witness with them.� But if a bounty from God befalls you he will surely cry as if there had never been any affection between you and him: �Oh would that I had been with them so that I might have won a great triumph!� Fleeing toward firār ilā God is among the attributes of those who seek qāṣidūn. Fleeing with firār maʿa God is among the attributes of those who arrive wāṣilūn. Rest qarār with God cannot be found except by those who are sincere in fleeing to God. Fleeing from everything other [than God] is the concern of anyone who declares His unity. Verily there are some of you who tarry... that is their beliefs are not firmly established in one state. They are tied to worldly concerns so when they see something unpleasant approaching the Muslims they are grateful and say �Praise be to God who has protected us from following them and afflicting us with what He has afflicted them.� But if you have a blessing or something good they incline toward you and wish that they had been with you. They have lost in the present world and the hereafter. They are not completely73 disbelievers nor are they loyal believers. As if there had never been any affection between you and him: It means they had already dropped the commitment to protect and defend your lives property and honor."

  4,74,"So let them fight in the way of God those who sell the life of this world for the hereafter; and whoever fights in the way of God and is slain or conquers We shall give him a great wage. The struggle jihād of someone who has not slain the lower self in himself is not sound. The removal of the fear of death from the heart comes first and then the surrender of the lower self to it. We shall give him a great wage means �Our remaining after him is better for him than his life through his lower self.� Their speaker said: Are you not my compensation for myselfḍ That is honor enough. Besides you I have no goal nor anything to request."
