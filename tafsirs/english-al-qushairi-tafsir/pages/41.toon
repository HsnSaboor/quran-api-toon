tafsir[4]{c,v,t}:
  2,249,"And when Saul went forth with the hosts he said �God will try you with a river; whoever drinks of it is not of me and whoever tastes it not he is of me except for him who scoops up with his hand. The allusion in this verse is that God ������ tests human beings in their association with others with this world and with the lower self. There are some whose association with these things is limited to that which is required for [them to earn a] basic livelihood and what is necessary for their salvation and security. There are others who go beyond the limit of what is required and extend their association with things of the world self and creation for the sake of carnal desire and their own preference. There is nothing from God in that which involves doing a prohibited thing. There is nothing from this path Ṭarīqa in that which involves holding on to more than what is needed. But they drank of it except a few of them; Likewise the elect in every moment are few in their number but sublime in their worth. and when he crossed it with those who believed they said �We have no power today against Goliath and his troops.� They viewed the situation with the eye of the external world and were overcome with mortal fright. God fortified their hearts telling them that the Real ������ helps His friends if He wills it. Those who thought they would meet God said �How often a small company has overcome a numerous one by God's leave; and God is with the patient.� [The victory is] not by them but by the permission of God through what He has willed and through His aid and His help. God is with the patient through help support and strength."
  2,250,"So when they went forth against Goliath and his troops they said �Our Lord pour out upon us patience and make firm our feet and grant us victory over the disbelieving folk!� So when they went forth against Goliath and his troops [the hosts of Saul] exonerated themselves of all power and strength and turned to God seek- ing His succor asking for His aid and trusting in His help. They said �Our Lord pour out upon us patience and make firm our feet. First they sought firmness and patience for the sake of the sufferings they had previously endured and then they said �and grant us victory over the disbelieving folk!� The most important of their concerns was patience and standing up to the enemy and only after that [were they concerned for] help for themselves. Patience [in enduring sufferings] is the right of the Real ḥaqq al-ḥaqq while help is their portion. They stepped forward to assert His right ������ and to succeed for His sake and then to find their worldly portion from [His] help. Moreover [the hosts of Saul] indicated that they were seeking help against [the enemy] not out of revenge for what had been taken from them but because they [the enemy] were disbelievers enemies of God. The [hosts of Saul] stood in every way for God through God. Because of that they were helped and found victory."
  2,251,"And they routed them by the leave of God and David slew Goliath; and God gave him the kingship and wisdom and He taught him such as He willed. God frightened the enemies with Saul whom He had given such a large body. But at the time of the fighting He brought the victory about through the hands of David. As the story goes [David] was of middling stature not large in body a compact person. He had no weapon with him but a slingshot; the victory was his because the help of God ������ was with him. And they routed them by the leave of God so that nothing not even a trace remained of them. David killed Goliath. Because of Goliath's bulk and size David's victory over him was unimaginable but as the one who spoke for them said: He met me with his sword drawn and said to me One of us is gone. Had God not repelled people some by means of others the earth would have surely been corrupted; but God is bounteous to all worlds. If mankind were to make common cause and agree with one another alto- gether the weak would be destroyed by the victory of the strong. But He keeps some occupied by others so as to deflect their evil from other people."
  2,252,"These are the verses of God We recite to you in truth and assuredly you are one of the Messengers [of God]. �You did not have knowledge [O Muḥammad] regarding these long ago beings from the past nor was this something you devised. Rather you came to know of them through information given by God ������.�"
