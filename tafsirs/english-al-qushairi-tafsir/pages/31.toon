tafsir[5]{c,v,t}:
  2,197,"The pilgrimage is in months well-known; The pilgrimage for the bodily selves nufūs is in months well-known. The iḥrām is only binding in it and it is not possible to undertake the pilgrimage during the rest of the year rather [it is] only in a specific time period. One for whom that time has passed the pilgrimage has passed him. Likewise the pilgrimage of the hearts has times [that are] well-known and [it] is only appropriate during them. These are the days of youth for one who has no spiritual desire irāda in his youth has no communion in the state of his old age. Likewise the one for whom the time of his quest qaṣd and spiritual desire irāda has passed only the worship whose outcome is the garden is appropriate not the spiritual desire irāda whose outcome is communion. whoever undertakes the duty of pilgrimage during them then no lewdness nor wickedness or disputing in the pilgrimage. The allusion is also to whoever travels the path of spiritual desire that he should not stop at anything in the path nor mix his spiritual desire with anything. Whoever argues opposes or is rude with him-he yields to them all. He does not dispute with anyone for the sake of this world nor does he compete with anyone for some worldly fortune for the self or honor. God most high said �And when the ignorant address them they say 'peace'� [25:63]. Whatever good you do God knows it. You should be content with His knowledge and His judgment rather than being seen judged or known by His creatures. And take provision. But the best provision is piety; and fear Me O people of pith! The piety of ordinary people is the avoidance of errors while the piety of the elect is the avoidance of anything other [than God] in the inner secrets of their hearts."
  2,198,"You would not be at fault if you should seek bounty from your Lord; [Here] the allusion is that whatever you seek from the bounty of God-from what has been determined for you according to His rightful decree-is praiseworthy if it has a portion for the Muslims or the strength of the religion dīn. Whatever you seek solely for your worldly fortune or for what benefits you is flawed. but when you press on from ʿArafāt then remember God at the sacred waymark; and remember Him as He has guided you though previously you were astray. [Here] the allusion is to when you have gone so far as to perform what He has requested [you should] remember His favor with you for if He had not desired you you would not have desired Him. If He had not chosen you you would not have preferred His good pleasure."
  2,199,"Then press on from where the people press on and seek God's forgive- ness; God is Forgiving Merciful. The allusion [in this part of the verse] is that you should not see yourself as different from others because of some manner of dressing patched clothing or some quality that distinguishes you outwardly. Rather you should [consider yourself only as] one among [all] humanity. When the thought comes to you that you have done something or that anything [happens] through you for you or with you seek God's forgiveness and renew your faith for [this kind of thought] is a hidden idolatry shirk that infects your heart."
  2,200,"And when you have performed your holy rites remember God as you remember your fathers or yet more intensely. And when you have performed your holy rites is an allusion to carrying out the rightful due ḥaqq of servanthood ʿubūdiyya. Remember God as you remember your fathers is an allusion to carrying out the rightful due ḥaqq of love maḥabba. The performance of the holy rites is an undertaking through the self nafs. Remember God as you remember your fathers is an undertaking for His sake through the heart qalb continuously in the moment and throughout one's life. It is said that �Just as others boast of their fathers and delight in their ancestors let your boasting and delight be in Us.� It is said that �If your fathers have a right to raise and educate you Our right over you is even more binding since Our favors to you are more perfect.� It is said �Your ancestors may have glorious deeds and virtues but Our worthiness from the attributes of sublimity jalāl is far beyond anything due to your ancestors from the best of their states.� It is said that �If you never grow weary of remembering your father and you rarely forget him then remember Us continually and do not let weariness boredom or forgetfulness stop you.� It is said that �If someone speaks ill of your lineage you are not pleased. Similarly do not listen to the words of those who err and contrive but rather defend Us.� It is said that �The father is remembered with respect and deference. Similarly remember Us with awe even as you [also] remember the kind- ness of nearness and the best of caring.� He said �Remember God as you remember your fathers� but did not say �your mothers� because the father is remembered out of respect and the mother is remembered out of com- passion for her. God shows mercy-He is not the recipient of it. Or yet more intensely because the Real ḥaqq is more deserving aḥaqq. You might be much estranged from your father while the Real ������ is free from any thought coming to those who have knowledge of Him that they would oppose what has been made obligatory in even the smallest way. As you remember your fathers the father according to his rightful due and the Lord according to His rightful due."
  2,202,"Those-they shall have a portion from what they have earned; If [what they have earned] was good then a good [portion]. If it was something else then something else. and God is swift at reckoning [The reckoning occurs] for ordinary people at [the Day of Judgment] and for the elect at every breath. It is said that He mentioned two groups: those who say �Our Lord give to us in this world� and those who say �Give to us in this world and the next.� The third group which is not mentioned are those who are content with His decree those who submit to His command those who forgo every supplication and request."
