tafsir[6]{c,v,t}:
  2,275,"Those who devour usury shall not rise again except as one whom Satan has made prostrate from touch; that is because they say �Trade is like usury�: God has permitted trade and forbidden usury. Whoever receives an admonition from his Lord and desists he shall have his past gains and his affair is committed to God; but whoever reverts-those are the inhabitants of the fire abiding therein. Those who turn away from the command giving themselves license from their own interpretation taÌwīl have neither secure independence in the present moment lā istiqlālun lahum fī l-ḥāl nor recovery in the end wa- lā intiʿāshun fī l-maÌāl. They lose in their current life khasirū fī ʿājilihim and have no profit in their future wa-lam yarbaḥū fī ājilihim. Those who heed the calls of admonition curb the bridle of their whims and do not give free rein to persist [in prohibited actions] are granted respite for the present. However if they return to these blameworthy states let them wait for the swiftest uprooting and sudden chastisement."
  2,276,"God effaces usury but He augments voluntary almsgivings with inter- est. God loves not any guilty ingrate. The behaviors He has permitted are connected to good things fa-maqrūnun bi-l-khayrāt and are accompanied by blessings wa-maṣḥūbun bi-l-barakāt while [behaviors] that arise from [personal] whims come to naught-loss is the end of the affair of one [who follows his own whims]."
  2,278,"O you who believe fear God and give up the usury that is outstand- ing if you are believers. Being content with what is promised mawʿūd by the Lord is better for the one who submits than attaching one's heart to what the lower self seeks maqṣūd. What you seek maqṣūd is from the deceptions of the lower self while what you are promised mawʿūd is guaranteed by the Real."
  2,279,"But if you do not then be warned of war from God and His Messenger. Yet if you repent you shall have your principal sums not being unjust and no injustice being done to you. Those who willfully persist have no weight or measure miqdār before Us no standing or degree of dignity akhṬār."
  2,280,"And if any man should be in difficulty then [let there be] respite till things are easier; but that you should give a voluntary almsgiving is better for you did you but know. When the insolvency of a detained man is determined before the judge it is not permissible to continue his detention. If the proof of the man's insolvency is demonstrated that [proof] is taken in security for what is due his adversary. But he is in a period of respite and delay. In that the Lord does not judge us but with His knowledge of our difficulties and weakness and the sincerity of our need for Him and our dedication to Him He is merciful with us. His words �till things are easier� [relate to] the poor insolvent man [who] has no way to obtain anything for himself except through what God ������ appoints for him as the portion of debtors. Income accrues to those who have the goods and the contract. What does the insolvent [per- son] have to do with itḍ What does the insolvent [person] have to do with profit in trade from the transformation of capital and what is done with itḍ What is left for the insolvent [person]ḍ The jurists say he must seek work if he is healthy. If he is weak then this [statement that he must seek work] applies only if he has enough physical strength. As for those who are bankrupt in vigor just as one is bankrupt in wealth what way remains for him except what his Protector appoints for himḍ"
  2,281,"And fear a day wherein you shall be returned to God and every soul shall be paid in full what it has earned; and they shall not be wronged. There are two kinds of return: [a return] for the bodily and lower selves in the future at the time of death and [a return] for the innermost selves and hearts at every breath. [The latter is] a reckoning-a payment in ready cash versus a promise [regarding the future]. The payment in ready cash for His claim [at every breath] is more fitting than what will come at the resurrection by His promise. He said to ordinary people �And fear a day� and He said to the elect �and fear Me� [2:41]."
