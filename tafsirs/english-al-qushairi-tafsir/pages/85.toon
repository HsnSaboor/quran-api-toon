tafsir[6]{c,v,t}:
  4,38,"And those who expend of their substance to show off to people and believe not in God and the Last Day. Whoever has Satan for a comrade then an evil comrade has he. These are also included in His words �surely God loves not the conceited and the boastful fakhūr� [4:36]. Their immediate punishment is that they are not in the group of those whom He loves. That is tribulation enough. The conceited are those who look to themselves while those who show off look to others like them. Both of them are branded by hidden idolatry shirk khafī and God does not love those who associate others with Him. Among camels the fakhūr is a she-camel in the flock whose teats are blocked so that a large amount of milk collects in the udder. The buyer thinks that that is normal for her but it is not so. Likewise anyone who looks only to himself and his standing in the present moment is making false claims-he is fakhūr and God does not love him. This is also the case for the one who expends his substance to show off to people."
  4,39,"And what burden is on them if they were to believe in God and the Last Day and expend of what God has provided themḍ God is ever Aware of them. There is no difficulty for them in putting their faith and trust in God. Indeed if they were to have faith they would attain glorious honor in this world and the hereafter. Nothing prompts them to turn away from [God] but their lack of commitment and respect."
  4,40,"Surely God shall not wrong so much as the weight of an atom; and if it be a good deed He will double it and give from Himself a great wage. He does not deprive them of anything in their reward but rather is first with his bounty for them without their having deserved [it] and He doubles the wages for their works. It is impossible to describe what [God] has decreed as wrongdoing because the creation is His creation and the kingdom is His kingdom. The wrongdoer is one who transgresses a limit which has been ordained for him-it is impossible to describe the glory of [God's] sublime measure in this way."
  4,41,"So how shall it be when We bring forward from every community a witness; and We bring you as witness against theseḍ Upon that day the disbelievers those who have disobeyed the Messenger will wish that the earth might be leveled with them. And they will not hide from God any talk. Since the Messenger ﷺ will be the witness against his community as well as their intercessor he will only bear witness to that which can be the object of [his] intercession. Upon that day the disbelievers... They will become remorseful but it will not benefit them. They will bite their fingertips but their anguish will not subside. They will be wrapped in the veil of ignominy and transferred to the homesteads of tribulation and adversity."

  4,44,"Have you not seen those who were given a share of the Book purchas- ing error and desiring that you should err from the wayḍ God has better knowledge of your enemies. God suffices as a Protector God suffices as a Helper. Some from among the Jews distort the words from their contexts and they say �We have heard and we disobey and hear as one who does not hear� and �Mind us� twisting with their tongues and slandering religion. If they had said �We have heard and obey� and �Hear� and �Consider us� it would have been better for them and more upright but God has cursed them for their unbelief so they believe not except a few. They practiced a deception but did not realize the way in which He deceived them in that they were given the book and then were deprived of the bless- ing of understanding so that they distorted [the words] and persisted [in their unbelief]. Some from among the Jews distort the words... They acted shamelessly toward the Messenger ﷺ and refused to show him respect so they were punished with doubt concerning his affair. Those who acted shamelessly devised a barrier between themselves and the blessing of [the Prophet's] companionship and the bounties of serving him. If they had hastened [instead] to reject the envy they felt and had accepted his state with venera- tion and honored [him] they would have found blessing in following him and happiness in both abodes. But how could they be otherwise when what had already been determined distanced themḍ They were kept back by fate qisma from the carpet of service khidma. There is no maneuvering that can help those held back by the [divine] decrees."
