tafsir[7]{c,v,t}:
  3,53,"Lord we believe in what You have revealed and we follow the Messenger; write us down therefore with those who bear witness. As for the remainder they worked to create dissension and intensified their enmity. They plotted and schemed against him but God made them taste the evil of their scheming. They imagined that they had crucified and killed Jesus ���� ������ but that was from their ignorance and confusion. God ������ raised Jesus ���� ������ as His prophet nabī and His friend walī. Banishment and cursing was the rightful due of his enemies-this was [God's] schem- ing with them. And they schemed; and God schemed; and God is the best of schemers."
  3,55,"When God said �O Jesus I am gathering you and raising you to Me and I am cleansing you of those who disbelieved The allusion in it: �I am gathering you from yourself seizing you from yourself raising you above the mortal human attributes and purifying you from your own desire irāda completely so that you will act as Our agent muṣarrif through Us and for Us. You will have no free choice ikhtiyār in anything. In its place divine governorship tawallī will descend upon you and stand in for you.� By this quality the dead were brought to life through the hands [of Jesus]. These were occurrences that could only happen by the divine deliberative power may it be exalted. It is said that He purified his heart from looking to others aghyār and from seeing simulacra and traces al-amthāl wa-l-āthār in all states and phases al-aḥwāl wa-l-aṬwār. and I am setting those who follow you above those who disbelieved until the Day of Resurrection In help nuṣra force qahr and proof ḥujja. His followers-those who have not changed his religion dīn and those who follow his creed ʿaqīda in the declaration of oneness tawḥīd-are believers muÌminūn. They are in the right until the Day of Resurrection and they will be helped [by God] until the Day of Resurrection. Then God ������ will judge between them and their enemies on that day. The disbelievers will be in hellfire ammā l-kuffār fa-fī l-jaḥīm and the believers will be in felicity wa-ammā l-muÌminūn fa-fī l-naʿīm. Then to Me shall be your return and I will decide between you as to what you were at variance about."
  3,56,"As for the disbelievers I will chastise them with a terrible chastisement in this world and the hereafter; they shall have no helpers. But as for the believers who do deeds of righteousness He will pay them in full their wages. God loves not the evildoers. This We recite to you of verses and wise remembrance. �This We recite to you O Muḥammad to inform you of the meanings of what We have revealed to you. [These meanings do not reach you] through your exertion to attain knowledge nor by your learning from parables nor by your deduction by any sort of reasoning.�"

  3,59,"Truly the likeness of Jesus in God's sight is as Adam's likeness. He chose to purify the spirit rūḥ in them from the act of passing from one body to another tanāsukh in the loins but He singled out Adam as the first [of men] while He singled out Jesus ���� ������ for the special distinc- tion of breathing the spirit into him in the most exalted way. But even though these two were weighty beings the imperfection of being in time and being mortal was nonetheless unavoidable for them: He created him of dust then He said to him �Be� and he was [3:59]."
  3,61,"And whoever disputes with you concerning him after the knowledge that has come to you say: �Come! Let us call our sons and your sons our wives and your wives our selves and your selves then let us humbly pray and invoke God's curse upon those who lie.� And whoever disputes with you concerning him means that �After you have sincerely proclaimed what you were told and have come to know the truth of the knowledge We imparted to you in your heart do not be reticent in challenging them to mutual cursing. Trust that you have the force qahr and help nuṣra and that We are protecting you and have sheltered you in the wing of Our nearness.� If they had sought this mutual cursing the valley would have rained fire down upon them but God ������ gave them respite because He knew of the believers [yet to come] of their progeny. This verse alludes to those whose states are no longer those of the sincere ṣiddīqūn. When the lights [of the sincere] appear what remains in [the others] fades away completely."
