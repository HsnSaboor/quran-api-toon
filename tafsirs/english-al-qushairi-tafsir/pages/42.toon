  2,253,"Those messengers some We have preferred above others; there are some to whom God spoke and some He raised in rank. And We gave Jesus son of Mary the clear proofs and confirmed him with the Holy Spirit. In the message they were united but they differed in the specific details. Each one has lights and their lights have places where they are cast. Among them is one who is the most sublime in terms of light and most perfect in rank and intensity. Their virtues are not entitlements based on their actions and states but rather are a goodly decree that came to them ḥukmun bi-l- ḥusnā adrakahum and a beautiful succession that reached them in turns wa-ʿāqibatun bi-l-jamīli tadārakathum. And had God willed those who came after them would not have fought against one another after the clear proofs had come to them; but they fell into variance and some of them believed and some disbelieved and had God willed they would not have fought against one another but God does whatever He desires. They are made to turn about by the eternal will and have been stripped of free choice; [instead there is the divine choice] around which everything circles madār and by which is the crossing over iʿtibār. Servanthood is the tight- ening of the belt of service khidma and the witnessing of prior fate qisma."
  2,254,"O you who believe expend of what We have provided you with before there comes a day in which there shall be neither commerce nor friendship nor intercession. And the disbelievers-they are the evildoers. This means [one should] take advantage of the help [one is] granted-the ability to act virtuously-before [one's] strength flags and one's allotted time passes."
  2,256,"There is no compulsion in religion. The arguments are clear and the proofs plain and evident. Rectitude has become clear from error; The night is distinguished by its darkness from the day and its light. The eternal truths ḥuqūq [of the Real] are given facts while the basic limits ḥudūd [of created things] are subject to other causes. [The truths of the Real] are [known] through the property of timeless eternity naʿt al-qidam while [the limits of created things] are [known] through the attribute of privation waṣf al-ʿadam. so whoever disbelieves in the false deity The false deity is anything that distracts one from his Lord. and believes in God Belief is the life of the heart ḥayāt al-qalb through God. has laid hold of the most firm handle Laying hold of the most firm handle is holding to the command and pro- hibition al-amr wa-l-nahy which is traveling the path of al-MuṣṬafā ﷺ. unbreaking; God is Hearing Knowing.
