tafsir[5]{c,v,t}:
  3,116,"As for the disbelievers their riches shall not avail them neither their children against God; those are the inhabitants of the fire abiding therein. There is no alternate for them in the situation no substitute for them in the final outcome. They are in a state of loss in the here and now and in the future will be in separation and exile affliction and hurt punishment and rejection: She changed and we changed. Alas to anyone who has sought but did not find a replacement to let him forget."
  3,117,"The likeness of what they expend in the life of this world is as the likeness of a wind wherein is a blast that smote the tillage of a people who have wronged themselves and destroyed it. God did not wrong them but they wronged themselves. They found no inheritance for what they spent for other than God except continuous affliction. They obtained nothing from their calculations except one tribulation after another. That is the recompense of those who reject and turn their backs."
  3,118,"O you who believe do not take as intimates anyone apart from your- selves; such men spare nothing to ruin you; they would love for you to suffer. Hatred is revealed by their mouths; and what their breasts conceal is yet greater. Now We have made clear to you the signs; if you understand. To trust the adversary after difficulties have become apparent is to further facilitate the deception of the enemy. The Real ������ advised the Muslims to be wary of the opposition to declare themselves free of anyone other [than Him] and to continually persist in their devotion to the Real ������ in the heart and innermost self. He stated that from the beginning it was not unexpected that [there would be] opponents of the Messenger ﷺ among the people. How could it not be so when [Muḥammad] ﷺ [was] drawn near and they [were] turned awayḍ How can night be combined with dayḍ"
  3,120,"If good fortune befalls you it is evil for them; but if evil befalls you they rejoice thereat. Yet if you endure and fear [God] their guile will not hurt you at all; God encompasses what they do. This verse alludes to those who abandon the path of spiritual desire irāda and return to the states of the people of habit ahl al-ʿāda. They are not happy to see an aspirant murīd have a breakthrough nafādh; rather they are glad when they see listlessness in a seeker qāṣid. God in His favor and grace perfects His light for the people of His solicitude and He lets the evildoers stray from His path and their distance is punishment. He is not concerned with what comes to them."
  3,121,"you went forth at dawn from your family to assign the believers their places for battle and God hears knows. He put [the Prophet] ﷺ in charge of assigning the places for battle del- egating His command to him. Then He made manifest in this matter the hidden things of His secret. The axis revolves around His determination and decree fa-l-madār ʿalā qaḌāÌihi wa-qadarihi and the crossing over is by means of what He brings about and chooses wa-l-iʿtibār bi-ijrāÌihi wa-ikhtiyārihi."
