  5,24,"(They said: O Moses! We will never enter (the land)) of the giant people (while they are in it. So go thou and thy Lord) go with your master Aaron (and fight) for your Lord will help you as He did against Pharaoh and his people! (We will sit here) and wait."
  5,29,"(Lo! I would rather thou shouldst bear the punishment of the sin against me and thine own sin) of shedding my blood (and become one of the owners of the Fire) of the dwellers of hell. (That is the reward of evil-doers) Hell is the reward of those who wrongfully transgress."
