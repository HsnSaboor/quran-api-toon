tafsir[2]{c,v,t}:
  11,47,"(He said) Noah said: (My Lord!) O my Lord! (Lo! in Thee do I seek refuge (from the sin) that I should ask of Thee) to save (that whereof I have no knowledge) that he deserves to be saved. (Unless Thou forgive me) Noah says: unless you overlook my error (and have mercy on me) such that You do not punish me (I shall be among the lost) through being punished."
  11,51,"(O my people! I ask of you no reward) no price (for it) for believing in Allah's divine Oneness. (Lo! my reward is the concern only of Him who made me) Who created me. (Have ye then no sense?) do you not believe? Are you not possessed of the same mind that human beings possess?"
