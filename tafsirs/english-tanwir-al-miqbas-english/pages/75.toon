tafsir[2]{c,v,t}:
  3,189,"(Unto Allah belongeth the Sovereignty of the heavens and the earth) to Allah belong the stores of the heavens (rain) and the earth (vegetation). (Allah is Able to do all things) in relation to the dwellers of the heavens and the earth and to their stores."
  3,192,"(Our Lord) they say: O our Lord! (Whom Thou causest to enter the Fire: him indeed Thou hast confounded) You have humiliated. (For evil-doers) for the idolaters (there will be no helpers) none will prevent what is going to happen to them in the Hereafter."
