tafsir[2]{c,v,t}:
  10,26,"(For those who do good) for those who profess Allah's divine Oneness (is the best (reward)) i.e. Paradise (and more (thereto)) i.e. beholding Allah's Countenance; it is also said that 'more' means: greater reward. (Neither dust) darkness and gloominess (nor ignominy) grief (comes near their faces) are seen on their faces. (Such are rightful owners of the Garden) the folk of Paradise; (they will abide therein)."
  10,33,"(Thus is the Word of your Lord) to impose His chastisement (justified) enjoined (concerning those who do wrong) concerning the disbelievers: (that they believe not) as it is in Allah's foreknowledge."
