  10,17,"(Who doeth greater wrong) who is more insolent and daring vis-�-vis Allah (than he who inventeth a lie concerning Allah and denieth His revelations) Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an? (Lo! the guilty) the idolaters (never are successful) they will never be saved or safe from Allah's chastisement."
