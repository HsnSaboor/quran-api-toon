tafsir[1]{c,v,t}:
  39,44,"(Say: Unto Allah belongeth all intercession) intercession is in the Hands of Allah on the Day of Judgement. (His is the Sovereignty) the stores (of the heavens) rain (and the earth) vegetation. (And afterward unto Him ye will be brought back) in the Hereafter and will reward each according to his works."
