tafsir[3]{c,v,t}:
  50,3,"(When we are dead and have become dust (shall we be brought back again)? That) which Muhammad claims (would be a far return!) will never happen; thus denying resurrection after death."
  50,8,"(A vision) so that you may see (and a reminder) a lesson so that you may learn from it; it is also said �a vision� means an admonition and �reminder� means reflection (for every penitent slave) who turns to Allah and His obedience."
  50,15,"(Were We then worn out by the first creation) such that We will be worn out by their second creation when We create them for resurrection after death? (Yet they) i.e. the Quraysh (are in doubt about a new creation) after death."
