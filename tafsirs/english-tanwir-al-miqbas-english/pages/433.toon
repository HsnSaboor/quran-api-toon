tafsir[1]{c,v,t}:
  34,42,"(That day) which is the Day of Judgement (ye will possess no use) no intercession (nor hurt) by driving away the torment (one for another) i.e. the angels and the jinn for Banu Malih. (And We shall say unto those who did wrong) those who ascribed partners to Allah: (Taste the doom of the Fire which ye used to deny) in the life of the world."
