tafsir[2]{c,v,t}:
  22,48,"(And how many a township) and how many a population of township (did I suffer long) I gave a reprieve from chastisement (though it was sinful!) though its population were idolaters and disbelievers. (Then I grasped it) I punished them in the life of this world. (Unto Me is the return) in the Hereafter."
  22,49,"(Say: O mankind!) O people of Mecca! (I am) from Allah (only a plain) addressing you in a language you know (warner unto you) a warning Messenger."
