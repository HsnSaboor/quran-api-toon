tafsir[2]{c,v,t}:
  3,106,"(On the day (some) faces will be whitened and (some) faces will be blackened; and as for those whose faces have been blackened it will be said unto them) the angels in-charge of hell will say to them: (Disbelieved ye) in Allah (after your (profession of) belief?) in Allah. (Then taste the punishment for that ye disbelieved) in Allah."
  3,108,"(These are revelations of Allah): the Qur'an. (We recite them unto thee) We send them with Gabriel to you (in truth) in order to show what is true and what is an error. (Allah willeth no injustice to (His) creatures) He does not will to be unjust to the jinn or human beings."
