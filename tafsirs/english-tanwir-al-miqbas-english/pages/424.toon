tafsir[2]{c,v,t}:
  33,44,"(Their salutation) the believers' salutation (on the day when they shall meet Him will be: Peace) from Allah and the angels will greet them at the gates of Paradise. (And He hath prepared for them a goodly recompense) a fair reward in Paradise."
  33,45,"(O Prophet!) He means Muhammad (pbuh) (Lo! We have sent thee as a witness) that you have conveyed the message to your nation (and a bringer of good tidings) i.e. Paradise to whoever believes in Allah (and a warner) against the Fire for those who disbelieve in Him."
