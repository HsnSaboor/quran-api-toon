tafsir[2]{c,v,t}:
  14,12,"They said to the messengers: �do yourselves put your trust in Allah so that you can see what He will do with you�. The messengers said: (How should we not put our trust in Allah when He hath shown us our ways) when He favoured us with prophethood and complete surrender to Him? (We surely will endure that hurt ye do us) we will endure your physical harm through obedience of Allah. (In Allah let the trusting put their trust!) let them rely on Allah."
  14,14,"(And verily We shall make you to dwell in the land) in their township and habitations (after them) after their destruction. (This) dwelling in their land (is for him who feareth My Majesty) standing before Me [on the Day of Judgement] (and feareth My threats) My chastisement."
