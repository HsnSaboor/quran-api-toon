tafsir[2]{c,v,t}:
  40,44,"(And ye will remember) you will know on the Day of Judgement (what I say unto you) in the life of the world regarding the torment. (I confide) I consign (my cause unto Allah) trusting in Him. (Lo! Allah is Seer of (His) slaves) He sees those who believe in Him and those who do not."
  40,46,"(The Fire; they are exposed to it) He says: the spirits of the folk of Pharaoh will be exposed to the Fire (morning and evening) until the Day of Judgement; (and on the day when the Hour upriseth) which is the Day of Judgement ((it is said)) Allah will say to the angels: (Cause Pharaoh's folk to enter the most awful doom) the bottom of hell."
