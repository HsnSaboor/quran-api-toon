tafsir[3]{c,v,t}:
  61,7,"(And who doth greater wrong) in his state of disbelief (than he who inventeth a lie against Allah) by ascribing to Him sons and partners (when he is summoned unto al-Islam) when he is summoned to believe in Allah's divine Oneness. The reference here is to the Jews whom the Prophet (pbuh) invited to embrace the profession of Allah's divine Oneness. (And Allah guideth not wrong-doing folk) He guides not to His religion those Jews whom He knew in His preeternal knowledge that they will die as Jews."
  61,10,"(O ye who believe!) And He explained who they are at the beginning of the surah (Shall I show you a commerce that will save you from a painful doom) in the Hereafter?"
  61,13,"(And (He will give you) another blessing which you love) which you long for and desire to have: (help from Allah) through Muhammad (pbuh) against the disbelievers of Mecca (and present victory) and the conquest of Mecca soon. (Give good tidings (O Muhammad) to believers) to the true believers that they will enter the Garden."
