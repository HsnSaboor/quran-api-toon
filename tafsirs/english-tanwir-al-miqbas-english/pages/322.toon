tafsir[3]{c,v,t}:
  21,3,"(With hearts preoccupied) with hearts heedless of the matter of the Hereafter. (And they confer in secret) they hide among themselves their disbelief in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an. (The wrong-doers) these are the idolaters: Abu Jahl and his host; they say to one another: (say: Is this) they mean Muhammad (pbuh) (other than a mortal like you) other than a human being like you? (Will ye then succumb to magic) will you then believe in magic and lies (when ye see (it)) while knowing that it is magic and lies?"
  21,7,"(And We sent not (as Our messengers) before you other than men) human beings like you (whom We inspired) to whom We sent angels just as We have sent to you. (Ask the followers of the Reminder) the people of the Torah and the Gospel (if you know not) that Allah sent only human messengers?"
  21,10,"(Now We have revealed unto you) unto your Prophet (a Scripture) We sent Gabriel with a Scripture (wherein is your Reminder) wherein lies your eminence and dignity if you believe in it. (Have ye then no sense) do you not believe then in your eminence and dignity?"
