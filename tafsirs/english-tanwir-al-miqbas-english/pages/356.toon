  24,44,"(Allah causeth the revolution of the day and the night) He takes away the night and brings in its stead the day and takes away the day and brings in its stead the night; this is what is meant by their revolution. (Lo! Herein) in the alternation of day and night which I have mentioned (is indeed a lesson) a sign (for those who see) in relation to matters of religion; it is also said that this means: those who see with their eyes."
  24,45,"(Allah hath created every animal) on the face of the earth (of water) from the water of the male and female. (Of them is (a kind) that goeth upon its belly) like the snake and similar animals (and (a kind) that goeth upon two legs) like human beings and those that are similar to them (and (a kind) that goeth upon four) beasts. (Allah createth what He will) as He wills. (Lo! Allah is Able to do all things) whether this concerns creation or other things."
  24,46,"(Verily We have sent down revelations and explained them) He says: We sent Gabriel with revelations expositing the commands and prohibitions. (Allah guideth) to His religion (whom He will) and honours whoever deserves it (unto a straight path) an established religion with which He is pleased: i.e. Islam."
  24,49,"(But if right had been with them) with the people of 'Uthman (they would have come unto him) to the Prophet (pbuh) (willingly) in haste and obediently."
