tafsir[4]{c,v,t}:
  40,71,"(When carcans are about their necks and chains) tied up with the satans. (They are dragged) in the Fire"
  40,72,"(Through boiling waters) they will be put to burn; (then they are thrust into the Fire."
  40,73,"Then it is said unto them) then the angels of the Fire will say to them: (Where are (all) that ye used to make partners) where are those you used to worship"
  40,74,"(Beside Allah) and whom you claim they are associates of Allah? (They say: They have failed us) they are preoccupied with themselves from us; but then they denied this and said: (but we used not to pray to) to worship (anything before) this. (Thus doth Allah send astray the disbelievers (in His guidance)) such that they do not have any proof."
