tafsir[1]{c,v,t}:
  9,49,"(Of them) of the hypocrites (is he who saith) the reference here is to Jadd Ibn Qays: (Grant me leave) to stay at home (and tempt me not) by the women of Historic Syria. (Surely it is into temptation) idolatry and hypocrisy (that they (thus) have fallen. Lo! Hell is all around) will be all around (the disbelievers) on the Day of Judgement."
