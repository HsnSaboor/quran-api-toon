  17,34,"(Come not near the wealth of the orphan save with that which is better) through generating profit from it and by means of preserving it (till he come to strength) 15 or 18 years old; (and keep the covenant) that you pledged in the name of Allah between you and people. (Lo! of the covenant) the one who breaks the covenant (it will be asked) why he broke it on the Day of Judgement."
  17,38,"(The evil of all that) from which I have prohibited you (is hateful in the sight of thy Lord) is bad and hateful in the sight of your Lord."
