tafsir[3]{c,v,t}:
  11,58,"(And when Our commandment) Our chastisement (came to pass We saved Hud and those who believed with him by a mercy from Us) by a grace from Us; (We saved them from a harsh doom) a severe chastisement."
  11,59,"(And such were 'Aad. They denied the revelations of their Lord) which were brought to them by Hud (and flouted His messengers) concerning the declaration of Allah's divine Oneness (and followed the command of every froward) and they followed the words of every tyrant who kills upon being angry (potentate) and who turns away from Allah."
  11,62,"(They said: O Salih! Thou hast been among us hitherto) i.e. before you called us to follow other than the religion of our forefathers (as that wherein our hope was placed) we had hope in you. (Dost thou ask us not to worship what our fathers worshipped) of idols? (Lo! we verily are in grave doubt concerning that to which thou callest us) i.e. your religion."
