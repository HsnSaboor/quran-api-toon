  3,71,"(O People of the Scripture! Why confound ye truth with falsehood) you confound the traits of the anti-Christ with those of Muhammad (and knowingly conceal the Truth?) the traits and description of Muhammad which you find in your Scripture."
  3,74,"(He selecteth for His mercy) He chooses for His religion (whom He will) Muhammad and his Companions. (Allah is of Infinite Bounty) He is generous towards Muhammad by bestowing upon him prophethood and Islam."
