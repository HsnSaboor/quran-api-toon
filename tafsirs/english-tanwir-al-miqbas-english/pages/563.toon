tafsir[2]{c,v,t}:
  67,19,"(Have they) i.e. the disbelievers of Mecca (not seen the birds above them) above their heads (spreading out their wings and closing them? Naught upholdeth them) after their spreading out (save the Beneficent. Lo! He is Seer of all things) whether it is spreading out or closing."
  67,20,"(Or who is he that will be an army unto you to help you instead of the Beneficent) who helps you to avoid the chastisement of the Beneficent? (The disbelievers are in naught but illusion) they are in nothing but the falsehoods and illusion of the life of the world."
