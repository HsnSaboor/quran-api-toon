tafsir[2]{c,v,t}:
  12,89,"(He said) Joseph said to them: (Know ye what ye did unto Joseph and his brother in your ignorance) when you were ignorant youth?"
  12,90,"(They said: Is it indeed thou who art Joseph? He said: I am Joseph and this is my brother) my full brother. (Allah hath shown us favour) by bestowing patience upon us. (Lo! he who wardeth off (evil)) in times of blessing (and endureth) in times of hardship finds favour; (for verily Allah loseth not) thwarts not (the wages) the reward (of the kindly) those who ward off evil and are patient."
