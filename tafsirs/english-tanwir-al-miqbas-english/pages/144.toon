tafsir[3]{c,v,t}:
  6,127,"(For them) for the believers (is the abode of peace with their Lord) Peace (al-Salam) is Allah and His abode is Paradise. (He be their Protecting Friend) who bestows upon them honour and reward (because of what they used to do) and say of goodness in the life of this world."
  6,129,"(Thus We let some of the wrong-doers) the idolaters (have power over others) in the life of this world and in the Hereafter; it is also said that this means: We let some of the idolaters have authority over others (because of what they are wont to earn) and say of evil."
  6,131,"(This) i.e. sending messengers (is because your Lord destroyeth not the townships) the people of the townships (arbitrarily) because of their idolatry or transgression; it is also said that this means: out of injustice (while their people are unconscious) of the commands and prohibitions and the conveyance of the messengers."
