tafsir[3]{c,v,t}:
  10,64,"(Theirs are good tidings in the life of the world) through good dream visions which they see or are seen in their favour (and in the Hereafter) by entering Paradise. (There is no changing the Words of Allah) that they will enter Paradise (that) good tiding (is the Supreme Triumph) the abounding salvation: they earn Paradise and all that is in it and are saved from hell and all that is in it."
  10,67,"(He it is) i.e. it is your Lord (who hath appointed) created (for you the night that you should rest therein and the day giving sight) and the day bright and clear so that you are able to come and go. (Lo! Herein) in that which I have mentioned (verily are portents) lessons (for a folk that heed) the admonitions of the Qur'an and who also obey."
  10,69,"(Say) O Muhammad: (Verily those who invent a lie concerning Allah will not succeed) they will not escape Allah's punishment nor will they be safe."
