tafsir[1]{c,v,t}:
  18,56,"(We send not the messengers save as bearers of good news) Paradise for the believers (and warners) against hell for the disbelievers. (Those who disbelieve) in the scriptures and messengers (contend with falsehood) with idolatry (in order to refute) to nullify (the Truth) and guidance (thereby. And they take Our revelations) Our scriptures and messengers (and that wherewith they are threatened) of chastisement (as a jest) and mockery."
