  20,91,"(They said: We shall by no means cease to be its votaries) we will continue to worship it (till Moses return unto us)."
  20,93,"(That thou followedst me not) that you failed to follow my advice and fight against them? (Hast thou then disobeyed my order) have you then discarded my advice?"
  20,97,"((Moses) said) to him: (Then go) O Samiri! (And lo! in this life) for as long as you live (it is for thee to say: Touch me not) you do not interact with anyone and no one will interact with you! (and lo! there is for you a tryst) you have an appointed time on the Day of Judgement (thou canst not break) you cannot miss. (Now look upon your god of which thou hast remained a votary) look at the god which you worshipped. (Verily we will burn it and will scatter its dust over the sea)"
