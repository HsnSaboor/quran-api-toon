tafsir[2]{c,v,t}:
  47,9,"(That) thwarting (is because they are averse to) they deny (that which Allah hath revealed) that which Allah has sent Gabriel with to Muhammad (pbuh) (therefore maketh He their action fruitless) therefore He thwarts their good deeds and spending at Badr."
  47,10,"(Have they) i.e. the disbelievers of Mecca (not travelled in the land to see) to reflect upon (the nature of the consequence for) the requital of (those who were before them? Allah wiped them out) Allah destroyed them. (And for the disbelievers) of Mecca (there will be the like thereof) the like of that torment."
