tafsir[2]{c,v,t}:
  38,53,"Allah will say to them: (This it is that ye are promised) you were promised in the life of the world (for the Day of Reckoning) on the Day of Judgement."
  38,59,"Allah will say to the first generation of people who entered the Fire: (Here is an army) a group of people (rushing blindly with you) into the Fire. Those who entered hell first will say to those who entered it after them: (No word of welcome for them) may Allah not make it spacious for them. (Lo! they will roast at the Fire) they will abide in the Fire."
