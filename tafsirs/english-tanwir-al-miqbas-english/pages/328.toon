  21,79,"(And We made Solomon to understand) gentleness in judgement; (and unto each of them) David and Solomon (We gave judgement) understanding (and knowledge) prophethood. (And We subdued the hills and the birds to hymn (His) praise along with David) when he praised his Lord. (We were the doers (thereof)) We did that to them."
  21,81,"(And unto Solomon (We subdued) the wind in its raging. It set by His command) and it is also said that this means: by Solomon's command (towards the land which We had blessed) with water and trees; this is the Holy Land: Jordan and Palestine. (And of everything) We subdued for him (We are aware)."
