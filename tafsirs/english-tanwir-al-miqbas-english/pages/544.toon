tafsir[2]{c,v,t}:
  58,15,"(Allah hath prepared for them) for the hypocrites: 'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy and his host (a dreadful doom) in the life of the world and in the Hereafter. (Evil indeed is that which they are wont to do) evil is that which they do in their state of hypocrisy."
  58,16,"(They make a shelter of their oaths) they lie in their oath in order not to be killed (and turn (men) from the way of Allah) they secretly turn people away from Allah's religion and obedience; (so theirs will be a shameful doom) with which they will be humiliated in the Hereafter."
