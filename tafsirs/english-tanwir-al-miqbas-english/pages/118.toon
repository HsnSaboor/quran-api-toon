tafsir[2]{c,v,t}:
  5,62,"(And thou seest) O Muhammad (many of them) i.e. the Jews (vying one with another in sin) competing with one another in committing contraventions and indulging in idolatry (and transgression) wrong-doing and violation against other people (and their devouring of illicit gain) bribery and that which is unlawful in return for changing legal rulings. (Verily evil is what they do) of contraventions and violations against others."
  5,63,"(Why do not the rabbis) the recluse in their cloisters (and the priests) the men of knowledge (forbid their evil speaking) their idolatry (and their devouring of illicit gain) bribery and that which unlawful? (Verily evil is their handiwork) their abstention from forbidding them to do so."
