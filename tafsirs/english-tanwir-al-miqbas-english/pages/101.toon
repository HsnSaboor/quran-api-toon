tafsir[2]{c,v,t}:
  4,144,"(O ye who believe!) only outwardly: 'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy and his followers (Choose not disbelievers) the Jews (for (your) friends) in order to gain power (in place of believers) instead of sincere believers. (Would you) O group of hypocrites (give Allah) give Allah's Messenger (a clear warrant against you?) a clear proof and reason to kill you."
  4,146,"(Save those who repent) from hypocrisy and harbouring disbelief secretly (and amend) that which is between them and their Lord with regard to their scheming and treachery (and hold fast to Allah) they hold fast to their belief in Allah's divine Oneness inwardly (and make their religion) their belief in Allah's divine Oneness (pure for Allah (only). Those are with the believers) they are with the believers inwardly; it is also said that this means that they are with them as far as the promise is concerned; and it is also said that this means that they are with the believers both inwardly and outwardly; and it is said that they are with the believers in Paradise. (And Allah will bestow on the believers) sincere believers (an immense reward) an abundant reward in Paradise."
