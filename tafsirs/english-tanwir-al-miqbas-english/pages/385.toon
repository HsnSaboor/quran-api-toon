tafsir[1]{c,v,t}:
  27,89,"(Whoso bringeth a good deed) whoever comes on the Day of Judgement with �there is no god save Allah� sincerely believing in it (will have better than its worth) all his goodness derives from it; (and such are safe from fear that Day) they are safe from fear and torment when the Fire is closed."
