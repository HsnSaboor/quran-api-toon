  38,32,"(And he said: Lo! I have preferred the good things (of the world)) I have preferred the wealth of this world (to the remembrance of my Lord) to the obedience of my Lord; (till they were taken out of sight behind the curtain) until the sun disappeared behind the mountain of Qaf."
  38,35,"(He said: My Lord! Forgive me) my sin (and bestow on me sovereignty such shall not belong to any after me) it is also said that this means: that will not be taken from me as the first time. (Lo! Thou art the Bestower) of sovereignty and prophethood to whomever you will."
