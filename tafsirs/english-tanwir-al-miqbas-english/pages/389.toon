  28,33,"(He said) Moses said: (My Lord! Lo! I killed a man among them and I fear that they will kill me) in retaliation."
  28,34,"(My brother Aaron is more eloquent then me in speech) because Moses had a slight speech impediment. (Therefore send him with me as a helper to confirm me) to speak on my behalf and confirm my words. (Lo! I fear that they will give the lie to me) deny the message I bring to them."
