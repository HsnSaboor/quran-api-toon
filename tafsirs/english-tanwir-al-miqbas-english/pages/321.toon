tafsir[3]{c,v,t}:
  20,126,"(He will say: So (it must be)). Because (Our revelations) Our Scripture and Messenger (came unto thee but thou didst forget them) you abstained from believing in them or acting upon them. (In like manner thou art forgotten this Day) you will be left in hell."
  20,127,"(Thus do We reward him who is prodigal) him who associates partners with Allah (and believeth not the revelations of his Lord) i.e. the Scripture and the Messenger; (and verily the doom of the Hereafter will be sterner and more lasting) than the torment of this worldly life."
  20,133,"(And they say) i.e. the people of Mecca: (If only he would bring us) why does not Muhammad bring us (a miracle) a sign (from his Lord! Hath there not come unto them the proof) the exposition (of what is in the former Scriptures) what is in the Torah and the Gospel for they contained the attributes and description of the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh)?"
