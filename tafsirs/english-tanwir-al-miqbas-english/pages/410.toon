tafsir[3]{c,v,t}:
  30,53,"(Nor canst thou guide the blind out of their error) towards guidance. (Thou canst make none to hear) your call (save those who believe in Our revelations) in Our Scripture and Messenger (so that they surrender (unto Him)) they are sincere to Him in their worship and confession of Allah's divine Oneness."
  30,55,"(And on the day) which is the Day of Judgement (when the Hour riseth the guilty will vow) those who associate partners with Allah will swear (that they did tarry) in their graves (but an hour thus) they will be in disbelief in the Hereafter (were they ever deceived) just as they disbelieved in the life of this world."
  30,59,"(Thus doth Allah seal the hearts of those who know not) Allah's divine Oneness and disbelieve in it."
