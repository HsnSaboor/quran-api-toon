tafsir[3]{c,v,t}:
  25,24,"(Those who have earned the Garden) Muhammad (pbuh) and his Companions (on that day) the Day of Judgement (will be better in their home) abode (and happier in their place of noonday rest) better and happier than the homes and places of Abu Jahl and their hosts;"
  25,29,"(He verily led me astray from the Reminder) from Allah's divine Oneness and obedience (after it had reached me) after Muhammad (pbuh) reached me with Allah's divine Oneness. (Satan was ever man's deserter in the hour of need) he lets him down at the time of need."
  25,31,"(Even so) just as We have appointed Abu Jahl as your enemy (have We appointed unto every Prophet) before you (an opponent from among the guilty) from the idolaters of his people; (but Allah sufficeth for a Guide) a Preserver (and Helper) and Defender against what they plot against you."
