tafsir[2]{c,v,t}:
  22,8,"(And among mankind is he who disputeth concerning Allah) argues against Allah's religion and Scripture (without knowledge or guidance) or proof (or a Scripture giving light) or Scripture expositing what he says."
  22,13,"(He calleth unto) the Banu'l-Hallaf worship (him whose harm is nearer than his benefit) his harm is near while his benefit is far; (verily an evil patron) an evil lord (and verily an evil friend!) He says: it is truly an evil god him whose worship is harmful."
