tafsir[1]{c,v,t}:
  48,23,"(It is the law of Allah which hath taken course aforetime) regarding past nations that they were exposed to killing and defeat when their rebelled against the prophets of Allah. (Thou wilt not find for the law of Allah) you will not find for the law of Allah of punishing those who rebel against the prophets (aught of power to change) any change."
