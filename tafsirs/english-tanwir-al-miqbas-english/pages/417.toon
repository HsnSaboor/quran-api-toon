  32,23,"(We verily gave Moses the Scripture) the Torah in one bulk; (so be not ye) O Muhammad (in doubt of his receiving it) of meeting Moses the night you were transported to Jerusalem; (and We appointed it) the Scripture of Moses (a guidance for the Children of Israel) from guidance."
  32,25,"(Lo! thy Lord) O Muhammad (will judge between them) between the believer and disbeliever; it is also said: between the Children of Israel (on the Day of Resurrection concerning that wherein) in Religion (they used to differ) they used to oppose."
  32,28,"(And they say) i.e. Banu Khuzaymah and Banu Kinanah say: (When cometh this victory (of yours)) the conquest of Mecca (if ye are truthful) that it will be conquered? They asked this question to mock the believers."
