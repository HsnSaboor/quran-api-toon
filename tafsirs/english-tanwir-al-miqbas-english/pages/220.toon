tafsir[2]{c,v,t}:
  10,98,"(If only there had been a community (of all those that were destroyed of old) that believed) if only the people of a township believed when the punishment befell them (and profited by its belief) He says: their faith did not benefit them upon the descent of punishment (as did the folk of Jonah) except the folk of Jonah who benefited from their belief. (When they believed We drew off) We diverted (from them the torment of disgrace) the severe punishment (in the life of the world and gave them comfort for a while) We left them without punishment until they died."
  10,102,"(What expect they) is there any sign left for them (save the like of the days of those who passed away) except the punishment of those who passed away (before them) among the disbelievers? (Say) O Muhammad: (Expect then!) the descent of punishment and my own destruction! (I am with you among the expectant) of the descent of punishment and destruction upon you."
