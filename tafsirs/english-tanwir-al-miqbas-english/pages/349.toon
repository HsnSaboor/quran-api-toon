I have rewarded them this day) with Paradise (forasmuch as they were steadfast) in obeying me and withholding your harm; (and they verily are the triumphant) they have gained Paradise and become safe from hell. This verse was revealed about Abu Jahl and his host who mocked Salman [al-Farisi] and his fellow-believers"
  23,117,"He who crieth unto) worships (any other god) among idols (along with Allah hath no proof thereof) no proof for worshipping other than Allah.
