tafsir[4]{c,v,t}:
  23,32,"(And We sent among them) and We sent to them (a messenger of their own) of their own lineage (saying: Serve Allah) saying: declare Allah's divine Oneness. (Ye have no other god save Him) you have no other god except the One in Whom I command you to believe. (Will ye not ward off (evil)) the worship of other than Allah?"
  23,38,"(He is only a man) they mean the Messenger is only a man (who hath invented a lie about Allah) in that which he says. (We are not going to put faith in him) we are not going to believe what he says."
  23,40,"(He said) Allah said: (In a little while they surely will become repentant) they will regret their disbelief when the chastisement seizes them."
  23,42,"(Then after them) then after their destruction (We brought forth other generations) from generation to generation."
