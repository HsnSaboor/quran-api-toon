tafsir[2]{c,v,t}:
  14,38,"(Our Lord!) O our Lord! (Lo! Thou knowest that which we hide) of the love of Ishmael (and that which we proclaim) of the love of Isaac; it is also said that this means: You know that which we hide of the love of Ishmael and what we proclaim of aloofness towards him. (Nothing in the earth or in the heaven is hidden from Allah) whether it is a good or evil work."
  14,42,"(Deem not that Allah is unaware of what the wicked do) do not think that Allah will not punish the idolaters for what they do. (He but gives them a respite till a day when eyes will stare (in terror)) the eyes of the disbelievers will stare in terror on the Day of Judgement."
