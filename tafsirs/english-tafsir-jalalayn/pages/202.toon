tafsir[6]{c,v,t}:
  9,94,"They will make excuses to you for having stayed behind when you return to them from the campaign. Say to them ‘Do not make excuses; we will never believe you! God has already told us tidings of you that is He has already informed us of your true status. And God will see your work and so will His Messenger then you will be returned through resurrection to the Knower of the unseen and the visible meaning to God and He will tell you what you used to do’ and requite you for it."
  9,95,"They will swear to you by God when you turn back when you return to them from Tabūk that they had genuine excuses for staying behind so that you may leave them be refraining from reproaching them. So leave them be for they are an abomination filth on account of their inner vileness and their abode shall be Hell as requital for what they used to earn."
  9,96,"They will swear to you that you may be satisfied with them; but if you are satisfied with them God will surely not be satisfied with the wicked folk that is with them your satisfaction is of no avail in the face of the wrath of God."
  9,97,"The Bedouins the Arab nomads are more intense in unbelief and hypocrisy than the city-dwellers on account of their harshness and crude nature and their being too remote to hear the Qur’ān and are more likely not to know the bounds of what God has revealed to His Messenger in the way of rulings and legal prescriptions; and God is Knower of His creatures Wise in what He does with them."
  9,98,"And of the Bedouins there is he who takes what he expends in the way of God as a penalty as a liability and a financial loss because he does not aspire to be rewarded for it but expends it out of fear these were Banū Asad and Banū Ghatafān; and awaits for you evil turns of fortune the fortunes of time for you that these should turn against you and so be rid of you. Theirs shall be the evil read as al-sū‘ or al-saw‘ turn of fortune that is chastisement and destruction shall turn on them not on you. And God is Hearer of the sayings of His servants Knower of their actions."
  9,99,"And of the Bedouins there is he who believes in God and the Last Day such as men from among the tribes of Juhayna and Muzayna and takes what he expends in the way of God as pious offerings to bring him nearer to God and as a means to secure the prayers the supplications of the Messenger for him. Surely these the expenditure of such men will bring them nearer read qurubatun or qurbatun to Him. God will admit them into His mercy His Paradise. Truly God is Forgiving to those who obey Him Merciful to them."
