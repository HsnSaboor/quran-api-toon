tafsir[6]{c,v,t}:
  13,29,"those who believe and perform righteous deeds alladhīna āmanū wa-‘amilū’l-sālihāt is the subject the predicate of which is the following theirs shall be blessedness tūbā is a verbal noun derived from tīb ‘goodness’ or the name of a tree in Paradise whose shade a mounted traveller travelling for 100 years would still not traverse and a fair resort a fair place to return to."
  13,30,"Thus just as We sent prophets before you We have sent you to a community before whom other communities have passed away that you may recite to them that which We have revealed to you that is the Qur’ān; yet they disbelieve in the Compassionate One for when they were commanded to prostrate themselves to Him they said ‘And what is the Compassionate One?’ Say to them O Muhammad (s) ‘He is my Lord; there is no god save Him. In Him I trust and to Him is my recourse’."
  13,31,"The following was revealed when they said to him ‘If you are truly a prophet then make these mountains of Mecca drift away before us and make for us rivers and springs in it that we may plant and sow seeds and resurrect for us our dead fathers to speak to us and tell us that you are a prophet’ Even if it were a Qur’ān whereby the mountains were set in motion moved from their places or the earth were cleft torn or the dead were spoken to such that they would respond they still would not believe. Nay but the affair belongs entirely to God and none other so that none believes except he whom He wills that he believes and no other; even if they were given what they request of signs. The following was revealed when the Companions were keen that what was requested of signs should be manifested hoping that they the ones requesting them might believe Have they not realised those who believe that an is softened in other words understand it as annahu had God willed He could have guided all mankind? to faith without the need for any sign? And the disbelievers from among the people of Mecca continue to be struck by devastation a catastrophe that devastates them through all manner of hardship such as being killed taken captive and suffering war or drought because of what they wrought because of their actions that is their disbelief; or you alight O Muhammad (s) together with your army near their home — Mecca — until God’s promise of victory against them comes to pass; truly God does not break His promise and indeed he alighted at Hudaybiyya until the conquest of Mecca took place;"
  13,32,"messengers were certainly mocked before you in the same way that you have been mocked — this is meant as solace for the Prophet s — but I gave respite to those who disbelieved; then I seized them with retribution and how was My retribution? that is to say it My retribution will come to pass; and I shall deal with those who have mocked you in the same way."
  13,33,"Is He Who stands watches over every soul what it has earned? what it has done of good or evil — and this is God — like the idols who are not so? No! This response is suggested by the following words Yet they ascribe to God associates. Say ‘Name them! for Him who are they? Or will you inform Him will you inform God of something that is of an associate which He does not know in the earth? an interrogative of disavowal; in other words He has no associate for if He did He would know him — exalted be He above such a thing. Or is it — nay — you call them associates merely a manner of speaking?’ that is it is merely on the basis of false conjecture without any truth in it. Nay but their scheming their unbelief has been adorned for those who disbelieve and they have been barred from the way from the path of guidance; and whomever God sends astray for him there is no guide."
  13,34,"For them there is chastisement in the life of this world through being killed or taken captive; and verily the chastisement of the Hereafter is more grievous is more severe; and they have no defender protector from God that is from His chastisement."
