tafsir[5]{c,v,t}:
  42,11,"The Originator of the heavens and the earth the One Who created them without precedent. He has made for you from your own selves pairs when He created Eve from Adam’s rib and also pairs males and females of the cattle He multiplies you read yadhra’ukum by such means by the mentioned ‘making’ that is to say He multiplies you through this means by way of propagation the suffixed pronoun -kum in yadhra’ukum ‘He multiplies you’ refers to both human beings and cattle but predominantly to humans. There is nothing like Him ka-mithlihi the kāf is extra as there is no likeness of Him exalted be He. He is the Hearer of what is said the Seer of what is done."
  42,12,"To Him belong the keys of the heavens and the earth the keys to their storehouses of rain and vegetation and other things. He extends provision He makes it abundant for whomever He will as a test of their gratitude and He restricts it He straitens it for whomever He will as a trial. Truly He has knowledge of all things."
  42,13,"He has prescribed for you as a religion that which He enjoined upon Noah — for he was the first of the prophets sent with a Divine Law — and that which We have revealed to you and that which We enjoined upon Abraham and Moses and Jesus declaring ‘Establish religion and do not be divided in it’ this is what has been prescribed and enjoined upon those mentioned above and what has been revealed to Muhammad (s) and it is the affirmation of God’s Oneness. Dreadful is for the idolaters that to which you summon them in the way of affirming the Oneness of God. God chooses for it for the task of affirming His Oneness whomever He will and He guides to it whomever turns penitently whomever applies himself to obedience of Him."
  42,14,"And they did not become divided that is the adherents of the monotheistic religions did not become divided in religion — so that some affirmed the Oneness of God while others rejected it — except after the knowledge of His Oneness had come to them out of jealous rivalry on the part of the disbelievers among themselves. And were it not for a Word that preceded from your Lord to defer requital of them until an appointed term until the Day of Resurrection it would have already been judged between them to chastise the disbelievers in this world. And indeed those who were made heirs to the Scripture after them namely the Jews and the Christians are truly in grave doubt concerning him Muhammad (s)."
  42,15,"So to that then to that affirmation of God’s Oneness summon O Muhammad (s) people and be upright in summoning them to this just as you have been commanded and do not follow them in their desires to abandon it. And say ‘I believe in whatever Book God has revealed. And I have been commanded to be just between you in passing judgement. God is our Lord and your Lord. Our deeds concern us and your deeds concern you and so each one of us will be requited according to his own deeds. There is no argument no dispute between us and you — this was revealed before the command to struggle against them. God will bring us together at the time of the Return to decide definitively between us and to Him is the final destination’ the ultimate return."
