tafsir[9]{c,v,t}:
  4,66,"And had We prescribed for them the particle an ‘that’ is explicative ‘Slay yourselves’ or ‘Leave your habitations’ as We did for the Children of Israel they would not have done it that is what has been prescribed for them save a few read nominative qalīlun as a substitution; or read accusative qalīlan as an exceptive clause of them; yet if they had done what they were admonished to do of obedience to the Messenger s it would have been better for them and stronger in establishing a stronger confirmation of their faith."
  4,67,"And then that is had they confirmed themselves We would have surely given them from Us a great wage that is Paradise."
  4,68,"And We would have guided them to a straight path. Some Companions said to the Prophet s ‘How will we be able to see you in Paradise when you will be in the highest stations and we will be lower than you?’ and so the following was revealed"
  4,69,"Whoever obeys God and the Messenger in what he commands they are with those whom God has blessed of the prophets and the truthful that is the most excellent of the Prophet’s Companions because of the fullness of their truthfulness and their affirmation of the truth; and the martyrs those slain in the path of God; and the righteous all those other than the ones mentioned. What fine companions they are! in Paradise since in it one will enjoy seeing them visiting them and being in their presence even though they will be in the highest stations in relation to others."
  4,70,"That namely their being with those mentioned dhālika ‘that’ is the subject the predicate of which is the following is bounty from God with which He has favoured them and not because they have earned it through their obedience. God suffices as Knower of the reward of the Hereafter in other words trust in what He has told you None can tell you like One Who is aware Q. 3514."
  4,71,"O you who believe take your precautions against your enemy that is be wary of him and be vigilant against him; then move forward prepare to fight him in companies in separate groups one raiding party followed by the next; or move forward all together in one assembly."
  4,72,"Verily there are some of you who tarry who indeed hesitate to join the fighting such as ‘Abd Allāh b. Ubayy the hypocrite and his companions — counting him the one who tarries as one of them the Muslims is from the perspective of outward appearances — the lām in the verb la-yubatti’anna ‘verily … who tarry’ is for oaths; then if an affliction befalls you such as slaughter or defeat he says ‘God has been gracious to me for I was not a witness with them’ present at the fighting lest I should be hurt."
  4,73,"But if wa-la-in the lām is for oaths a bounty from God befalls you such as a conquest or booty he will surely cry in regret as if ka’an is softened its subject having been omitted in other words it should be ka’annahu there had never been read lam yakun or lam takun any affection any acquaintance or friendship between you and him this statement refers back to the words in the previous verse ‘God has been gracious to me’ and comes as a parenthesis between the statement ‘that he will cry’ and the very words he cries which are ‘Oh yā is for exclamation would that I had been with them so that I might have won a great triumph!’ that is that I might have taken a good share of the booty."
  4,74,"God exalted be He says So let them fight in the way of God to elevate His religion those who sell the life of this world for the Hereafter; and whoever fights in the way of God and is slain dies a martyr or conquers overcomes his enemy We shall give him a great wage a plentiful reward."
