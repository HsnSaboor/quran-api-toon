tafsir[8]{c,v,t}:
  40,78,"And verily We sent messengers before you. Of them are those whom We have recounted to you and of them are those whom We have not recounted to you it is reported that God exalted be He sent 8000 prophets 4000 prophets sent from among the Children of Israel and the other 4000 from among the remainder of mankind. And it was never permitted for any messenger from among them to bring a sign except with God’s permission for they are also servants enthralled by Him. Hence when God’s command comes for the chastisement to be sent down on the disbelievers judgement between the messengers and their deniers is passed justly; and it is thence that the advocates of falsehood become losers that is to say it is thence that the judgement and the loss become manifest for mankind although such advocates of falsehood will have always been losers always before that."
  40,79,"God it is Who made for you cattle — it is said that ‘camels’ are specifically meant here even though it seems to signify cows and sheep also — that you may ride some of them and eat of some."
  40,80,"And there are other uses for you in them such as their milk offspring fur and wool and that by them you may satisfy any need that is in your breasts namely to transport heavy loads to other lands and on them on land and on the ships in the sea you are carried."
  40,81,"And He shows you His signs. So which of God’s signs that is the signs that prove His Oneness do you reject? the interrogative here is meant as a rebuke; ayya ‘which of’ is more commonly made masculine than feminine."
  40,82,"Have they not travelled across the land to see the nature of the consequence for those before them? They were more powerful than them in might and in their vestiges on earth in the way of large structures and palaces. But what they used to earn did not avail them."
  40,83,"And when their messengers brought them clear signs manifest miracles they the disbelievers exulted in the knowledge they the messengers possessed an exultation that entailed mockery and amusement as they rejected such knowledge and there besieged befell them that which they used to deride namely the chastisement."
  40,84,"Then when they saw Our doom that is the severity of Our chastisement they said ‘We believe in God alone and we disavow what we used to associate with Him’."
  40,85,"But their faith was of no benefit to them when they saw Our doom — This is God’s way sunnata’Llāhi is in the accusative because it functions as a verbal noun from an implicit verb of the same expression with the believers among all communities which is that faith is of no benefit to them once the chastisement has been sent down which has its precdent; and it is thence that the disbelievers will be losers — it is thence that their status as losers will become apparent to all of mankind even though they will have always been losers before that."
