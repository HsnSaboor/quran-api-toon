tafsir[11]{c,v,t}:
  17,105,"With the truth have We revealed it that is the Qur’ān and with the truth it comprises has it been revealed in the way it has unaffected by any alterations; and We have not sent you O Muhammad (s) except as a bearer of good tidings of Paradise for those who believe and as a warner of the Fire for those who disbelieve."
  17,106,"And it is a Qur’ān qur’ānan is in the accusative because of the verb governing it which is the following that We have divided that We have revealed in portions over 20 or 23 years that you may recite it to mankind at intervals gradually and with deliberateness so that they are able to comprehend it and We have revealed it by successive revelation one part after another according to what is best for mankind."
  17,107,"Say to the disbelievers of Mecca ‘Believe in it or do not believe as a threat to them; indeed those who were given knowledge before it before its revelation namely the believers from among the People of the Scripture when it is recited to them fall down in prostration on their faces"
  17,108,"and say “Glory be to our Lord exalting Him above the claim that His promise of sending a prophet had not been fulfilled. Indeed in softened Our Lord’s promise of its the Qur’ān’s revelation and the sending of the Prophet s is bound to be fulfilled”."
  17,109,"And they fall down on their faces weeping yabkūna is a supplement to yakhirrūna ‘they fall down’ also containing an adjectival qualification of those falling down; and it the Qur’ān increases them in humility’ in humbleness before God."
  17,110,"The Prophet s would often say ‘O God O Compassionate One’. So they said ‘He Muhammad (s) forbids us to worship more than one god and yet he calls upon another god together with Him God’. The following was then revealed Say to them ‘Invoke God or invoke the Compassionate One that is to say invoke Him by either of these Names or call upon Him by saying ‘O God! O Compassionate One!’ whichever ayyan is conditional; mā is extra in other words whichever of these two Names you invoke is beautiful — this predicate ‘beautiful’ is indicated by the following statement to Him to the One called by these two Names belong the Most Beautiful Names’ these two Names being from among them; and they the other Names are the following as mentioned in hadīth God there is no god except Him the Compassionate the Merciful the King the Holy the Peace the Securer the Controller the Mighty the Compeller the Sublime the Creator the Maker out of nothing the Fashioner the ever Forgiving the Almighty the Bestower the Provider the Deliverer the Knower the Seizer the Extender the Lowerer the Raiser the Glorifier the Abaser the Hearer the Seer the Arbiter the Just the Subtle the Aware the Forbearing the Tremendous the Forgiver the Thankful the High the Great the Preserver the Conserver the Reckoner the Majestic the Generous the Watcher the Responsive the Embracing the Wise the Loving the Glorious the Resurrector the Witnessing the Truth the Guardian the Strong the Firm the Patron the Praiseworthy the Numberer the Initiator the Restorer the Life-giver the Death-maker the Living the Eternal Sustainer the Originator the Magnificent the One the Single the Everlasting Refuge the Powerful the Omnipotent the Advancer the Deferrer the First the Last the Outward the Inward the Ruler Exalted the Benign the Relenting the Avenger the Pardoning the Gentle Master of the Kingdom One of Majesty and Munificence the Equitable the Gatherer the Independent the Availing the Restrainer the Harming the Benefactor the Light the Guiding the Innovator the Enduring the Inheritor the Reasonable the Patient as reported by al-Tirmidhī. God exalted be He says And do not be loud in your prayer when you recite the Qur’ān therein lest the idolaters hear you and curse you as well as the Qur’ān and the One Who has revealed it; nor be silent do not murmur therein so that your companions might be able to hear it and benefit therefrom; but seek between that loudness and silence a middle way."
  17,111,"And say ‘Praise be to God Who has neither taken a son nor has He any partner in sovereignty in divineness nor has He taken any ally to assist Him out of because of any weakness’ that is to say He would never become weak and thus need an assistant. And magnify Him with magnifications worthy of Him extol Him with a perfect extolling above that He should have taken a son or a partner and above any weakness and above all that does not befit Him. The arrangement whereby ‘praise’ is invoked together with this statement is meant to indicate that He is the One worthy of all praise because of the perfection of His Essence and the fact that He alones possesses those attributes of His. Imam Ahmad b. Hanbal relates in his Musnad by way of a report from Mu‘ādh al-Juhanī who heard it from the Messenger of God s who used to say ‘The “glory” verse in the Qur’ān is Praise be to God Who has neither taken a son nor has He any partner in sovereignty … to the end of the above-mentioned sūra 17111’ and God exalted be He knows best. The author of this commentary says ‘This last commentary constitutes the end of my complement to the commentary on the Noble Qur’ān composed by the inquisitive scholar the shaykh Imam Jalāl al-Dīn al-Mahallī al-Shāfi‘ī may God be pleased with him. I have expended every effort in it and reflected throughout it exhaustively especially in those precious things that I have deemed God willing to be profitable. I composed it this commentary in the same length of time appointed for the one spoken to by God sc. Moses and I have made it a means to attaining the Gardens of Bliss. It this commentary actually draws on the work which it complements relying and depending on it for an understanding of those allegorical verses. May God have mercy on one who examines it with impartiality chances upon an error and informs me of it. As I have said “I praise God my Lord for He guided me in what I have expressed despite my incapacity and weakness; for who other than God is there to avert me from error and who is there to accept from me even a single letter”."
  18,1,"Praise — which is the attribution to a person of that which is beautiful — is established as something that belongs to God alone exalted be He. Now is the intention here to point this out for the purpose of believing in it or to praise God thereby or both? All are possibilities the most profitable of which is to understand the third as being the intention behind this statement; Who has revealed to His servant Muhammad (s) the Book the Qur’ān and has not allowed for it that is He has not allowed that there be in it any crookedness any variance or contradiction the last sentence wa-lam yaj‘al lahu ‘iwajan is a circumstantial qualifier referring to al-kitāb ‘the Book’;"
  18,2,"a Book upright qayyiman is a second circumstantial qualifier for added emphasis to warn of to make by this Book the disbelievers fear severe chastisement from Him from God and to bring to the believers who perform righteous deeds the good tidings that theirs will be a fair reward"
  18,3,"wherein they will abide forever and this reward is Paradise;"
  18,4,"and to warn those from among the disbelievers who say ‘God has taken a son’."
