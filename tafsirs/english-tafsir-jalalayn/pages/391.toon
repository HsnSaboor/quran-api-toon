tafsir[7]{c,v,t}:
  28,44,"And you were not O Muhammad (s) on the western side of the mountain the valley or the spot to the west of Moses at the time of the communion when We decreed revealed to Moses the commandment to deliver the Message to Pharaoh and his people nor were you among the witnesses to this to know it and inform of it;"
  28,45,"but We brought forth generations communities after Moses and life was prolonged in their case in other words they lived long lives and so they forgot the covenants made with God knowledge disappeared and revelation ceased. Then We brought you as Messenger and revealed to you the story of Moses and others. And you were not a dweller a resident among the people of Midian reciting to them Our revelations tatlū ‘alayhim āyātinā a second predicate after thāwiyan ‘dweller’ to know their story and inform of it; but truly We are the senders of you as Messenger and the senders to you of the stories of former generations."
  28,46,"And you were not on the side of the Mount when We called out to Moses to take the Scripture earnestly; but We have sent you as a mercy from your Lord that you may warn a people to whom no warner came before you — these are the people of Mecca — and that perhaps they may remember they may be admonished."
  28,47,"Otherwise if an affliction a punishment should befall them because of what their own hands have sent before them in the way of disbelief and otherwise they might say ‘Our Lord why did You not send a messenger to us that we might have followed Your signs the ones sent with the messengers and been of the believers?’ the response to the conditional particle lawlā ‘if’ has been omitted and what follows it is a new subject; the meaning is ‘were it not for the affliction that is the cause of their saying’ or ‘were it not for their saying that is the cause of their affliction We would have hastened on for them their punishment and We would not have sent you as a messenger to them’."
  28,48,"But when the truth namely Muhammad (s) came to them from Us they said ‘Why has he not been given the like of what Moses was given?’ in the way of signs such as the glowing hand the staff and others or by having the Book revealed all at once. God exalted be He says And did they not disbelieve in what was given to Moses before?; before when they said regarding him and Muhammad (s) ‘Two sorcerers sāhirān; a variant reading has sihrān ‘two sorceries’ namely what they said regarding the Qur’ān and the Torah abetting each other.’ And they said ‘We indeed disbelieve in both’ the two prophets and the two Scriptures of Moses and Muhammad."
  28,49,"Say to them ‘Then bring some Scripture from God that is better in guidance than these two Scriptures that I may follow it if you are truthful’ in what you say."
  28,50,"Then if they do not respond to you regarding your invitation to them to bring a Scripture know that they are only following their desires in persisting in their disbelief. And who is more astray than he who follows his desire without any guidance from God? in other words there is no one more astray than such a person. Truly God does not guide the evildoing the disbelieving folk."
