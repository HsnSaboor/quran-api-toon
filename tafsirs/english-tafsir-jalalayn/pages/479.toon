tafsir[9]{c,v,t}:
  41,21,"And they will say to their skins ‘Why did you bear witness against us?’ They will say ‘God made us speak Who gave speech to all things in other words all things which He wanted to be able to speak. And He created you the first time and to Him you will be returned it is said that this statement is made by their skins; but it is also said to be God’s words as is the case with what follows for it is similar in context to what preceded namely that the One with the power to originate you without any precedent and restore you to life after death also has the power to make your skins and your limbs speak."
  41,22,"And you did not use to conceal yourselves when you used to commit lewd acts lest your hearing or your eyes or your skins should bear witness against you because you were never certain about the truth of resurrection; but you thought when you used to conceal yourselves that God did not know most of what you did."
  41,23,"And that wa-dhālikum the subject supposition of yours zannukum substitutes for it which you supposed of your Lord alladhī zanantum bi-rabbikum a descriptive clause; the predicate is the following ardākum has ruined you that is it has brought about your destruction. So you have become among the losers’."
  41,24,"So if they endure the chastisement the Fire will still be their abode; and if they seek reconciliation if they seek the satisfaction of God then they will not be among the reconciled those deemed satisfactory by God."
  41,25,"And We have assigned We have occasioned for them companions from among the devils who have adorned for them that which is before them of what concerns this world and the following after lusts and that which is behind them of what concerns the Hereafter when they make them say that there will be neither resurrection nor reckoning. And the word of chastisement — namely the verse Assuredly I will fill Hell … Q. 11119 — became due against them being among all those communities that passed away that were destroyed before them of jinn and mankind. Truly they were losers."
  41,26,"And those who disbelieve say during the Prophet’s s recitation of the Qur’ān ‘Do not listen to this Qur’ān and hoot it down make a din and so forth and clamour whenever he is reciting that perhaps you might prevail’ so that he will then desist from recitation."
  41,27,"God exalted be He says regarding them But verily We will make those who disbelieve taste a severe chastisement and We will verily requite them the worst of what they used to do in other words with the worst requital for their deeds."
  41,28,"That severe chastisement and worst requital is the requital of God’s enemies jazā’u a‘dā’i the second hamza may be pronounced fully or replaced with a wāw — the Fire! al-nāru an explicative supplement to jazā’u ‘the requital’ alluded to by the demonstrative dhālika ‘that’. Therein will be their everlasting abode that is as a place of permanent residence from which there will be no removal as a requital jazā’an is in the accusative as a verbal noun from the implicit verbal action for their denial of Our signs for their denial of the Qur’ān."
  41,29,"And those who disbelieve will say while in the Fire ‘Our Lord show us those who led us astray from among the jinn and mankind — namely Iblīs and Cain respectively both of whom established disbelief and slaying as something to be emulated — so that we may have them underneath our feet to trample them in the Fire that they may be among the lowermost’ in other words in a chastisement more severe than ours."
