  46,15,"And We have enjoined man to be kind husnan a variant reading has ihsānan that is to say We have commanded him to act kindly towards both of them thus ihsānan is in the accusative as a verbal noun because of the implied verbal action; the same applies to husnan to his parents. His mother carries him in travail and gives birth to him in travail that is to say with suffering; and his gestation and his weaning from suckling take thirty months six months being the minimum period for gestation the remainder being the maximum period of suckling; it is also said that regardless of whether she bore him for six or nine months she should suckle him for the remainder. So that hattā is a particle of purpose for an implied sentence that is to say wa-‘āsha hattā ‘and he lived on so that …’ when he is mature namely at his prime in terms of his strength intellect and reasoning the minimum age for which is thirty or thirty three years and reaches forty years that is exactly forty years which is the maximum for attaining maturity he says ‘My Lord! this to the end of this verse was revealed regarding Abū Bakr al-Siddīq when he had reached forty years of age two years after the beginning of the Prophet’s Mission s. He Abū Bakr believed in him whereafter his parents believed in the Prophet followed by his son ‘Abd al-Rahmān then ‘Abd al-Rahmān’s son Abū ‘Atīq Muhammad b. ‘Abd al-Rahmān. Inspire me to give thanks for Your favour with which You have favoured me and my parents namely the grace of affirming God’s Oneness and that I may act righteously in a way that will please You thus he Abū Bakr emancipated nine believers who had been enduring torture at the hands of the idolaters for their belief in God and invest my seed with righteousness all of them were believers. Indeed I repent to You and I am truly of those who submit to You’."
  46,16,"Those that is those who say such words Abū Bakr and others are they from whom We accept the best of what they do and overlook their misdeeds as they stand among the inhabitants of Paradise fī ashābi’ll-jannati a circumstantial qualifier in other words ‘being among them’ — this is the true promise which they were promised by His words God has promised the believers both men and women Gardens … Q. 972."
  46,17,"As for him who says to his parents li-wālidayhi a variant reading has li-wālidihi ‘his parent’ denoting the generic noun ‘Fie read uffin or uffan as a verbal noun meaning ‘something putrid and disgusting’ on you both I am exasperated at both of you. Do you threaten me a-ta‘idāninī a variant reading has a-ta‘idānnī that I shall be raised from the grave when already generations communities have passed away before me?’ and they have not been raised from their graves. And they call on God for succour that he their child repent saying to him if you do not repent ‘Woe to you waylaka that is to say halākaka ‘you are ruined!’. Believe! in resurrection. Surely God’s promise is true’. But he says ‘This belief in resurrection is nothing but the fables of the ancients’ lies of theirs."
  46,18,"Such are the ones against whom the Word of chastisement is due is necessary concerning communities of jinn and humans that have passed away before them. Truly they are losers."
  46,19,"And for each one of both categories believer and disbeliever there will be degrees of status  thus the degrees of the believers in Paradise are high while the degrees of disbelievers in the Fire are despicable according to what they have done that is to say according to what believers have done in the way of acts of obedience and disbelievers in the way of acts of disobedience and that He may recompense them fully namely God li-yuwaffiyahum a variant reading has li-nuwaffiyahum ‘that We may recompense them fully’ for their deeds that is pay them their deserts and they will not be wronged not even in a single thing that may be diminished for believers or increased for disbelievers."
  46,20,"And on the day when those who disbelieve are exposed to the Fire by its being revealed for them it will be said to them ‘You squandered read with one hamza adhhabtum or with two hamzas as an interrogative a-adhhabtum ‘have you sqaundered …?’; or with one hamza adhhabtum or with an initial long ‘a’ ādhhabtum with both of these pronounced fully or without pronouncing the second hamza your good things during your life of the world by preoccupying yourselves with sensual delights and enjoyed them. So today you will be requited with the chastisement of humiliation in return for acting arrogantly in the earth without right and in return for that regarding which you used to act immorally’ and for the torture you used to inflict upon others therein."
