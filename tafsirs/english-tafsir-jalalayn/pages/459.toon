tafsir[5]{c,v,t}:
  39,6,"He created you from a single soul namely Adam then made from it its mate Eve; and He sent down for you of the cattle of camels cows small cattle sheep and goats eight kinds of each kind a male and a female — as He makes clear in sūrat al-An‘ām Q. 6143f.. He creates you in your mothers’ wombs creation after creation that is to say as a sperm-drop then a blood clot then a foetus in a threefold darkness that is the darkness of the belly that of the womb and that of the placenta. That is God your Lord. To Him belongs all sovereignty. There is no god except Him. Why then are you being turned away? from worshipping Him to worshipping things other than Him?"
  39,7,"If you are ungrateful indeed God is Independent of you though He does not approve of ingratitude for His servants even if He should will it to manifest itself in some of them. And if you give thanks to God and thus become believers He will approve of it read yardah or yardahu either lengthening the vowel or not that is of such thankfulness for you. And no burdened soul shall bear the burden of another soul in other words it will not bear the responsibility for it. Then to your Lord will be your return whereat He will inform you of what you used to do. Indeed He is Knower of what is in the breasts of what is in the hearts of men."
  39,8,"And when distress befalls a person that is the disbeliever he supplicates his Lord he implores turning returning to Him penitently. Then when He bestows on him a grace from Himself he forgets he neglects Him Whom he had supplicated implored before namely God in other words mā functions as min ‘whom’ and sets up equals associates with God that he may lead others astray read li-yadilla or li-yudilla from His way — from the religion of Islam. Say ‘Revel in your ingratitude for a while — for the remainder of your term of life. You shall indeed be among the inhabitants of the Fire’."
  39,9,"Or is he who read softened a-man devotes himself in worship observing duties of obedience in the watches of the night during its hours prostrating and standing in prayer apprehensive of the eventuality of the Hereafter in other words fearing its chastisement and hoping for the mercy the Paradise of his Lord … ? like one who is disobedient through disbelief or otherwise? a variant reading has am-man pronouncing the hamza so that am has the sense of bal ‘rather’. Say ‘Are those who know equal with those who do not know?’ in other words they are not equal just as the person of knowledge is not equal to the ignorant one. Only people of pith possessors of intellect remember only they are admonished."
  39,10,"Say ‘O servants of Mine who believe! Fear your Lord that is to say fear His chastisement by being obedient to Him. For those who are virtuous in this world through obedience there will be good and that is Paradise and God’s earth is vast so emigrate throughout it away from the company of disbelievers and the sight of indecencies. Truly the steadfast in their obedience of God and in enduring whatever hardship they may be tested with will be paid their reward in full without any reckoning’ without any measure or any scales to work it out."
