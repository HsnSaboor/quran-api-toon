tafsir[9]{c,v,t}:
  3,62,"This mentioned above is the true story the report free of any doubt. There is no god but God and assuredly God is Mighty in His Kingdom Wise in His actions."
  3,63,"And if they turn their backs rejecting faith assuredly God knows the agents of corruption and will requite them here the third person pronominalisation has been replaced with the overt noun al-mufsidūn ‘the agents of corruption’."
  3,64,"Say ‘O People of the Scripture! Jews and Christians come now to a word agreed upon sawā’ is the verbal noun meaning mustawin amruhā ‘a word regarding which the matter is upright’ between us and you and it is that we worship none but God allā is made up of an-lā ‘that…not’ and that we do not associate anything with Him and do not take each other for lords beside God’ as you have taken rabbis and monks; and if they turn their backs in rejection of God’s Oneness say you to them ‘Bear witness that we have submitted’ that we are of those who affirm the Oneness of God."
  3,65,"When the Jews claimed that Abraham was Jewish and that they were following his religion and the Christians made a similar claim the following was revealed O People of the Scripture! Why do you argue about dispute over Abraham? claiming that he belonged to one of your two religions when the Torah was not revealed neither the Gospel but a very long time after him and it was only after these two were revealed that Jewry and Christianity came into being. What do you not comprehend? the falsehood of what you say?"
  3,66,"Lo! hā ‘lo’ is for calling attention to something You antum ‘you’ is the subject are those the predicate is what follows who dispute about what you know concerning the affair of Moses and Jesus and your claim to be adhering to their religions why do you then dispute concerning that of which you have no knowledge? of Abraham’s circumstances; and God knows his circumstances and you know not."
  3,67,"God in order to dissociate Abraham from their claims said No; Abraham in truth was not a Jew neither a Christian but he was a Muslim professing the Oneness of God and a hanīf who inclined away from all other religions towards the upright one; and he was never of the idolaters."
  3,68,"Surely the people with the best claim most worthy of Abraham are those who followed him during his time and this Prophet Muhammad (s) on account of his according with him as regards most of the rulings of his Law and those who believe from among his community they are the ones that ought to say ‘We follow his religion’ and not you; and God is the Protector of the believers their Helper and Preserver."
  3,69,"When the Jews called Mu‘ādh b. Jabal Hudhayfa b. al-Yamān and ‘Ammār b. Yāsir to join their religion the following was revealed There is a party of the People of the Scripture who yearn to make you go astray; yet they cause none to stray except themselves because the sin for their leading others astray falls upon them while the believers do not heed them in this; but they are not aware of this."
  3,70,"O People of the Scripture! Why do you disbelieve in God’s verses the Qur’ān that includes all the descriptions of Muhammad (s) when you yourselves bear witness? when you know that it is the truth."
