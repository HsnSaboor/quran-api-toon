  60,6,"Verily there is for you O community of Muhammad (s) laqad kāna lakum is the response to an implied oath in them a good example for those of you who li-man kāna is an inclusive substitution for –kum of lakum ‘for you’ with the same preposition li- repeated anticipate God and the Last Day that is for those who fear these two or who expect reward or punishment. And whoever turns away by befriending the disbelievers should know that God is the Independent without need of His creatures the Worthy of Praise to those who obey Him."
  60,7,"It may be that God will bring about between you and those of them with whom you are at enmity from among the disbelievers of Mecca out of your obedience to God exalted be He affection by His guiding them to faith so that they then become your friends. For God is Powerful able to do that — and He did do this after the conquest of Mecca — and God is Forgiving to them of their past deeds Merciful to them also."
  60,8,"God does not forbid you in regard to those who did not wage war against you from among the disbelievers on account of religion and did not expel you from your homes that you should treat them kindly an tabarrūhum is an inclusive substitution for alladhīna ‘those who’ and deal with them justly this was revealed before the command to struggle against them. Assuredly God loves the just."
  60,9,"God only forbids you in regard to those who waged war against you on account of religion and expelled you from your homes and supported others in your expulsion that you should make friends with them an tawallawhum is an inclusive substitution for alladhīna ‘those who’. And whoever makes friends with them those — they are the wrongdoers."
  60,10,"O you who believe when believing women come to you saying with their tongues that they are emigrating from the company of disbelievers — this was following the truce concluded with them the disbelievers at al-Hudaybiyya to the effect that if any of their number should go to join the believers that person should be sent back — test them by making them swear that they had only gone forth from Mecca because of their sincere wish to embrace Islam and not out of some hatred for their disbelieving husbands nor because they might be enamoured by some Muslim man that was how the Prophet s used to take from them their oaths. God knows best the state of their faith. Then if you know them if you suppose them on the basis of their oaths to be believers do not send them back to the disbelievers. They the women are not lawful for them nor are they the disbelievers lawful for them. And give them that is to say their disbelieving husbands what they have expended on them on such women in the way of dowries. And you would not be at fault if you marry them on that previous condition when you have given them their dowries. And do not hold on read tumassikū or tumsikū to the conjugal ties of disbelieving women your wives for your Islam automatically prohibits you from this or to the ties of those apostatising women who return to the idolaters for likewise their apostatising automatically prohibits you from marrying them and ask for demand the return of what you have expended on these women of dowries in the event of apostasy from those disbelievers to whom they are married. And let them ask for what they have expended on those women who have emigrated as explained above that it may be repaid to them. That is God’s judgement. He judges between you therewith and God is Knower Wise."
  60,11,"And if you lose any of your wives that is to say if you lose one or more of them — or it means if you lose anything of their dowries — by their going to the disbelievers as apostates and so you retaliate you embark upon a raid and capture spoils from them then give those whose wives have gone from the spoils the like of what they have expended for their having lost it to the disbelievers. And fear God in Whom you believe. And indeed the believers did what they had been commanded to do in the way of paying back the disbelievers the dowries of their former wives and the believers the dowries of the women who had apostatised. Afterwards however this stipulation was annulled."
