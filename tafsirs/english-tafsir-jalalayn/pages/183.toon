tafsir[7]{c,v,t}:
  8,46,"And obey God and His Messenger and do not quarrel with one another do not fall into dispute with one another lest you falter become cowardly and your strength your power and dominion fade; and be patient. Surely God is with the patient giving them victory and assistance."
  8,47,"And do not be like those who went forth from their dwellings to defend their caravan and but did not return after it had passed safely in recklessness and to show off to men — when they said ‘We will not return until we have drunk wine sacrificed the camels and have been entertained by singers at Badr and until people have heard about this — barring people from the way of God while God encompasses in knowledge what they do ya‘malūna also read ta‘malūna ‘you do’ and will requite them for it."
  8,48,"And mention that Satan Iblīs adorned their deeds for them by encouraging them to go to meet the Muslims when they had feared to set out on account of their enemy the Banū Bakr and said to them ‘Today no person shall overcome you for I shall be your protector’ from among the Banū Kināna — he appeared to them in the form of Surāqa b. Mālik the chieftain of that region. But when the two armies the Muslims and the disbelievers sighted each other when they met and he Satan saw the angels his hand clasping that of al-Hārith b. Hishām he turned his back he withdrew in flight saying — when they had said to him ‘Are you abandoning us in such a predicament?’ ‘I am quit of you of being your protector for I see what you do not see in the way of angels. I fear God lest He destroy me; and God is severe in retribution’."
  8,49,"When the hypocrites and those in whose hearts is a sickness a weakness of faith said ‘Their religion has deluded them’ that is the Muslims for they had set out to fight a large army despite their small number in the mistaken belief that they will be victorious because of this. God exalted be He says in response to them but whoever relies on God whoever puts his trust in Him he will triumph; for truly God is Mighty His way will prevail Wise in His actions."
  8,50,"And if you could only see O Muhammad (s) when the angels take read either as yatawaffā or tatawaffā the disbelievers beating yadribūna is a circumstantial qualifier their faces and their backs with hooked iron rods and they say to them ‘Taste the chastisement of burning that is the Fire the response to the clause beginning with law ‘if’ would be la-ra’ayta amran ‘azīman ‘you would truly have seen an terrible sight’."
  8,51,"That chastisement is for what your hands have sent before you — He refers to this their actions exclusively with these hands because most actions are accomplished with them — and know that God is never unjust to His servants’ such that he would punish them for no sin."
  8,52,"The way of these people is like the way of Pharaoh’s folk and those before them they disbelieved in God’s signs and so God seized them with chastisement because of their sins the sentence beginning with kafarū ‘they disbelieved’ explains the previous one. Truly God is strong in what He wills severe in retribution."
