  7,138,"And We brought the Children of Israel across the sea and they came upon they passed by a people cleaving in devotion read ya‘kufūn or ya‘kifūn to idols they had constantly worshipping them. They said ‘O Moses make for us a god an idol for us to worship just as they have gods.’ He said ‘Truly you are an ignorant folk for repaying God’s grace to you with what you have said."
  7,139,"Truly as for these their way will be destroyed and what they have been doing is in vain’."
  7,140,"He said ‘Shall I seek other than God as a god for you to worship abghīkum ‘shall I seek for you’ is originally abghī lakum when He has favoured you above all the worlds?’ of your time in the ways He has mentioned in His sayings?"
  7,141,"And remember when We delivered you anjaynākum a variant reading has anjākum ‘He delivered you’ from Pharaoh’s folk who were inflicting upon you who were burdening you and making you taste terrible chastisement the worst kind of chastisement namely slaying your sons and sparing retaining your women; and therein in that deliverance or chastisement was a tremendous trial either a grace or a tribulation from your Lord so will you not heed the admonition and desist from what you are saying?"
  7,142,"And We appointed read wa-wā‘adnā or wa-wa‘adnā for Moses thirty nights at the end of which We would speak to him after he has fasted during that period; that was the month of Dhū’l-Qa‘da. He completed the fast. But when it came to an end he disliked the bad odour of his mouth and so cleaned his teeth. God then commanded him to fast for another ten nights so that He may speak to him despite the odour in his mouth as God says and completed them with ten nights of Dhū’l-Hijja. Thus was the time appointed by his Lord concluded the time at which God had promised him to speak to him as forty arba‘īna is a circumstantial qualifier nights laylatan is for specification; and Moses said to his brother Aaron when he was departing to the Mount for the communion with his Lord ‘Succeed me be my deputy over my people and be righteous among them with regard to their affair and do not follow the way of the agents of corruption’ by consenting with them to acts of disobedience."

And when his Lord revealed Himself that is when He manifested of His Light the equivalent of half a nail of a little finger as stated in one hadīth verified by al-Hākim to the mountain He levelled it to the ground read dakkan or dakkā’a meaning madkūkan and Moses fell down senseless having lost consciousness at the awesomeness of what he had seen. And when he recovered his senses he said ‘Glory be to You! in Your transcendence. I repent to You for having asked You what I was not commanded to ask and I am the first of the believers’ of my time."
