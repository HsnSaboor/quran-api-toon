tafsir[18]{c,v,t}:
  68,43,"With humbled khāshi‘atan is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the person of the verb yud‘awna ‘they are summoned’ that is to say with abject gazes which they do not raise they will be overcast enveloped by abasement; for they had indeed been summoned in this world to prostrate themselves while they were yet sound but they never used to do it by the fact that they never performed prayer."
  68,44,"So leave Me to deal with those who deny this discourse — the Qur’ān. We will draw them on by degrees We will seize them little by little whence they do not know."
  68,45,"And I will grant them respite; for assuredly My devising is firm My devising is severe and cannot be withstood."
  68,46,"Or are you asking them a fee in return for delivering the Message so that they are weighed down with debt? so that they are weighed down with what they will have to give you and that is why they do not believe."
  68,47,"Or do they possess access to the Unseen that is access to the Preserved Tablet which contains knowledge of the Unseen so that they are writing down? from it what they say."
  68,48,"So await patiently the judgement of your Lord regarding them in the way that He wills and do not be like the one of the whale in terms of impatience and haste — this is Jonah peace be upon him — who called out who supplicated his Lord choking with grief filled with anguish inside the belly of the whale."
  68,49,"Had it not been for a grace a mercy from his Lord that reached him he would have surely been cast out of the belly of the whale onto a wilderness a desolate land while he was blameworthy — but he was shown mercy and was therefore cast out blameless."
  68,50,"But his Lord chose him for prophethood and made him one of the righteous the prophets."
  68,51,"Indeed those who disbelieve would almost throw you down to the ground read la-yuzliqūnaka or la-yazliqūnaka with their looks looking at you in a severe way almost hurling you to the ground or making you fall from your place when they hear the Reminder the Qur’ān and they say out of envy ‘He is truly a madman!’ on account of the Qur’ān that he has brought."
  68,52,"Yet it namely the Qur’ān is just a Reminder an admonition for all the worlds of both humans and jinn and cannot be the cause of any dementia."
  69,1,"The Reality the Resurrection in which is realised the truth of all that was rejected in the way of the raising from the graves the reckoning and the requital or it means the Resurrection which will manifest all of that."
  69,2,"What is the Reality? ma’l-hāqqa an interrogative to emphasise its enormity; this is the subject as well as the predicate of the previous al-hāqqa ‘the Reality’."
  69,3,"And how would you know what the Reality is? repeated as an extra emphasis of its enormity; the first mā of the previous verse is the subject the second one its predicate; the second mā and its predicate also function as the second direct object of the verb ‘knowing’."
  69,4,"Thamūd and ‘Ād denied the Clatterer the Resurrection because its terrors cause the hearts to clatter."
  69,5,"As for Thamūd they were destroyed by the overwhelming Roar an excessively severe cry."
  69,6,"And as for ‘Ād they were destroyed by a deafening intensely clamorous violent wind that was powerful and severe in its assault upon ‘Ād despite their power and might."
  69,7,"He forced it upon them for seven nights and eight days the first of which was the morning of Wednesday eight days before the end of the month of Shawwāl and this was at the height of winter successively one after the next husūman it the action of the wind is likened to the repeated actions of a hāsim ‘one cauterizing a wound’ time and again until it the blood has been cut off inhsama so that you might have seen the people therein lying prostrate lying dead on the ground as if they were the hollow collapsed trunks of palm-trees."
  69,8,"So do you see any remnant of them? min bāqiyatin this is either the adjectival qualification of an implicit nafs ‘soul’ or the final suffixed tā’ is for hyperbole in other words understand it as fa-hal tarā lahum min bāqin ‘any one remaining?’ No!."
