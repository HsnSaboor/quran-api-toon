tafsir[4]{c,v,t}:
  5,10,"And they who disbelieve and deny Our signs — they shall be the inhabitants of Hell-fire."
  5,11,"O you who believe remember God’s favour upon you when a people namely Quraysh purposed to extend their hands against you in order to attack you but He restrained their hands from you and protected you from what they intended to do to you; and fear God; and in God let the believers put their trust."
  5,12,"God had made a covenant with the Children of Israel for what will be mentioned shortly and We raised up there is a shift of address away from the third to the first person from among them twelve leaders from each tribe one leader to be responsible for his people’s fulfilment of the covenant as a way of binding them to it. And God said to them ‘I am with you helping and assisting. Surely if la-in the lām is for oaths you establish the prayer and pay the alms and believe in My messengers and succour them help them and lend to God a goodly loan by expending in His way I will absolve you of your evil deeds and I will admit you to gardens underneath which rivers flow. So whoever of you disbelieves after that covenant surely he has strayed from the right way’ he has erred from the path to Paradise al-sawā’ originally means ‘the middle way’. And they broke the covenant."
  5,13,"God says So because bi-mā the mā is extra of their breaking their covenant We cursed them We removed them from Our mercy and made their hearts hard unyielding to the acceptance of faith; they pervert words pertaining to the descriptions of Muhammad (s) in the Torah and other things from their contexts those in which God has placed them in other words they substitute them; and they have forgotten they have abandoned a portion a part of what they were reminded of of what they were enjoined to in the Torah in the way of following Muhammad (s); and you — addressing the Prophet s now — will never cease to discover some treachery on their part in the way of breaking a covenant or some other matter except for a few of them who have submitted themselves to Islam. Yet pardon them and forgive; surely God loves the virtuous this was abrogated by the ‘sword’ verse Q. 95."
