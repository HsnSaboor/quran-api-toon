tafsir[6]{c,v,t}:
  8,70,"O Prophet say to those captives who are in your hands asrā may also be read as asārā ‘If God knows of any good any faith or sincere devotion in your hearts He will give you better than that which has been taken from you by way of ransom by His multiplying it for you in this world and rewarding you in the Hereafter and will forgive you your sins. Truly God is Forgiving Merciful’."
  8,71,"And if they the captives desire to betray you through words which they speak to you they have betrayed God before before Badr through unbelief; but He has given you power over them at Badr through slaying and capture so let them anticipate the like if they return to betrayal; and God is Knower of His creatures Wise in His actions."
  8,72,"Truly those who believed and emigrated and strove with their wealth and their lives in the way of God these being the Emigrants and those who provided refuge for the Prophet s and assisted these being the Helpers those are allies of one another in terms of mutual support and inheritance. And those who believed but did not emigrate — you have no duty to make an alliance read wilāya or walāya with them and so there is no inheriting between you and them and no share of the spoils for them until they emigrate this was abrogated by the end of this sūra; but if they ask you for assistance in the matter of religion then it is your duty to assist them against the disbelievers except against a folk between whom and you there is a covenant a pact in which case do not assist them against these others and so break your pact; and God sees what you do."
  8,73,"And those who disbelieve are allies of one another in terms of mutual support and inheritance and so there is no inheriting between you and them. Unless you do this unless you ally yourselves with the believers and sever relations with the disbelievers there will be sedition in the land and great corruption with disbelief gaining power and Islam becoming weak."
  8,74,"And those who believed and emigrated and strove for the way of God and those who provided refuge and assisted — those are the true believers and for them is forgiveness and a generous provision in Paradise."
  8,75,"And those who believed afterwards that is after the first believers and emigrants and emigrated and strove with you — they are of you O Muhājirūn and Ansār; and those related by blood kinsmen are nearer to one another in terms of inheritance than those who share inheritance on account of their common faith and emigration mentioned in the previous verse according to the Book of God the Preserved Tablet al-lawh al-mahfūz. Truly God is Knower of all things including the wisdom regarding the rules of inheritance."
