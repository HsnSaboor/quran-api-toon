tafsir[11]{c,v,t}:
  10,43,"And of them are some who look toward you. But will you guide the blind even though they do not see? — He likens them the Meccan disbelievers to these the blind because they fail to be guided nay they are much worse since God says It is not the eyes that are blind but blind are the hearts within the breasts Q. 2246."
  10,44,"Verily God does not wrong mankind in any way but mankind wrong themselves."
  10,45,"And on the day when He shall gather them it is as if they had not tarried in this world or in the grave but an hour of the day because of the terror of what they see the comparative sentence is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the third person pronoun; recognising one another knowing one another upon their being resurrected but thereafter the recognition ceases on account of the severity of the terrors the last sentence is either an implied circumstantial qualifier or one connected to the adverbial qualifier yawma ‘on the day’; those will verily have lost who denied the encounter with God through resurrection for they were not guided."
  10,46,"And whether wa-immā the nūn of the conditional particle in has been assimiliated with the extra mā We show you something of that which We promise them of chastisement during your lifetime the response to the conditional statement has been omitted in other words understand it as being fa-dhāka ‘then so shall it be’ or We take you to Us before punishing them to Us they shall return and God moreover is Witness Aware of what they do in the way of their denials and disbelief and so will chastise them with the severest punishment."
  10,47,"And for every community of the communities of this world there is a messenger. And when their messenger comes to them and they deny him judgement is passed between them justly fairly such that they are punished and the messenger and all those who accepted his truthfulness are delivered; and they are not wronged by being punished for no crime similarly We shall deal with these disbelievers of your community."
  10,48,"And they say ‘When will this promise of chastisement come to pass if you are truthful about it?’"
  10,49,"Say ‘I have no power to avert hurt from myself or to bring benefit except as God might will to give me power over so how could I possess the power to bring about the chastisement? For every community there is an appointed time a fixed period until they perish. When their time comes they cannot put it off they will not miss it by a single hour nor bring it forward nor overtake it’."
  10,50,"Say ‘Have you considered? Say inform me If His God’s chastisement comes upon you by night or day what part is there of it that is of the chastisement that the sinners the idolaters seek to hasten? an overt noun al-mujrimūn ‘the sinners’ has replaced the second person ‘you’ pronominalisation. The interrogative sentence is the response to the conditional as in the case where you might say ‘If I come to you what would you give me?’; the intention here is to provoke terror in them in other words how awful is that which they seek to hasten!"
  10,51,"Is it only then when it has come to pass when it has befallen you that you will believe therein? that is in God or it means in the chastisement when it has come down the use of hamza in a-thumma ‘is it then’ is to deny the possibility of deferrment of chastisement in other words it your belief will not be accepted from you in that instance and it will be said to you Now do you believe when until now you have been hastening it on?’ in mockery of it."
  10,52,"Then will it be said to those who were evildoers ‘Taste the everlasting chastisement! that is the one in which you shall abide. Are you you are not requited for anything but the requital of what you used to earn?’"
  10,53,"And they ask you to tell to inform them ‘Is it true?’ that which you promise us in the way of chastisement and resurrection? Say ‘Aye indeed by my Lord! Verily it is true and you cannot escape’ you cannot elude the chastisement."
