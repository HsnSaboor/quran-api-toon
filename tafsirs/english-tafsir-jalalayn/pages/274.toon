  16,67,"And of the fruits of date-palms and vines comes forth a fruit from which you draw an intoxicant a wine that intoxicates — it the wine is referred to by the verbal noun sakaran ‘intoxicant’ and this verse came before it was prohibited — and goodly provision such as dates raisins vinegar and molasses. Surely in that which is mentioned there is a sign indicating His power exalted be He for a people who understand a people who reflect."
  16,68,"And your Lord revealed to the bee a revealing effected through inspiration saying an ‘that’ is either explicative or relates to the verbal noun ‘Choose among the hills habitations to which you can resort and among the trees also habitations and among the trellises which they raise that is the places which humans build for you — for otherwise it the bee would not resort to these places."
  16,69,"Then eat from every kind of fruit and follow enter the ways of your Lord follow His paths in seeking pastures ways made easily accessible’ dhululan is the plural of dhalūl and is a circumstantial qualifier referring to al-subul ‘the ways’ in other words those paths disposed for you such that they pose no difficulty for you even if it should be rough terrain and such that you would not lose your way when returning therefrom even if it be far away; it dhululan is also said to be a circumstantial qualifier referring to the person of the pronominal suffix of fa’slukī ‘you follow’ meaning in this case follow those paths in compliance with what is required of you. There comes forth from their bellies a drink namely honey of diverse hues wherein is a cure for mankind from all ailments; it is also said that it means that it is a cure only for some ailments as indicated by the indefinite noun shifā’un ‘a cure’; or that it is a cure for all ailments when supplemented with some other remedy; or without these other remedies but with the resolve niyya to get better.

  16,70,"And God has created you when you were nothing then He takes you in death when your terms of life are concluded; and there are some among you who are relegated to the most abject stage of life that is the most diminished because of old-age and senility so that he knows nothing after having possessed some knowledge. ‘Ikrima said ‘Whoever recites the Qur’ān will not come to such a predicament’.

  16,71,"And God has favoured some of you above others in respect of provision thus some of you are poor some are rich some owners others are owned. Now those who have been more favoured namely the masters would not hand over their provision to those slaves whom their right hands possess that is they would not assign that wealth and other things which We have given them as something to be shared equally between them and their slaves so that they that is the slaves and their masters become equal partners in respect thereof. The meaning is they do not have partners from among their slaves in respect of their wealth so how can they make certain of God’s servants partners of His? Is it then the grace of God that they deny? that they reject when they ascribe partners to Him?"
  16,72,"And God made for you mates from your own selves thus He created Eve from Adam’s rib and created all mankind from the seminal fluids of men and women and made for you from your mates children and grandchildren and He provided you with the good things of all kinds of fruits seeds and animals. Is it then in falsehood in the idol that they believe and in the grace of God that they disbelieve? when they associate others with God?"
