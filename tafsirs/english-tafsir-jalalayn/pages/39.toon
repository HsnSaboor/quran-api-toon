tafsir[8]{c,v,t}:
  2,238,"Maintain the five prayers by performing them at their appointed times and the middle prayer either that of the afternoon or the morning or the midday or another prayer there are many opinions on this matter; God has singled it out for mention because of its merit; and stand in prayer submissive to God li Lllāhi qānitīn some have said that this means ‘obedience’ on account of the Prophet s saying ‘Wherever the expression qunūt ‘submission’ appears in the Qur’ān it denotes obedience’ as reported by Ahmad b. Hanbal and others; it is also said to mean ‘in silence’ sākitīn on the basis of a hadīth of Zayd b. Arqam in which he said ‘We used to speak to each other sometimes during prayer but when this was revealed we were commanded to be silent and were forbidden to talk’ as reported by the two Shaykhs Bukhārī and Muslim."
  2,239,"And if you are in fear of an enemy or a torrent or a predatory animal then standing rijāl plural of rājil praying while walking or mounted rukbān plural of rākib. In other words in whichever way you can facing the direction of the qibla or otherwise making the gestures of genuflexion and prostration; but when you are secure from any fear then remember God by performing prayer as He taught you what you knew not before He taught you its obligations and its proper ways the particle kāf of ka-mā ‘as’ has the same meaning as mithl ‘like’ while the mā is related to the verbal action or is relative."
  2,240,"And those of you who die leaving wives let them make testament wasiyyatan or wasiyyatun for their wives as an obligation and give them provision what they can enjoy of property and clothes for until the completion of a year matā‘an ilā l-hawl ‘provision for a year’ is a circumstantial qualifier that is without expelling them from their habitations; but if they go forth of their own accord you would not be at fault you the guardians of the dead one regarding what they may do with themselves honourably in accordance with the Law such as adorning themselves or abandoning the mourning or that you should cut off their expenditure; God is Mighty in His Kingdom Wise in His actions. The testament mentioned here was abrogated by the ‘inheritance’ verse Q. 412 and the waiting of one year without expulsion was abrogated by the previous verse four months and ten Q. 2234 which was revealed later. In the opinion of al-Shāfi‘ī may God have mercy on him the habitation remains hers."
  2,241,"There shall be provision for divorced women which they are given honourably as is feasible — an obligation haqqan ‘obligation’ is in the accusative because it is governed by an implied verb on those who fear God may He be exalted. He has repeated the phrase in order to include the woman that has been touched sexually since the previous verse addresses a different issue."
  2,242,"So in the same way that He has explained to you what has been mentioned God makes clear His signs for you so that you might understand reflect."
  2,243,"Have you not seen an interrogative to provoke amazement and a longing to hear what will follow that is ‘Has your knowledge not attained’ those thousands four eight ten thirty forty or seventy thousand who went forth from their habitations fearful of death? hadhara’l-mawt an object denoting reason. These were a people from among the Children of Israel who fled their homeland after it was afflicted with plague. God said to them ‘Die!’ and they did. Then He gave them life after eight days or more as a result of the supplication of their prophet Ezekiel Hizqīl and they lived on for a while with the effects of death still upon them such that when they wore garments these turned into shrouds for the deceased; and this phenomenon remained with their descendants. Truly God is bounteous to people such as when He gave life back to those just mentioned but most people that is disbelievers are not thankful. The purpose of mentioning the story of these people is to encourage believers to fight in the way of God which is why the following statement is supplemented to it"
  2,244,"So fight in God’s way in order to elevate His religion and know that God is Hearing of your sayings Knowing of your affairs and He will requite you accordingly."
  2,245,"Who is he that will lend God a loan by expending his property in the way of God that is good by expending it for the sake of God Mighty and Majestic out of pureness of heart and He will multiply yudā‘if also read yuda‘‘if it for him manifold? up to ten or seven hundred times or more as will be mentioned soon. God straitens sustenance for whomever He wills in order to try him and enlarges it in abundance for whomever He wills in order to test him; and to Him you shall be returned in the Hereafter through the Resurrection where He will requite you for your deeds."
