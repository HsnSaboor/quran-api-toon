  29,46,"And do not dispute with the People of the Scripture unless it be with that — in that manner of disputation bettering the most virtuous way such as calling them to God by reference to His signs and pointing out His arguments; except in the case of those of them who have done wrong by waging war and refusing to accept to pay the jizya-tax dispute with these using the sword until such time as they submit or pay the jizya-tax; and say to those who have accepted the imposition upon them of the jizya-tax should they inform you of something stated in their Scriptures ‘We believe in that which has been revealed to us and revealed to you — and neither believe nor disbelieve them in that which they tell you — our God and your God is one and the same and to Him we submit’ to Him we are obedient."
  29,47,"Thus have We revealed to you the Book the Qur’ān in the same way that We have revealed to them the Torah and other scripture. And so those to whom We have given the Scripture the Torah such as ‘Abd Allāh b. Salām and others believe in it in the Qur’ān and of these people of Mecca there are some who believe in it; and none denies Our signs after they have been manifested except disbelievers namely the Jews and those for whom it was apparent that the Qur’ān was the truth and that the one who brought it was truthful but still denied it."
  29,48,"And you did not use to recite before this namely before the Qur’ān any other Book nor did you write it with your right hand for had you been reciting something and writing then those who follow falsehood the Jews would have had doubts about you and would have said ‘What the Torah states is that he will be unlettered ummī unable to read or write’."
  29,49,"Nay but it that is the Qur’ān which you have brought is clear signs in the breasts of those who have been given knowledge namely the believers who preserve it in their hearts and none denies Our signs except wrongdoers namely the Jews — they denied them after they were manifested to them."
  29,50,"And they namely the disbelievers of Mecca say ‘Why has not some sign been sent down to him to Muhammad (s) from his Lord?’ āyatun ‘sign’ a variant reading has āyātun ‘signs’ such as the she-camel of Sālih or the staff of Moses or the Table of Jesus. Say to them ‘Signs are only with God and He sends them down as He will and I am only a plain warner’ making manifest my warning of the punishment of the Fire for disobedient people."
  29,51,"Is it not sufficient for them regarding what they have demanded that We have revealed to you the Book the Qur’ān which is recited to them? — as it constitutes a ongoing sign that will never terminate in contrast to the signs mentioned. Surely in that Book is mercy and a reminder an admonition for a people who believe."
  29,52,"Say ‘God suffices as a witness between me and you’ of my sincerity. He knows whatever is in the heavens and the earth including my circumstances and yours. And those who believe in falsehood namely all that is worshipped besides God and who disbelieve in God from among you — those they are the losers in their bargain for they have purchased disbelief in return for faith."
