  16,8,"And He created horses and mules and asses that you may ride them and for adornment wa-zīnatan is an object denoting reason; the use of both of these reasons ‘to ride’ and ‘for adornment’ as illustrations of God’s graces does not preclude that they may have been created for other purposes such as for consumption in the case of horses — which is established as lawful by a hadīth in both Sahīhs of Bukhārī and Muslim; and He creates what you do not know of marvelous and strange things."
  16,9,"And God’s is the direction of the way that is to point out the straight path and some of them that is the paths are deviant swerving away from straightness. And had He willed to guide you He would have guided you to seek the way all so that you would be rightly guided of your own choice."

  16,14,"And He it is Who disposed the sea He it is Who subdued it that it might be sailed upon and dived in that you may eat from it fresh meat that is fish and bring forth from it ornaments which you wear namely pearls and coral.
