  6,69,"The Muslims then said ‘If we get up and leave every time they delve into the matter of the Qur’ān we would never be able to sit in the Mosque or perform circumambulations. Therefore the following was revealed Those who fear God are not accountable for them for those who discourse in mockery in anything min shay’in min is extra if they should sit with them; but it is the reminder that they are accountable for; a reminder given to make them remember and to admonish them so that perhaps they will be wary of discoursing thus."
  6,70,"And forsake leave alone those who take their religion with which they have been charged as a game and a diversion making a mockery of it and whom the life of this world has deluded and so do not interfere with them — this was revealed before the command to fight them. Remind admonish people thereby by the Qur’ān lest a soul perish lest it be given up for destruction for what it has earned what it has done; it has no protector no helper besides God other than Him and no intercessor to ward off the chastisement from it; and though it offer every compensation though it pay every ransom it shall not be accepted from it that which it offers as ransom. Those are the ones who perish by what they have earned; for them shall be a draught of boiling water and a painful chastisement because they disbelieved that is for their unbelief."
  6,71,"Say ‘Shall we call upon shall we worship instead of God that which neither profits us if we worship them nor hurts us if we neglect to worship them — these are the idols; and so be turned back and so return to idolatry after God has guided us to Islam? — Like one whom the devils have lured led astray in the earth bewildered confused not knowing where to go hayrān ‘bewildered’ is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the suffixed pronoun hā’ of istahwat-hu ‘whom they have lured’; he has companions a group who call him to guidance that is to say they are there in order to guide him to the right path saying to him “Come to us!”’ but he does not respond to them and he perishes the interrogative statement is meant as a disavowal; the comparative statement beginning with ka’lladhī ‘like one whom’ is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the subject of the verb nuraddu ‘be turned back’. Say ‘Truly God’s guidance which is Islam is the true guidance everything else being error and we have been commanded to submit to the Lord of the Worlds"
  6,72,"and to that is to submit by establishing prayer and fearing Him exalted be He; He it is to Whom you shall be gathered’ you shall be brought together on the Day of Resurrection for reckoning."
  6,73,"He it is Who created the heavens and the earth in truth that is to say with the purpose of manifesting truth. And mention the day He says to a thing ‘Be’ and it is — this is the Day of Resurrection when He says to creatures ‘Rise up’ and they do. His words are the truth the truth that will doubtless come to pass; and His is the Kingdom the day when the trumpet the horn is blown the second blast by the angel Isrāfīl when there shall be no kingdom for any other than Him ‘Whose is the Kingdom today? God’s’ Q. 4016. He is the Knower of the Unseen and the visible what is hidden and what may be seen. He is the Wise in His creation the Aware of things inwardly hidden and outwardly manifest."
