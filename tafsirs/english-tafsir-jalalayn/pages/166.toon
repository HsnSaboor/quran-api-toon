  7,131,"But whenever a good thing such as fertility and abundance befell them they said ‘This belongs to us’ that is we deserve it and they did not give thanks for it; and whenever an evil thing such as drought or hardship smote them they would augur ill of Moses and those believers with him. Surely their ill augury is with God Who brings it upon them but most of them do not know that whatever befalls them is from Him."
  7,132,"And they said to Moses ‘Whatever sign you bring us to cast a spell upon us therewith we will not believe in you’ and so he Moses invoked God against them."
  7,133,"So We unleashed upon them the flood of water which penetrated their houses and which for seven days would come up to people’s necks as they sat; and the locusts which consumed their crops and fruits likewise engulfing them for seven days; and the lice al-qummal is like al-sūs ‘woodworm’ or al-qurād ‘ticks’ which would follow and consume what the locusts left behind; and the frogs such that they infested their houses and food supplies; and the blood flowing in their water distinct clear signs but they were too scornful to believe in them and were a sinful folk."
  7,134,"And when the terror the chastisement fell upon them they said ‘O Moses pray to your Lord for our sake by the covenant which He has made with you to remove the chastisement from us if we believe. Indeed if la-in the lām is for oaths you remove from us the terror verily we will believe in you and let the Children of Israel go with you’."
  7,135,"But when We removed through the supplication of Moses the terror from them to a term which they should reach lo! they were already reneging breaking their covenant and persisting in their disbelief."
  7,136,"So We exacted retribution from them and therefore We drowned them in the sea al-yamm denotes salty waters for the reason that they denied Our signs and were heedless of them not reflecting upon them."
  7,137,"And We bequeathed upon the people who were oppressed through bondage namely the Children of Israel the eastern parts of the land and the western parts thereof which We had blessed with water and trees allatī bāraknā fīhā ‘which We had blessed’ is an adjectival qualification of al-ard ‘the land’ and this was Syria and the fair word of your Lord was fulfilled which was His saying exalted be He Yet We desired to be gracious to those who were oppressed in the land... to the end of the verse Q. 285 for the Children of Israel because they endured patiently persecution at the hands of their enemy; and We destroyed utterly what Pharaoh and his folk had been creating by way of architecture and what they had been erecting read ya‘rishūn or ya‘rushūn what they had been raising of edifices."
