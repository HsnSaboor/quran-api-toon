  5,77,"Say ‘O People of the Scripture Jews and Christians do not go to extremes do not overstep the bounds in your religion other than those extremes of truth neither lowering nor elevating Jesus above his proper place and do not follow the whims of a people who went astray formerly on account of their extremism — these were their forefathers — and have led many other people astray and strayed from the even way’ from the path of truth al-sawā’ originally means ‘middle’."
  5,78,"Cursed were the disbelievers of the Children of Israel by the tongue of David when he invoked God against them and they were transformed into apes — these were the people of Eilat — and by Jesus son of Mary when he invoked God against them and they were transformed into pigs — they were the ones who ate at the Table cf. Q. 5115 below — that cursing was because of their disobedience and their transgression."
  5,79,"They did not prevent one another that is one would not forbid the other from committing again any indecency that they committed; verily evil was what they used to do verily evil was this deed of theirs."
  5,80,"You O Muhammad (s) see many of them affiliating with those who disbelieve from among the Meccans out of spite for you. Evil is that in the way of deeds which their souls have offered on their behalf for the day of their inevitable return such that God is wroth with them and in the chastisement they shall abide."
  5,81,"Yet had they believed in God and the Prophet Muhammad (s) and what has been revealed to him they would not have affiliated with them namely with the disbelievers; but many of them are wicked rebellious against faith."
  5,82,"You O Muhammad (s) will truly find the most hostile of people to those who believe to be the Jews and the idolaters of Mecca because of the intensity of their disbelief ignorance and utter preoccupation with following whims; and you will truly find the nearest of them in love to those who believe to be those who say ‘Verily we are Christians’; that nearness of theirs in love to the believers is because some of them are priests scholars and monks devout worshippers and because they are not disdainful of following the truth as the Jews and the Meccans are."
