tafsir[6]{c,v,t}:
  10,15,"And when Our clear manifest bayyināt is a circumstantial qualifier verses from the Qur’ān are recited to them those who do not expect to encounter Us those who do not fear the Resurrection say ‘Bring a Qur’ān other than this one in which our gods are not denigrated or change it’ of your own accord. Say to them ‘It is not for me to change it of my own accord. I only follow that which is revealed to me. Truly I fear if I should disobey my Lord by changing it the chastisement of a dreadful day’ that is the Day of Resurrection."
  10,16,"Say ‘If God had willed I would not have recited it to you nor would He have made it known to you nor would He have made you aware of it the lā of wa-lā adrākum is for negation and is a supplement to what preceded; a variant reading has the lām sc. la-adrākum ‘He would have made it known to you’ as the response to the conditional law ‘if’ in other words He would have made it known to you by the tongue of someone other than myself. For I have already dwelt among you a whole lifetime of forty years before this Qur’ān not relating to you anything of the sort so will you not understand?’ that this Qur’ān is not from myself?"
  10,17,"And who that is no one does greater evil than he who invents a lie against God by ascribing a partner to Him or denies His signs? denies the Qur’ān. Surely it is that the sinners the idolaters shall not prosper they shall never find happiness."
  10,18,"And they worship besides God that is other than Him that which can neither hurt them should they not worship it nor profit them if they do worship it — and these are the idols; and they say of them ‘These are our intercessors with God’. Say to them ‘Would you tell would you inform God of what He does not know in the heavens or in the earth?’ the interrogative is meant as a disavowal for if He had a partner He Himself would know it since nothing can be hidden from Him. Glory be to Him! in affirmation of His transcendence and High be He exalted above what they associate! with Him."
  10,19,"Mankind was but one community following one religion that is submission to the One God from the time of Adam to the time of Noah; but it is also said that this was the case from the time of Abraham to that of ‘Amr b. Luhayy; then they differed some of them remaining firmly upon belief in One God while others disbelieved. And had it not been for a word that had already preceded from your Lord to the effect that requital would be deferred until the Day of Resurrection it would have been decided between them that is between mankind in this life regarding that over which they differed in religion by the disbelievers being punished."
  10,20,"And they the people of Mecca say ‘Why has a sign not been sent down on him on Muhammad (s) from his Lord?’ as was the case with previous prophets in the way of a she-camel a staff or a glowing hand. Then say to them ‘The Unseen that which is concealed from servants in other words its affair belongs only to God and it is from this Unseen that signs come forth; therefore He alone can bring them forth mine is only to covey the Message. So wait for the chastisement if you do not believe. I am waiting with you’."
