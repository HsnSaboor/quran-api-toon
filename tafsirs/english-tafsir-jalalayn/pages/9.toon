  2,58,"And when We said to them after they came out of the wilderness ‘Enter this city either the Holy House of Jerusalem Bayt al-Maqdis or Jericho Arīhā and eat freely therein wherever you will plentifully and without any restrictions and enter it at the gate its gate prostrating bowing and say ‘our request is for an exoneration’ that is ‘That we be exonerated from our transgressions’ and We shall forgive naghfir a variant reading has one of the two passive forms yughfar or tughfar ‘they will be forgiven’ you your transgressions and We shall give more to those who are virtuous’ — through obedience — in terms of reward."
  2,59,"Then the evildoers among them substituted a saying other than that which had been said to them and said instead ‘A grain inside a hair’ and entered the town dragging themselves on their rears; so We sent down upon the evildoers the replacement of the second person of the previous verse with the overt identification in the third person alladhīna zalamū ‘the evildoers’ is intended to emphasise the depravity of their action wrath a punishment of plague from the heaven for their wickedness for deviating from obedience and within a very short period of time just under seventy thousand of them were dead."
  2,60,"And mention when Moses sought water for his people for they suffered thirst in the wilderness We said ‘Strike with your staff the rock the one that ran off with his robe a light cube-like rock about the size of a man’s head made of marble and he struck it and there exploded there burst and gushed forth from it twelve fountains equal to the number of tribes each people each tribe among them came to know their drinking-place which they did not share with any of the others.
