tafsir[11]{c,v,t}:
  2,38,"We said ‘Go down from it from the Garden all together He has repeated this phrase qulnā ihbitū in order to supplement it with yet fa-immā the nūn of the conditional particle in ‘if’ has been assimilated with the extra mā there shall come to you from Me guidance a Book and a prophet and whoever follows My guidance believing in me and performing deeds in obedience of Me no fear shall befall them neither shall they grieve in the Hereafter since they will be admitted into Paradise."
  2,39,"As for the disbelievers who deny Our signs Our Books those shall be the inhabitants of the Fire abiding therein’ enduring perpetually neither perishing nor exiting therefrom."
  2,40,"O Children of Israel sons of Jacob remember My favour wherewith I favoured you that is your forefathers saving them from Pharaoh parting the sea sending clouds as shelter and other instances for which you should show gratitude by being obedient to Me; and fulfil My covenant that which I took from you that you believe in Muhammad (s) and I shall fulfil your covenant that which I gave to you that you shall be rewarded for this with Paradise; and be in awe of Me fear Me and not anyone else when you have abandoned belief in him the Prophet."
  2,41,"And believe in what I have revealed of the Qur’ān confirming that which is with you of the Torah by its agreement with it in respect to affirmation of God’s Oneness and prophethood; and be not the first to disbelieve in it from among the People of the Scripture for those who will come after you will depend on you and so you will bear their sins. And do not sell exchange My signs those that relate to the description of Muhammad (s) in your Book; for a small price for a trivial and temporary affair of this world; that is to say do not suppress this for fear of losing what you hope to earn from lowly individuals among you; and fear Me and none other in this matter."
  2,42,"And do not obscure confuse the truth that I have revealed to you with falsehood that you fabricate; and do not conceal the truth the description of Muhammad (s) wittingly that is knowing it to be the truth."
  2,43,"And establish prayer and pay the alms and bow with those that bow that is pray with those who pray Muhammad (s) and his Companions this was revealed concerning their religious scholars who used to say to their kin from among the Muslims ‘Stay firm upon the religion of Muhammad (s) for it is the truth’."
  2,44,"Will you bid others to piety to belief in Muhammad (s) and forget yourselves neglecting yourselves and not bidding them to the same while you recite the Book? in which there is the threat of chastisement if what you do contradicts what you say. Do you not understand? the evil nature of your actions that you might then repent? the sentence about ‘forgetting’ constitutes the syntactical locus of the interrogative of disavowal."
  2,45,"Seek help ask for assistance in your affairs in patience by restraining the soul in the face of that which it dislikes; and prayer. The singling out of this for mention is a way of emphasising its great importance; in one hadīth it is stated ‘When something bothered the Prophet s he would immediately resort to prayer’; it is said that the address here is to the Jews when greed and desire for leadership became impediments to their faith they were enjoined to forbearance which constituted fasting and prayer since the former stems from lust and the latter yields humility and negates pride. For it prayer is grievous burdensome except to the humble those that are at peace in obedience"
  2,46,"who reckon who are certain that they shall meet their Lord at the Resurrection and that to Him they are returning in the Hereafter where He will reward them."
  2,47,"O Children of Israel remember My favour wherewith I favoured you by giving thanks through obedience to Me and that I have preferred you your forefathers above all the worlds of their time;"
  2,48,"and fear be scared of the day when no soul for another shall give satisfaction which is the Day of Resurrection and no intercession shall be accepted read either tuqbal or yuqbal from it that is it is not the case that it has power to intercede for it then to be accepted from it or rejected as God says So now we have no intercessors Q. 26100; nor any compensation ransom be taken neither shall they be helped to avoid God’s chastisement."
