tafsir[13]{c,v,t}:
  27,23,"I found a woman ruling over them in other words she was their queen her name Bilqīs; and she has been given an abundance of all things that kings might require in the way of machines and instruments and she possesses a great throne — its length was 80 cubits its width 40 cubits its height 30 cubits and was made of gold and silver encrusted with pearls rubies chrysolite and emeralds with its legs made of rubies chrysolite and emeralds containing seven inner doors the door of each chamber shut."
  27,24,"I found her and her people prostrating to the sun instead of God and Satan has adorned for them their deeds and he has barred them from the Way from the path of truth so that they are not guided"
  27,25,"to prostrate themselves to God allā yasjudū should be read as an yasjudū the lā is extra and with it has been assimilated the nūn of an similar to the construction where God says li-allā ya‘lama ahlu’l-kitābi so that the People of the Scripture may know Q. 5729; the sentence functions as the direct object of yahtadūna ‘guided’ whose ilā ‘to’ has been omitted; He Who brings forth the hidden al-khab’ is a verbal noun with the same meaning as al-makhbū’ ‘that which is hidden’ of rain and plants in the heavens and the earth and He knows what they conceal within their hearts and what they proclaim with their tongues."
  27,26,"God — there is no god except Him the Lord of the Mighty Throne’ this clause constitutes an independent new sentence which is a eulogy comprising praise of the Throne of the Compassionate One to counter the description of the throne of Bilqīs between the two however is an unfathomable difference."
  27,27,"He Solomon said to the hoopoe ‘We shall see whether you have spoken the truth in what you have informed us or whether you are of the liars that is of their ilk — for to say that is rhetorically more powerful than simply saying ‘or whether you have lied’. He the hoopoe indicated to them the place of the water and it was extracted. They thus drank performed their ablutions and prayed. Solomon then composed a letter in the following form ‘From the servant of God Solomon son of David to Bilqīs Queen of Sheba. In the Name of God the Compassionate the Merciful Peace be upon those who follow Guidance. To wit do not rise up against me in defiance but come to me in submission’. He then stamped it with musk and sealed it with his ring and said to the hoopoe"
  27,28,"Take this letter of mine and deliver it to them that is to Bilqīs and her people then turn away withdraw from them but remain close by them and see what response they shall return’ and see what kind of response they shall give. Thus he took it and approached her Bilqīs. But as her soldiers were all around her he cast it into her private chamber. When she saw it she shuddered and was consumed by fear. She read what it said."
  27,29,"Then she said to the noblemen of her people ‘O members of the council lo! read yā ayyuhā’l-mala’u innī pronouncing in the last two words both hamzas; or by not pronouncing the second one and changing it into a wāw with kasra vowelling a noble a sealed letter has been delivered to me."
  27,30,"It is from Solomon and lo! it is in other words its text says “In the Name of God the Compassionate the Merciful."
  27,31,"Do not rise up against me in defiance but come to me in submission”’."
  27,32,"She said ‘O members of the council give me an opinion read yā ayyuhā’l-mala’u aftūnī pronouncing both hamzas or by not pronouncing the second and changing it into a wāw in other words guide me in this matter of mine. I never decide on a matter I never conclude it until you are present’."
  27,33,"They said ‘We possess force and we possess great might in other words we are hardy in war. The matter is for you to decide. So see what you will command’ us and we will obey you."
  27,34,"She said ‘Indeed kings when they enter a town ruin it with destruction and reduce the mightiest of its inhabitants to the most abased. That is what they too will do namely the senders of this letter."
  27,35,"Now I will send them a gift and wait to see with what response the envoys return’ in the way of accepting the gift or rejecting it. If it be a king to whom we have sent it he will accept it; but if it be a prophet he will reject it. Thus she sent male and female servants one thousand in total together with five hundred bricks of gold a crown studded with jewels and musk ambergris and other things with an envoy carrying a letter. The hoopoe thus hurried back to bring the news to Solomon who ordered bricks of gold and silver to be made and laid out across a vast square the distance of nine parasangs from his seat and for a towering wall of gold and silver to be constructed around it and for the most splendid creatures of the land and the sea together with the children of the jinn to be brought to line the right and left sides of the square."
