tafsir[6]{c,v,t}:
  6,119,"What is wrong with you that you do not eat from that over which God’s Name has been invoked of sacrifices when He has detailed for both verbs read the passive fussila ‘it has been detailed’ and hurrima ‘that which has been forbidden’ or the active fassala ‘He has detailed’ and harrama ‘what He has forbidden’ for you what He has forbidden in the verse Forbidden to you is carrion … Q. 53 except that to which you are compelled? thereof which is also lawful for you. The meaning is there is nothing to prevent you from eating what has been mentioned for He has explained to you what is forbidden for consumption and that over which God’s Name has been invoked is not among these forbidden things. But truly many are led astray read la-yadillūna ‘many are led astray’ or la-yudillūna ‘many lead others astray’ by their whims by what their own selves fancy in the way of permitting the consumption of carrion and otherwise without any knowledge with which to support their claims. Truly your Lord knows the transgressors those who overstep the bounds of what is lawful into what is unlawful."
  6,120,"And forsake leave outward aspect of sin and its inward aspect that is what is overt of it and what is secret — it is said that ‘sin’ here means fornication or it is said any act of disobedience; surely those who earn sin shall be requited in the Hereafter for what they used to perpetrate what they used to earn."
  6,121,"And do not eat from that over which God’s Name has not been invoked where it has died or been sacrificed to other than His Name — otherwise what a Muslim sacrifices and does not invoke God’s Name over whether intentionally or forgetfully is lawful as was stated by Ibn ‘Abbās and this is the opinion of al-Shāfi‘ī — verily it the eating thereof is wickedness a contravention of what is lawful. And truly the devils inspire whisper to their friends the disbelievers to dispute with you in deeming carrion lawful; and if you obey them in this matter you are truly idolaters."
  6,122,"The following was revealed regarding Abū Jahl and others Why is he who was dead through unbelief and We gave him life through guidance and appointed for him a light by which to walk among people distinguishing thereby the truth from falsehood — this light being faith — as him whose likeness ka-man mathaluhu mathal ‘likeness’ is extra; in other words read ka-man huwa ‘as him who’ is in darkness whence he cannot emerge? — and this is the disbeliever — No! So in the same way that faith has been adorned for believers what the disbelievers have been doing in the way of disbelief and acts of disobedience has been adorned for them."
  6,123,"And thus in the same way that We have made the wicked folk of Mecca its leaders We have made in every city its sinners great ones that they may plot therein to impede the faith; but they plot only against themselves because the evil consequences thereof will befall them though they do not perceive this."
  6,124,"And when a sign of the truth of the Prophet s comes to them the people of Mecca they say ‘We will not believe in him until we are given the like of what God’s messengers were given’ in the way of a message and inspiration to us because we are wealthier and more senior in years. God exalted be He says God knows best where to place His Message read plural risālātihi ‘His Messages’ or singular risālatahu ‘His Message’; hayth ‘where’ constitutes the direct object because of the verb ya‘lam ‘He knows’ implicit in a‘lam ‘the best knower’ that is to say He knows the right place for it to be placed in and He thus places it there — these people however are not worthy of it. Humiliation from God and a terrible chastisement shall smite those who have sinned by saying this for their plotting."
