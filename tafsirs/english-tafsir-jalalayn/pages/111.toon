tafsir[6]{c,v,t}:
  5,18,"The Jews and Christians both of them say ‘We are the sons of God that is we are like his sons in terms of closeness and rank and He is like a father to us in terms of compassion and care and His beloved ones’. Say to them O Muhammad (s) ‘Why then does He chastise you for your sins? if what you say is true. For the father does not punish his son nor the loving his beloved; but He has punished you and therefore you are saying lies. Nay; you are mortals from among all those mortals He created you shall be rewarded as they are rewarded and you shall be requited as they are requited. He forgives him for whom He wills forgiveness and He chastises him for whom He wills’ chastisement and there can be no objection thereto. For to God belongs the kingdom of the heavens and of the earth and all that is between them; to Him is the journey’s end the final return."
  5,19,"O People of the Scripture there has verily come to you Our Messenger Muhammad (s) making clear to you the laws of religion after an interval between the messengers for there was no messenger between him and Jesus an interval of 569 years; lest you should say if you are punished ‘There has not come to us any bearer of good tidings min bashīr the min is extra nor any warner’. Indeed there has come to you a bearer of good tidings and a warner and so you shall have no excuse. God has power over all things including punishing you for not following him the Messenger."
  5,20,"And mention when Moses said to his people ‘O my people remember God’s favour to you when He established among you that is from among you prophets and established you as kings possessing servants and retinues and gave you such as He had not given to any in all the worlds in the way of manna and quails the parting of the sea and other things."
  5,21,"O my people enter the Holy the purified Land which God has ordained for you which He commanded you to enter and this is Syria al-shām and do not turn back in flight do not retreat in fear of the enemy or you will end up as losers’ in your efforts."
  5,22,"They said ‘O Moses there are giants in it those remaining of the people of ‘Ād who were very tall and mighty; we will never enter it until they depart from it; if they depart from it then we will enter’ it."
  5,23,"There said to them two men of those who feared contravening God’s command and these were Joshua and Caleb — who were from among the leaders that Moses dispatched to bring back news of those giants — to whom God had been gracious by making them virtuous for they concealed what they had discovered about the giants telling only Moses unlike the other leaders who divulged the news and so the people became cowardly. ‘Enter against them by the gate! the gate of the town and have no fear of them for they are bodies without hearts. For if you enter by it you will be victorious the two Joshua and Caleb said this because they were certain of God’s assistance and the fulfilment of His promise. Put your trust in God if you are believers’."
