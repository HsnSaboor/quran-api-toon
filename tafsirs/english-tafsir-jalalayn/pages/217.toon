tafsir[8]{c,v,t}:
  10,71,"And recite O Muhammad (s) to them that is to the Meccan disbelievers the story the tale of Noah Nūhin is substituted by the following idh qāla when he said to his people ‘O my people if my sojourn my stay among you is too great to bear is a hardship for you as is my reminding you my admonishing you by the signs of God in God have I put my trust; so decide upon your course of action resolve upon what you will do to me together with your associates wa-shurakā’akum the wāw wa- means here ‘with’ then let not your decision be a secret between you concealed nay manifest it and proclaim it to me; then implement it against me carry out what you desire and do not put it off do not give me respite for I am not concerned by you."
  10,72,"But if you turn away from my reminding you I have not asked you for any wage any reward for it so turn and go away my wage my reward falls only on God and I have been commanded to be of those who submit to God’."
  10,73,"But they denied him so We saved him and those with him in the Ark and made them that is those with him successors in the earth and We drowned those who denied Our signs by unleashing the Flood. Behold then the nature of the consequence for those who had been warned! in that they were destroyed likewise We deal with those who deny."
  10,74,"Then after him that is after Noah We sent messengers to their people such as Abraham Hūd and Sālih and they brought them clear proofs miracles but it was not for them to believe in that which they had denied before that is before the sending of messengers to them. Thus do We seal stamp upon the hearts of the transgressors — so that they cannot accept faith — in the same way that We sealed the hearts of those before."
  10,75,"Then after them We sent Moses and Aaron to Pharaoh and his council that is his folk with Our nine signs but they were disdainful to believe in them and were a sinful folk."
  10,76,"So when the Truth came to them from Us they said ‘Surely this is manifest sorcery’ sorcery that is clear and evident."
  10,77,"Moses said ‘Do you say so of the Truth when it has come to you that it is sorcery? Is this sorcery? when the one who has brought it has indeed prospered and has invalidated the sorcery of the sorcerers? Now sorcerers do not prosper’ the interrogative in both instances is meant as a disavowal."
  10,78,"They said ‘Have you come to us to divert us to turn us away from what we found our fathers following and that yours both might be the greatness the kingship in the land the land of Egypt? We will not believe you two’."
