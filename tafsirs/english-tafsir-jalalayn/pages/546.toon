  59,6,"And whatever spoils God has given to His Messenger from these you did not O Muslims spur for it any min is extra horses or camels that is to say you did not suffer any hardship in securing it but God gives His messengers sway over whomever He will and God has power over all things hence you have no right to any of this booty rather it is exclusively for the Prophet s and those of the four categories mentioned with him in the next verse to be dispensed in accordance with the way in which he used to divide it up such that each would receive a fifth of the fifth and the rest being the Prophet’s s for him to do with as he pleases — thus he gave of it to the Emigrants and three from among the Helpers on account of their poverty."
