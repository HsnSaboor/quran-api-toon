  25,48,"And He it is Who sends forth the winds al-riyāha; a variant has al-rīha ‘the wind’ dispersing before His mercy nushuran ‘dispersing’ scattered before the coming of the rain a variant reading has nushran the singular of which is nashūr similar in pattern to rasūl ‘messenger’ plural rusul; another reading has nashran as a verbal noun; and a third variant has bushran in other words the winds function as mubashshirāt ‘bearers of good tidings’ the singular of which is bashīr; and We send down from the heaven purifying water"
  25,49,"with which We revive a dead land read maytan in the softened form equally valid for the masculine and the feminine but in the masculine here because of the masculine noun indicating ‘place’ implicit therein and We give it the water as drink to the many cattle camels cows and sheep and humans We have created anāsiyy is the plural of insān properly it the plural should be anāsīn but the final nūn has been replaced with a yā’ with which the other yā’ has been assimilated; or it anāsiyy is simply the plural of insiyy."
  25,50,"And verily We have distributed it the water among them so that they may remember li-yadhdhakkarū should actually be li-yatadhakkarū but the tā’ has been assimilated with the dhāl; a variant reading has li-yadhkurū that is to say so that they may remember therewith the grace of God.

  25,54,"And He it is Who created man from water He created from a sperm-drop a human being and made for him ties of blood and ties of marriage whether it be a male or a female they marry for the purposes of procreation. For your Lord is ever Powerful with the power to do whatever He will."
  25,55,"And they the disbelievers worship besides God that which neither benefits them when they worship it nor harms them should they refrain therefrom — and these are idols; and the disbeliever is ever a partisan against his Lord an assistant to Satan through his obedience to him."
