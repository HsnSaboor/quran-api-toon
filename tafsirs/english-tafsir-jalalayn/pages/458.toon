tafsir[10]{c,v,t}:
  38,84,"He said ‘So the truth is — and the truth I always speak read both words in the accusative fa’l-haqqa wa’l-haqqa; or with the first in the nominative and the second in the accusative because of the verb aqūlu ‘I speak’ that follows. As for reading the first one in the accusative this would be on account of the mentioned verb qāla ‘he said’; but it is also said to be on account of its being a verbal noun the sense being uhiqqu l-haqqa ‘I establish the truth’; or it is in the accusative by implication if the particle for the oath fa is removed. It the first haqq could also be in the nominative because of its being the subject of a missing predicate as in fa’l-haqqu minnī ‘truth comes from Me’. It is also said that the sentence means fa’l-haqqu qasamī ‘the truth is this oath from Me’ the response to which is the following la-amla’anna … —"
  38,85,"I shall assuredly fill Hell with you by way of filling it with your progeny and with whoever of them follows you that is of mankind all together’."
  38,86,"Say ‘I do not ask of you in return for this for delivering the Message to you any reward any fee; nor am I an impostor so as to make up the Qur’ān myself."
  38,87,"It is only in other words the Qur’ān is only a reminder an admonition for all worlds those of humans jinn and other rational beings but excluding the angels."
  38,88,"And you will assuredly come to know O disbelievers of Mecca its tiding the news of its truth in due time’ that is to say on the Day of Resurrection ‘ilm ‘knowing’ is here being used in the sense of ‘urf ‘experience’; the prefixed lām in la-ta‘lamunna ‘you will assuredly know’ is for an implicit oath in other words what is meant is wa’Llāhi la-ta‘lamunna ‘By God you will assuredly know’."
  39,1,"The revelation of the Book the Qur’ān tanzīlu’l-kitābi the subject is from God mina’Llāhi its predicate the Mighty in His kingdom the Wise in His handiwork."
  39,2,"Indeed We have revealed to you O Muhammad (s) the Book with the truth bi’l-haqqi is semantically connected to anzalnā ‘We have revealed’; so worship God devoting your religion purely to Him pure of any idolatry in other words affirming His Oneness."
  39,3,"Surely to God belongs pure religion none other than Him being deserving of it. And those who take besides Him the idols as patrons and they are the disbelievers of Mecca — they say ‘We only worship them so that they may bring us near to God’ zulfā a verbal noun with the sense of taqrīban ‘for the sake of nearness’. God will indeed judge between them and the Muslims concerning that about which they differ of religion and so admit the believers into Paradise and the disbelievers into the Fire. Truly God does not guide one who is a liar attributing a child to Him a disbeliever worshipping other than God."
  39,4,"Had God wanted to take a son — as they allege that He has ‘The Compassionate One has taken to Himself a son’ Q. 1988 He could have chosen from what He has created whatever He willed and taken it as a child instead of the angels whom they claim to be God’s daughters or their claim that ‘Ezra is the son of God’ or that ‘Jesus is the son of God’ cf. Q. 930. Glory be to Him in exaltation of Him as being above that He should take a child. He is God the One the All-Compelling over all His creatures."
  39,5,"He created the heavens and the earth with the truth bi’l-haqqi is semantically connected to khalaqa ‘He created’. He turns the night into day so that it grows and turns the day into night so that it grows and He has disposed the sun and the moon each running in its course for an appointed term until the Day of Resurrection. Verily it is He Who is the Mighty Whose way always prevails Requiter of His enemies the ever Forgiving of His friends."
