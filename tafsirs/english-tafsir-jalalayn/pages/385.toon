tafsir[10]{c,v,t}:
  27,89,"Whoever brings a good deed namely the profession of ‘there is no god but God’ on the Day of Resurrection shall have good shall have a reward for it because of it this khayrun is not the comparative ‘better’ since there is no deed better than a good deed. In another verse it is stated that he shall have tenfold the like of it Q. 6160; and they namely those who bring such good deeds shall be secure from the terror of that day min faza‘i yawmi’idhin if read as a genitive annexation; or min faza‘in yawma’idhin ‘from terror on that day’."
  27,90,"And whoever brings an evil deed namely the ascribing of partners to God their faces shall be thrust into the Fire having been oriented towards it — ‘faces’ are specifically mentioned here because of all the sensory organs it is where a person’s dignity resides and so other parts of the body are more deserving of punishment. It shall be said to them in reproach ‘Are you requited except the requital for what you used to do?’ in the way of idolatry and acts of disobedience."
  27,91,"Say to them I have been commanded only to worship the Lord of this land namely Mecca which He has made inviolable which He has made a secure Sanctuary one in which no human blood may be shed no person may be wronged none of its prey may be hunted and a sanctuary which is never deserted. Such were the graces bestowed by God upon its inhabitants the tribe of Quraysh graces whereby God has spared their land the suffering and civil strife common to all the other lands of the Arabs; and to Whom exalted be He all things belong for He is their Lord Creator and Possessor. And I have been commanded to be of those who submit to God by affirming His Oneness;"
  27,92,"and to recite the Qur’ān to you as a call to faith. So whoever is guided to it is guided only for his own sake since the reward for his being guided will be his; and whoever goes astray from faith and errs from the path of guidance say to him ‘I am just one of the warners’ the threateners and therefore my duty is only to deliver the Message — this was revealed before the command to fight against the disbelievers."
  27,93,"And say ‘Praise be to God. He will show you His signs and you will recognise them. Thus on the day of Badr God showed them how it was to be killed to be taken prisoner and to be beaten by the angels on their faces and backs; and God hastened on for them the punishment of the Fire. And your Lord is not oblivious of what they do’ ya‘malūna; or read ta‘malūna ‘what you do’ but grants them respite until their appointed time of requital."
  28,1,"Tā sīn mīm God knows best what He means by these letters."
  28,2,"Those namely these signs are the signs of the Manifest Book the genitive annexation conveys the partitive sense of min ‘of’ ‘verses from the Manifest Book’ the Manifest Book which reveals truth from falsehood."
  28,3,"We will recount narrate to you something of the tale of Moses and Pharaoh truthfully for a people who believe for their sake since they are the ones to benefit from such an account."
  28,4,"Truly Pharaoh had exalted himself in the land the land of Egypt and reduced its people into sects groups to serve him oppressing a group of them namely the Children of Israel slaughtering their sons the new-born and sparing their women keeping them alive — for some of the Egyptian priests had told him ‘A new-born of the Children of Israel shall bring about the end of your kingdom’. Indeed he was of those who cause corruption through the use of slaughter and otherwise."
  28,5,"And We desired to show favour to those who were oppressed in the land and to make them exemplars read a’immatan pronouncing both hamzas or by replacing the second one with a yā’ whose good example would be followed and to make them the inheritors of Pharaoh’s kingdom;"
