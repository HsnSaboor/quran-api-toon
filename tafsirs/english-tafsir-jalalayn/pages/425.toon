  33,51,"You may put off read turji’ or turjī you may postpone consorting with whomever of them you wish namely of your wives from their turn for intimacy and consort embrace in conjugality whomever you wish of them and come unto her and as for whomever you may desire of those whom you have set aside from their share you would not be at fault to desire her and consort with her again. He was given the choice in this respect after it had been obligatory for him to give each wife her equal share of conjugality. That freedom of choice makes it likelier that they will be comforted and not grieve and that they will be satisfied with what you give them of what has been mentioned of your freedom to choose whom to consort with every one of them kulluhunna emphasises the subject of the verb yardayna ‘they will be satisfied’ will be well-pleased with what you give her. And God knows what is in your hearts with respect to your women and your preferring some to others. We have given you the freedom to choose from among them in order to make it easier for you to have what you desire. And God is Knower of His creatures Forbearing in refraining from punishing them."
  33,52,"Women are not lawful for you read lā tahillu or lā yahillu beyond that beyond the nine that have chosen you as their husband nor is it lawful for you to change tabaddala one of the two original tā’ letters of tatabaddala has been omitted them for other wives by divorcing them or some of them and marry in place of those whom you divorce even though their beauty impress you except those whom your right hand owns of slavegirls which is in contrast lawful for you. In addition to these slavegirls the Prophet s came to own Māriya the Copt. She bore for him Ibrāhīm who died during his lifetime. And God is Watcher over Preserver of all things."
  33,53,"O you who believe do not enter the Prophet’s houses unless permission is granted you to enter by invitation to share a meal and so you enter without waiting for the right moment for when it is ready ināhu a verbal noun from anā ya’nī. But when you are invited enter and when you have had your meal disperse without lingering for any leisurely conversation amongst yourselves. Indeed that lingering is upsetting for the Prophet and he is too shy of you to make you leave but God is not shy of the truth that you should leave — in other words He would never refrain from declaring it a variant reading for yastahyī has yastahī. And when you ask anything of his womenfolk in other words the wives of the Prophet s ask them from behind a screen a curtain. That is purer for your hearts and their hearts than entertaining sinful thoughts. And you should never cause the Messenger of God hurt in any way; nor ever marry his wives after him. Assuredly that in God’s sight would be very grave as a sin."
  33,54,"Whether you disclose anything or keep it hidden regarding marrying them after him truly God has knowledge of all things and will requite you for it."
