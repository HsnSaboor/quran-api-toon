tafsir[8]{c,v,t}:
  10,7,"Truly those who do not expect to encounter Us through resurrection and are content with the life of this world instead of the life the Hereafter since they reject the truth of it and feel reassured feel secure in it and those who are heedless of Our signs of the proofs of Our Oneness neglecting to ponder them"
  10,8,"those their abode will be the Fire because of what they used to earn in the way of practising idolatry and performing acts of disobedience."
  10,9,"Truly those who believe and perform righteous deeds their Lord will guide them He will lead them through their faith in Him by appointing for them a light with which they will be able to find their way on the Day of Resurrection. Rivers will flow beneath them in the Gardens of Bliss"
  10,10,"their prayer therein their request for what they desire in Paradise will be to say ‘Glory be to You O God!’ so that lo! what they request they find before them; and their greeting between them therein will be ‘Peace.’ And their final prayer will be ‘Praise be to God Lord of the Worlds’."
  10,11,"When the idolaters sought to hasten their chastisement the following was revealed And if God should hasten for mankind evil as they would hasten good their term of life would already have been concluded for them read as the passive with nominative ajaluhum sc. la-qudiya ajaluhum; or read as the active with accusative ajalahum sc. la-qadā ajalahum ‘He would have already concluded their term’ by His destroying them but He gives them respite. But We leave those who do not expect to encounter Us to wander blindly in their insolence hesistant and perplexed."
  10,12,"If misfortune illness or poverty should befall a disbelieving man he calls upon Us on his side that is lying down or sitting or standing in other words in every state; but when We have relieved him of his misfortune he passes on in his unbelief as if ka-an is softened its subject omitted in other words read as ka-annahu he had never called upon Us because of a misfortune that befell him. So in the same way that supplication during misfortune and abstention from supplication in times of comfort were adorned for him is adorned for the prodigal the idolaters that which they do."
  10,13,"And indeed We have destroyed generations communities before you O people of Mecca when they did evil by way of idolatry and indeed their messengers brought them clear proofs indicating their truthfulness; but they would not believe wa-mā kānū li-yu’minū this is a supplement to zalamū ‘they did evil’. So just as We destroyed those We shall requite the sinning the unbelieving folk."
  10,14,"Then We made you O people of Mecca successors khalā’if is the plural of khalīfa in the earth after them that We might behold how you would behave in it and whether you would take heed from their example and believe in Our messengers."
