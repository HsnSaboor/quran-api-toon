tafsir[7]{c,v,t}:
  11,13,"Or do they say ‘He has invented it’? that is the Qur’ān. Say ‘Then bring ten sūras the like thereof in terms of clarity and rhetorical excellence invented for you are Arabs who speak Arabic eloquently like myself — he challenged them to these ten sūras first and then to one sūra — and call in order for them to assist you upon whom you can beside God that is on other than Him if you are truthful’ about it the Qur’ān being an invention of lies."
  11,14,"Then if they that is those on whom you call for assistance do not answer you know this address is to the idolaters that it has been revealed enwrapped only in God’s knowledge not as an invention of lies against Him and that an is softened in other words understand it as annahu there is no god save Him. Will you then submit? after this definitive argument; in other words ‘Submit!’"
  11,15,"He who desires the life of this world and its adornment by persisting in idolatry — it is said that this was revealed regarding the dissimulators — We shall repay them their deeds that is the requital of any good that they did such as charity or kindness to kin in it by giving them abundant provision and therein that is in this world they shall not be defrauded they shall not be made to suffer diminution in anything."
  11,16,"Those are they for whom there is nothing in the Hereafter but the Fire; what they contrive will have failed will be invalid therein that is in the Hereafter and will not be rewarded and useless is that which they used to do."
  11,17,"Is he who relies on a clear proof a clear statement from his Lord meaning the Prophet s or the believers; it the proof being the Qur’ān a clear proof which is followed by a witness to it of its veracity as being from Him that is from God; he the witness being Gabriel and before it before the Qur’ān was the Book of Moses the Torah also a witness to it as an example and a mercy? imāman wa-rahmatan is a circumstantial qualifier is such a person like one who is not so? No! Those that is the ones who rely on a clear proof they believe in it that is in the Qur’ān and so for them will be Paradise; but he who disbelieves in it of the partisans namely all the disbelievers the Fire shall be his appointed place. So do not be in doubt in uncertainty concerning it concerning the Qur’ān. Truly it is the Truth from your Lord but most of mankind that is the people of Mecca do not believe."
  11,18,"And who that is none does greater wrong than he who invents a lie concerning God? by ascribing to Him partner and child. Those they shall be brought before their Lord on the Day of Resurrection amid the rest of creation and the witnesses ashhād is the plural of shāhid namely the angels who will bear witness that the messengers conveyed the Message and that the disbelievers denied them will say ‘These are they who lied concerning their Lord’. Surely the curse of God is upon the wrong-doers the idolaters;"
  11,19,"they who bar people from God’s way from the religion of Islam desiring to have it seeking that the way be crooked; and in the Hereafter they hum ‘they’ is reiterated for emphasis are disbelievers."
