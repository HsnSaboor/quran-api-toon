tafsir[7]{c,v,t}:
  2,135,"And they say ‘Be Jews or Christians the particle aw is for detail; the first of these is the saying of the Medinan Jews while the second is that of the Christians of Najrān and you shall be guided’. Say to them ‘Nay we follow rather the creed of Abraham a hanīf hanīfan is a circumstantial qualifier referring to Ibrāhīma that is to say one that inclines away from all other religions to the upright religion; and he was not of the idolaters’."
  2,136,"Say this address is to the believers ‘We believe in God and in that which has been revealed to us the Qur’ān and revealed to Abraham the ten scrolls Ishmael Isaac Jacob and the Tribes his sons and that which was given to Moses the Torah and Jesus the Gospel and the prophets from their Lord of Books and signs we make no division between any of them believing in some and disbelieving in others in the manner of Jews and Christians and to Him we submit’."
  2,137,"And if they the Jews and the Christians believe in the like mithl ‘the like’ is extra of what you believe in then they are truly guided; but if they turn away from belief in it then they are clearly in schism in opposition to you; God will suffice you O Muhammad (s) against them and their schisms; He is the Hearer of their sayings the Knower of their circumstances God sufficed him with regard to them by killing Qurayza expelling Nadīr and exacting the jizya from them."
  2,138,"The mark of God sibghata’Llāhi a verbal noun reaffirming the earlier āmannā and it is in the accusative because of the verbal construction implied that is to say sabaghanā’Llāhu ‘God has marked us’ this denotes His religion the one towards which He made human beings naturally inclined as it leaves its mark on a person in the same way that a dye leaves its mark on a garment; and who has that is none has a better mark sibghatan ‘marking’ is for specification than God? And Him we worship the Jews said to the Muslims ‘We are the people of the first Book and our direction of prayer qibla is more ancient and prophets were never sent from among the Arabs; if Muhammad were a prophet he would have been one of us’. Thus the following was revealed"
  2,139,"Say to them ‘Would you then dispute with us concerning God that He chose a prophet from among the Arabs and He is our Lord and your Lord? and so it is for Him to choose whom He will Our deeds belong to us for which we will be requited and to you belong your deeds for which you will be requited so that it is not improbable that among our deeds there will be those for which we will deserve to be honoured; and to Him we are sincerely devoted in religion and in deed unlike you hence we are more worthy to be chosen the hamza of a-tuhājjūnanā ‘would you then dispute’ is for rejection and the three clauses that follow it are all circumstantial qualifiers."
  2,140,"Or nay do you say taqūlūna also read yaqūlūna ‘do they say?’ ‘Abraham Ishmael Isaac and Jacob and the Tribes — they were Jews or they were Christians?’ Say to them ‘Have you then greater knowledge or has God? that is God has greater knowledge; He dissociated Abraham from both groups when He said Abraham was not a Jew nor a Christian Q. 367; and those mentioned with him Abraham are his followers in not belonging to either group. And who does greater injustice than he who conceals hides from people a testimony he has received from God? that is there is none more unjust than him these are the Jews for they concealed God’s testimony about Abraham’s pure faith in the Torah; And God is not heedless of what you do’ this is a threat for them."
  2,141,"That is a community that has passed away; theirs is what they have earned and yours is what you have earned; you shall not be asked about what they did a similar verse has already been mentioned above."
