But when a definitive sūra is revealed one in which nothing is abrogated naskh and fighting that is to say requirement for it is mentioned in it you see those in whose hearts is a sickness that is doubt — and they are the hypocrites — looking at you with the look of someone fainting at the point of death because of their fear of it and their aversion to it; in other words they fear fighting and are averse to it. Yet more fitting for them fa-awlā lahum is a subject the predicate of which is the following tā‘atun wa-qawlun ma‘rūfun"
  47,21,"would be to offer obedience and honourable words that is words that are kind to you. Then when the matter has been resolved upon that is to say when fighting has been prescribed if they are loyal to God in faith and obedience it will be better for them the sentence beginning with law ‘if’ constitutes the response to idhā ‘when’."
