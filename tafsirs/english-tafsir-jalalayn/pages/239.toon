  12,31,"And when she heard of their machinations their backbiting of her she sent for them and prepared for them a repast muttaka’ is food that requires cutting with a knife since one leans upon it ittikā’ this repast was utruj ‘citron’. She then gave each one of them a knife and said to Joseph ‘Come out before them!’ And when they saw him they were in awe of they exalted him and cut their hands with the knives without feeling any pain because their hearts were so engrossed by Joseph and they exclaimed ‘God preserve us! — in exaltation of him — This namely Joseph is no human being this is but a noble angel!’ on account of his all-encompassing beauty which is a characteristic not usually found among humankind. In the Sahīh of al-Bukhārī it is reported that one half of all beauty was given to him."

Indeed I did attempt to seduce him but he withheld himself he refused. Yet if he does not do what I bid him he verily shall be imprisoned and verily shall be of those brought low’ those abased.

  12,36,"And there entered the prison with him two youths two young men servants of the king one of whom was his cup-bearer the other his food-taster. They noticed that he interpreted dreams and so they said ‘Let us try him’. One of them the cup-bearer said ‘I dreamed that I was pressing wine’ that is grapes. The other the food-taster said ‘I dreamed that I was carrying on my head bread whereof the birds were eating. Tell us inform us of its interpretation for indeed we see you as being among the virtuous’."
  12,37,"He said to them both in order to inform them that he knew how to interpret dreams ‘The food with which you are provided shall not come to you while you are asleep but I shall tell you the interpretation thereof while you are conscious before it the interpretation thereof comes to you.
