tafsir[7]{c,v,t}:
  3,23,"Have you not seen those who were given a portion a share of the Book the Torah being called to the Book of God yud‘awna ‘being called’ is a circumstantial qualifier that it might decide between them and then a party of them turned away opposed? to the acceptance of its rulings. This was revealed concerning the Jews two of them fornicated and they the Jews asked the Prophet s to adjudicate the case. He ruled that they be stoned but they the Jews refused to do so. When the Torah was brought and consulted the same verdict was found and so the two were stoned but they the Jews became wrathful."
  3,24,"That turning away and rejection was because they said ‘the Fire shall not touch us except for a number of days’ that is for forty days only the length of time their forefathers worshipped the calf after which it would end; and the lies they used to invent in their saying this have deluded them in their religion wa-gharrahum fī dīnihim ‘it has deluded them in their religion’ is semantically connected to mā kānū yaftarūna ‘the lies which they used to invent’."
  3,25,"But how will it be their predicament when We gather them for a day that is to say on a day of which there is no doubt no uncertainty that is the Day of Resurrection; and every soul from among the People of the Scripture and others shall be paid in full the requital of what is has earned what it has done of good or evil and they that is people shall not be wronged? in that no good deed shall be diminished and no evil deed shall be increased."
  3,26,"When the Prophet s promised his community sovereignty over the lands of Persia and Byzantium the hypocrites said ‘How preposterous!’ and so the following was revealed Say ‘O God Master of the Kingdom you give the Kingdom to whom You will from among your creatures and seize the Kingdom from whom You will; You exalt whom You will by giving it the kingdom to him and You abase whom You will by seizing it from him; in Your hand in Your power is good that is as well as evil. You are Able to do all things."
  3,27,"You make the night to pass to enter into the day and You make the day to pass to enter into the night each of them increasing by the amount by which the other decreases; You bring forth the living from the dead such as humans and birds from sperm-drops and eggs respectively; and You bring forth the dead the sperm-drop and the egg from the living and You provide with abundant provision whom You will without reckoning’."
  3,28,"Let not the believers take the disbelievers as patrons rather than that is instead of the believers — for whoever does that that is whoever takes them as patrons does not belong to the religion of God in anyway — unless you protect yourselves against them as a safeguard tuqātan ‘as a safeguard’ is the verbal noun from taqiyyatan that is to say unless you fear something in which case you may show patronage to them through words but not in your hearts this was before the hegemony of Islam and the dispensation applies to any individual residing in a land with no say in it. God warns you He instills fear in you of His Self warning that He may be wrathful with you if you take them as patrons; and to God is the journey’s end the return and He will requite you."
  3,29,"Say to them ‘Whether you hide what is in your breasts in your hearts of patronage to them or disclose it manifest it God knows it and He knows what is in the heavens and what is in the earth; and God is Able to do all things and this includes punishing those who patronise them."
