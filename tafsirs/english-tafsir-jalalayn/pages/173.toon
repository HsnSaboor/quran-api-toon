tafsir[8]{c,v,t}:
  7,171,"And mention when We wrenched the mountain above them We lifted it up unearthing it from its root as if it were a canopy and they thought they were certain that it was about to fall upon them because of God’s threat to them that it would fall upon them if they refused to accept the rulings contained in the Torah they had initially refused to accept them because of their being burdensome but then accepted them and We said to them ‘Take firmly seriously and earnestly what We have given you and remember what is in it by acting in accordance with it that you might be God-fearing’."
  7,172,"And remember when your Lord took from the Children of Adam from their loins min zuhūrihim is an inclusive substitution for the preceding clause min banī Ādama ‘from the Children of Adam’ with the same preposition min ‘from’ their seed by bringing forth one from the loins of the other all from the loins of Adam offspring after offspring in the way that they multiply looking like small ants at the valley of Na‘mān on the Day of ‘Arafa because of their multitude. God set up proofs of His Lordship for them and endowed them with the faculty of reason and made them testify against themselves saying ‘Am I not your Lord?’ They said ‘Yea indeed You are our Lord we testify’ to this and this taking of testimony is lest they should say in both instances read third person yaqūlū ‘they say’ or second person taqūlū ‘you say’ on the Day of Resurrection ‘Truly of this Oneness of God we were unaware’ not knowing it!"
  7,173,"Or lest you should say ‘It is merely that our fathers were idolaters before that is before our time and we were descendants of theirs and so we followed their example. Will You then destroy us chastise us for that which those who follow falsehood did?’ from among our forefathers by their establishing idolatry? The meaning is they cannot use such arguments when they have been made to testify before their very selves to God’s Oneness. To effect this reminder by the tongue of the bearer of the miracle Muhammad (s) equally serves as a reminder for every soul to remember this within itself."
  7,174,"Thus We detail the signs We explain them even as We have explained the covenant that they might reflect on them and that they might revert from their disbelief."
  7,175,"And recite O Muhammad (s) to them that is the Jews the tidings the tale of him to whom We gave Our signs but he cast them off emerging in his disbelief in the same way that a snake emerges from its shed skin he rebelled in disbelief this was Bal‘am b. Bā‘ūrā’ a scholar from among the Children of Israel who had been given some knowledge of the Scriptures and who was asked by them to invoke God against Moses. And when he did the invocation turned against him and his tongue fell out onto his chest and Satan pursued him catching up with him and so he became his comrade and he became of the perverse."
  7,176,"And had We willed We would have raised him up to the ranks of the scholars thereby by facilitating his way to good deeds; but he was disposed to at peace in the earth — that is this world — and inclined to it and followed his whims by calling others to them and so We abased him. Therefore his likeness his description is as the likeness of a dog if you attack it by driving it away or curbing it it lolls its tongue out and if you leave it it lolls its tongue out and no other animal is like it in this way both conditional sentences constitute a circumstantial qualifier that is to say it has its tongue lolling out despicably in all circumstances. The purpose here is to point out the similarity between the one who follows his whims and a dog in terms of condition and vileness judging by the contextualising fā’ of fa-mathaluhu ‘therefore his likeness’ which relates what comes after it to what came before it in the way of ‘inclining towards this world and following whims’ and judging by God’s saying That likeness is the likeness of those people who deny Our signs. So recount the tale to the Jews that they might reflect upon it and so believe."
  7,177,"Evil as an example are the people evil is the example of the people who denied Our signs and were wont to wrong themselves through denial."
  7,178,"He whom God guides he is guided and he whom He sends astray — truly they are the losers."
