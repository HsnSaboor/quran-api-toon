tafsir[5]{c,v,t}:
  24,32,"And marry off the spouseless among you ayāmā is the plural form of ayyim namely a spouseless female whether she be a virgin or one previously married or a spouseless male this stipulation relates to free men and free women and the righteous ones the believers among your male slaves and your female slaves ‘ibād is one plural form of ‘abd. If they the free men are poor God will enrich them through marriage out of His bounty. God is Embracing of the needs of His creatures Knowing of them."
  24,33,"And let those who cannot find the means to marry be continent those who do not have the bridal money or the means for financial support needed for marriage let them restrain themselves from fornication until God enriches them until He improves their means out of His bounty and they marry. And those who seek a written contract of emancipation from among those whom your right hand owns of male slaves and female slaves contract with them accordingly if you know in them any good such as trustworthiness and the ability to earn income in order to fulfil the amount stated in the written contract which might be worded for example thus ‘I contract you for the amount of two thousand to be paid over a period of two months at one thousand a month and if you fulfill this you are a free man’ and the other would say ‘I accept’; and give them — this is a command for the slaves’ owners — out of the wealth of God which He has given you in the measure that will help them to fulfill their commitment to you the action of ītā’ ‘giving’ here suggests that some of the amount to which they have committed themselves should be waived. And do not compel your slave-girls your handmaidens to prostitution fornication when they desire to be chaste to abstain therefrom this ‘desire’ is the cause of the act of ‘compulsion’ so that the statement is not properly a conditional that you may seek through such compulsion the transient things of the life of this world — this was revealed regarding ‘Abd Allāh b. Ubayy who used to force his slave-girls to earn money through fornication. And should anyone compel them then surely God after their compulsion will be Forgiving to these slave-girls Merciful to them."
  24,34,"And verily We have revealed to you clear verses read mubayyanāt or mubayyināt in this sūra verses in which if read mubayyanāt what is mentioned is already clear or which if read mubayyināt are clarificatory of that which is mentioned and an example a curious tale namely that of ‘Ā’isha of those who passed away before you that is to say of their kind of example that is an example of their curious tales such as the tales of Joseph and Mary and an admonition for those who fear God in what He exalted be He has said And do not let any pity for them overcome you in God’s religion verse 2 above; and Why when you first heard about it did the believing men and women not think good of themselves… to the end of verse 12 above; and And why when you heard it did you not say … to the end of verse 16 above; and God admonishes you lest you should ever repeat the like of it … to the end of verse 17 above. This admonition is specifically for ‘those who fear God’ because they are the ones to benefit from such an admonition."
  24,35,"God is the Light of the heavens and the earth in other words He illumines both of them with the sun and the moon. The likeness of His Light that is the description of it as it resides in the heart of a believer is as a niche wherein is a lamp. The lamp is in a glass — this glass is the case for the lantern and the misbāh is the torch that is the wick that is lit; al-mishkāt is a recess that does not penetrate to the other side in other words the tube inside the lantern the glass with the light inside it is as it were a glittering star that is a light-giving star read dirrī’un or durrī’un derived from al-dar‘ ‘to repel’ because it repels darkness; or read durriyyun derived from al-durr ‘pearls’ kindled is this lamp read past tense tawaqqada; a variant reading has the imperfect tense of awqada in the passive voice yūqadu; another reading has tūqadu in which case the reference is to al-zujāja ‘the glass’ from the oil of a Blessed Tree an olive neither of the east nor of the west but in between the two so that no harmful cold or heat affects it; whose oil would almost glow forth of itself though no fire touched it because of the extent of its purity. Light by Him upon light by fire; the light of God is His guidance of the believer light upon the light of faith. God guides to His Light that is to the religion of Islam whom He will. And God strikes He illustrates similitudes for men by approximating such similitudes to their comprehension so that they might take heed and believe; and God is Knower of all things including knowledge of how to strike similitudes."
  24,36,"In houses fī buyūtin is semantically connected to yusabbihu ‘glorify’ that will follow whose status God has allowed to be raised houses He has allowed to be venerated and wherein His Name is remembered through the affirmation of His Oneness therein they make glorifications read yusabbahu ‘glorifications are made’ or yusabbihu meaning ‘therein pray’ to Him in the mornings al-ghuduww is a verbal noun meaning al-ghadawāt ‘the early mornings’ and the evenings the darkness after sunset"
