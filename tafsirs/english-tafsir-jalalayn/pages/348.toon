  23,90,"Nay but We have brought them the truth veracity and they are indeed liars in rejecting it namely the truth of the following"
  23,91,"God has not taken any son nor is there any god along with Him; for then that is if there were a god along with Him each god would have taken away what he created he would have made it exclusively his and prevented the other god from having any mastery over it; and some of them would surely rise up against others in challenge just as the kings of this world are wont to do. Glorified be God — an exaltation of Him — above what they ascribe to Him of what has been mentioned."
  23,92,"Knower of the Unseen and the visible what is hidden and what is observed if read in the genitive ‘ālimi’l-ghaybi ‘Knower of the Unseen’ this is an adjectival qualification; if in the nominative ‘ālimu’l-ghaybi ‘the Knower of the Unseen this would be the predicate of an implied preceding huwa ‘He is’ and exalted magnified be He above what they associate! with Him of partners."

  23,98,"And I seek protection in You my Lord lest they visit me’ in any of my affairs for they only visit to bring ill."
