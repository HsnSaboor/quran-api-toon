tafsir[8]{c,v,t}:
  33,36,"And it is not fitting for any believing man or believing woman when God and His Messenger have decided on a matter to have read takūna or yakūna a choice in their matter in contravention of the decision of God and His Messenger. This verse was revealed regarding ‘Abd Allāh b. Jahsh and his sister Zaynab whose hand the Prophet had asked for in marriage but meaning on behalf of Zayd b. Hāritha. They were loathe to this proposal when they found out that it was on the latter’s behalf for they had thought that the Prophet s wanted to marry her himself. But afterwards they consented because of the following part of the verse And whoever disobeys God and His Messenger has certainly strayed into manifest error. Thus the Prophet s gave her in marriage to Zayd. Then on one occasion he the Prophet caught sight of her and felt love for her whereafter when he realised that Zayd lost his affection for her and so said to the Prophet s ‘I want to part with her’. But the Prophet said to him ‘Retain your wife for yourself’ as God exalted be He says"
  33,37,"And when idh is dependent because of an implied preceding udhkur ‘mention when’ you said to him to whom God had shown favour by guiding him to Islam and to whom you too had shown favour by manumitting him — this was Zayd b. Hāritha who had been a prisoner of war before the coming of Islam in the period of al-jāhiliyya. The Messenger of God s purchased him before his call to prophethood and then manumitted him and adopted him as his son — ‘Retain your wife for yourself and fear God’ before divorcing her. But you had hidden in your heart what God was to disclose what He was to manifest of your love for her and of the fact that should Zayd part with her you would marry her and you feared people would say ‘He has married his son’s wife!’ though God is worthier that you should fear Him in all things so take her in marriage and do not be concerned with what people say. Zayd subsequently divorced her and her obligatory waiting period was completed. God exalted be He says So when Zayd had fulfilled whatever need he had of her We joined her in marriage to you — the Prophet consummated his marriage with her without the customary permission from her legal guardian and gratified the Muslims with a feast of bread and meat — so that there may not be any restriction for the believers in respect of the wives of their adopted sons when the latter have fulfilled whatever wish they have of them. And God’s commandment that which He has decreed is bound to be realised."
  33,38,"There is no restriction for the Prophet in what God has ordained in what He has made lawful for him that is God’s precedent sunnata’Llāhi is in the accusative because the operator of the oblique has been removed from the oblique construction ka-sunnati’Llāhi ‘as is God’s precedent’ with those who passed away before of prophets which is that there is no restriction for them in this respect a special dispensation for them regarding marriage — and God’s commandment what He does is inexorable destiny"
  33,39,"— those who alladhīna qualifies the previous alladhīna deliver the Messages of God and fear Him and fear no one except Him and therefore they do not fear what people might say about that which God has made lawful for them. And God suffices as Reckoner as keeper of the deeds of His creatures and as One to reckon with them."
  33,40,"Muhammad is not the father of any man among you he is not Zayd’s biological father and so it is not unlawful for him to marry his former wife Zaynab after him; but he is the Messenger of God and the Seal of the Prophets and so he will not have a son that is a fully grown man to be a prophet after him a variant reading for khātim al-nabiyyīna has khātam al-nabiyyīn as in the instrument known as a ‘seal’ in other words their prophethood has been sealed by him. And God has knowledge of all things among these is the fact that there will be no prophet after him and even when the lord Jesus descends at the end of days he will rule according to his Muhammad’s Law."
  33,41,"O you who believe! Remember God with much remembrance."
  33,42,"And glorify Him morning and evening in other words at the beginning of the day and at the end of it."
  33,43,"It is He Who blesses you that is to say Who shows mercy to you and His angels ask forgiveness for you that He may bring you forth that He may always bring you forth from darkness namely from disbelief into light namely faith. And He is Merciful to the believers."
