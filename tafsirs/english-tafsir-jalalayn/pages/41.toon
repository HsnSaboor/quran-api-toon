tafsir[4]{c,v,t}:
  2,249,"And when Saul went forth with the hosts from the Holy House sc. Jerusalem the heat was intense and so they asked him for water; he said ‘God will try test you in order to distinguish the obedient among you from the disobedient with a river between Jordan and Palestine whoever drinks of it of its water is not of me is not of my followers and whoever tastes it not he is of me except for him who scoops up with his hand’ ghurfa or gharfa ‘a scoop’ satisfying himself therewith and not taking more he is also of my followers. But they drank of it when they reached it and saw that it was abundant except a few of them who restricted themselves to a scoop it is reported that one scoop was enough for each man and his horse and they numbered over three hundred; and when he crossed it with those who believed the ones who confined themselves to the one scoop they the ones that drank profusely said ‘We have no power today against Goliath and his troops’ that is no power to fight them and they were cowardly and did not cross it. Those who thought with certainty that they would meet God at the Resurrection and these were the ones that crossed it said ‘How often kam ‘how’ functions as a predicate meaning kathīr ‘many’ a little company group of men has overcome a numerous one by God’s leave by His will; and God is with the patient’ providing them with help and assistance."
  2,250,"So when they went forth against Goliath and his troops facing them in military columns they said ‘Our Lord pour out upon us patience and make firm our feet by strengthening our hearts for this struggle and grant us victory over the disbelieving folk!’"
  2,251,"And they routed they broke them by the leave of God by His will and David who was among the ranks of Saul’s army slew Goliath; and God gave him David the kingship over the Children of Israel and Wisdom prophethood after the death of Samuel and Saul and the combination of kingship and prophethood had never come to anyone before him; and He taught him such as He willed of the manufacture of mail-coats and the speech of birds. Had God not repelled people some ba‘dahum ‘some’ substitutes for saying ba‘dan min al-nās ‘some people’ by means of others the earth would have surely been corrupted with idolaters defeating and slaying Muslims and mosques being destroyed; but God is bounteous to all worlds by repelling some by means of others."
  2,252,"These verses are the verses of God We recite to you O Muhammad (s) as narration in truth and assuredly you are one of the Messengers of God the emphasis is made here with the particle inna of innaka ‘surely you are’ with the remainder of the statement being a rebuttal of the disbelievers’ saying ‘You are no Messenger’."
