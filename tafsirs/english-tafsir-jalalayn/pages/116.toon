tafsir[5]{c,v,t}:
  5,46,"And We caused Jesus son of Mary to follow in their that is the prophets’ footsteps confirming the Torah before him; and We gave to him the Gospel wherein is guidance from error and light an exposition of the rulings confirming musaddiqan is a circumstantial qualifier the Torah before it the rulings contained therein and as a guidance and an admonition to the God-fearing."
  5,47,"We said So let the People of the Gospel judge according to what God has revealed therein of rulings a variant reading of wa’l-yahkum ‘let them judge’ is wa-li-yahkuma making it a supplement to that which is governed by the previous verb ātaynāhu ‘We gave to him’. Whoever does not judge according to what God has revealed — those are the wicked."
  5,48,"And We have revealed to you O Muhammad (s) the Book the Qur’ān with the truth bi’l-haqq is semantically connected to anzalnā ‘We have revealed’ confirming the Book that was before it and watching over it testifying to it — the ‘Book’ means the Scriptures. So judge between them between the People of the Scripture if they take their cases before you according to what God has revealed to you and do not follow their whims deviating away from the truth that has come to you. To every one of you O communities We have appointed a divine law and a way a clear path in religion for them to proceed along. If God had willed He would have made you one community following one Law but He separated you one from the other that He may try you in what He has given to you of the differing Laws in order to see who among you is obedient and who is disobedient. So vie with one another in good works strive hastily thereunto; to God you shall all return through resurrection and He will then inform you of that in which you differed in the matter of religion and requite each of you according to his deeds."
  5,49,"And judge between them according to what God has revealed and do not follow their whims and beware of them lest they seduce you lest they lead you astray from part of what God has revealed to you. But if they turn away from the judgement revealed and desire some other then know that God desires to smite them with punishment in this world for some of their sins those which they have committed among them their turning away and that He desires to requite them for all of their sins in the Hereafter; surely many of mankind are wicked."
  5,50,"Do they desire yabghūn is also read tabghūn ‘do you desire?’ do they seek the judgement of paganism through their deceit and deviation when they turn away? this is an interrogative meant as a disavowal. Yet who that is no one is better in judgement than God for a people knowing Him with certainty? These people are singled out for mention because they are the ones who reflect."
