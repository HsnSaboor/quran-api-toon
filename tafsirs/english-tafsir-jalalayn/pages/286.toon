  17,40,"Has your Lord then preferred you has He distinguished you exclusively O Meccans with sons and chosen for Himself females from among the angels? as daughters for Himself in the way that you are wont to claim. Truly by saying this you are speaking a monstrous word!"
  17,41,"And verily We have dispensed We have elucidated in this Qur’ān similitudes promises of reward and threats of retribution so that they may remember that they may be admonished but it that elucidation only increases them in aversion to the Truth."

  17,43,"Glory be to Him — an affirmation of His transcendence — and exalted be He above what they say in the way of His having associates greatly!"
  17,44,"The seven heavens and the earth and all that is therein proclaim His praise they affirm His transcendence. And there is not a thing among things created but proclaims enwrapped in His praise in other words everything says subhāna’Llāh wa-bi-hamdihi ‘Glory and praise be to God’; but you do not understand their glorification because it is not proclaimed in your language.
