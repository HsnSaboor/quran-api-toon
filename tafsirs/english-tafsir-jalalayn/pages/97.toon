  4,114,"There is no good in much of their that is of people’s secret conversations that is what they converse and talk secretly about except for the secret talk of he who enjoins to voluntary almsgiving or kindness a righteous deed or setting things right between people. And whoever does that the aforementioned desiring seeking God’s good pleasure and nothing else of the affairs of this world We shall surely give him read nu’tīhi or yu’tīhi ‘He will give him’ that is ‘God will give him’ a great wage."
  4,115,"But whoever makes a breach with whoever opposes the Messenger in the truth that he brings after guidance has become clear to him after the truth has become manifest to him through miracles and follows a path other than the way of the believers that is to say other than the path they follow in religion by disbelieving We shall turn him over to what he has turned to We shall make him a leader of the misguidance which he has followed by leaving this as it is between them in this world and We shall expose him We shall admit him in the Hereafter in Hell where he will burn — an evil journey’s end an evil return it is."

And surely I will command them and they will change God’s creation’ substituting His religion with unbelief making lawful what God has made unlawful and making unlawful what God has made lawful. And whoever takes Satan for a patron following him and obeying him instead of God has surely suffered a manifest loss one that is evident since he will end up in the Fire made perpetual for him."
