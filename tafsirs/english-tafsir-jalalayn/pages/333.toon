tafsir[10]{c,v,t}:
  22,6,"That which is mentioned from the commencement of man’s creation to the end of the description of the earth being revived is because God He is the Truth the Constant the Permanent and because He revives the dead and has power over all things;"
  22,7,"and because the Hour will come whereof there is no doubt uncertainty; and because God will resurrect those who are in the graves."
  22,8,"The following was revealed regarding Abū Jahl And among mankind there are some who dispute about God without any knowledge or guidance being with him or an enlightening Scripture one containing light being with him"
  22,9,"turning aside thāniya ‘itfihi a circumstantial qualifier meaning ‘turning his neck aside in disdain of belief; al-ītf means ‘a side’ and can be either the left or the right to go astray read li-yadilla; or li-yudilla ‘to lead others astray’ from the way of God that is from His religion. For him there will be ignominy chastisement in this world — thus he Abū Jahl was slain on the day of Badr — and on the Day of Resurrection We shall make him taste the chastisement of the burning that is the chastisement of being burnt in the Fire and it shall be said to him"
  22,10,"‘That is the chastisement for what your hands have sent ahead in other words what you have offered in the way of deeds — He refers to him with reference to the two hands as opposed to other parts because most actions are effected through them — and because God is not unjust to His servants’ chastising them without their having committed any sin."
  22,11,"And among mankind there are those who worship God on a knife-edge that is with uncertainty in his worship — such a person has been likened the knife- edge of a mountain in his precariousness — if good fortune befalls him so that he enjoys health and security with respect to his own self and his property he is reassured by it; but if an ordeal befalls him a trial or ill-health with regard to himself or his property he makes a turnabout that is he reverts to disbelief losing both this world when what he had hoped for in it has eluded him and the Hereafter by his disbelief. That is the manifest loss."
  22,12,"He calls on he worships besides God in the way of idols that which could not hurt him should he refrain from worshipping it and that which could not profit him if were to worship it. Such a call is extreme error from the truth."
  22,13,"He calls on him the lām of la-man is extra whose harm when worshipped is likelier than his benefit even if he were to have any benefit as he imagines him to have. Truly an evil patron is he that is an evil helper and an evil friend an evil companion is he. After the mention of ‘the doubter’ and his being in manifest ‘loss’ above verse 11 there follows the mention of the believers and their reward as follows"
  22,14,"Truly God shall admit those who believe and perform righteous deeds in the way of obligatory and supererogatory acts of worship into gardens underneath which rivers flow. Indeed God does whatever He desires in the way of showing beneficence to those who obey Him and degrading those who disobey Him."
  22,15,"Whoever supposes that God will not help him namely Muhammad (s) His Prophet in this world and the Hereafter let him extend a rope to the ceiling to the roof of his house fixing it there and tying it to his neck and let him hang himself that is let him choke to death because of it by severing his soul from any existence on the earth as reported in the various Sahīh compilations. Then let him see whether his strategy against the Prophet being helped dispels that which enrages him about it. In other words let him choke to death with rage because of it for it is inevitable."
