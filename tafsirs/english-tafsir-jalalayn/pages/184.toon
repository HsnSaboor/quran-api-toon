tafsir[9]{c,v,t}:
  8,53,"That chastisement of the disbelievers is because God would never change a grace that He had conferred on a people substituting it with affliction until they have changed that which is in themselves until they have exchanged the grace conferred upon them for unbelief in the way that the Meccan disbelievers exchanged their being ‘fed against hunger’ their being made ‘safe from fear’ cf. Q. 1064 and the sending of the Prophet s to them for unbelief for barring against the way of God and for fighting Muslims; and know that God is Hearing Knowing."
  8,54,"Like the way of Pharaoh’s folk and those before them they denied the signs of their Lord so We destroyed them for their sins and We drowned the folk of Pharaoh his people together with him and all disbelieving communities were evildoers."
  8,55,"The following was revealed regarding Banū Qurayza Surely the worst of beasts in God’s sight are the ungrateful who will not believe"
  8,56,"those of them with whom you have made a pact not to support the idolaters and then break their pact every time they conclude one and they are not fearful of God in their treachery."
  8,57,"So if fa-immā here the letter nūn of the conditional particle in ‘if’ has been assimilated with the extra mā you come upon them if you find them anywhere in the war deal with them so as to cause those fighters behind them to scatter to disperse by making an example of them and punishing them so that they the ones behind them might remember that they might take heed from their example."
  8,58,"And if you fear from any folk who have concluded a pact with you some treachery in a pact through some indication that comes to you then cast it back to them dissolve their pact with fairness ‘alā sawā’ is a circumstantial qualifier that is to say while you and they have equal knowledge that the pact has been broken by your apprising them thereof lest they accuse you of treachery. Truly God does not love the treacherous."
  8,59,"The following was revealed regarding those who escaped capture on the day of Badr And do not O Muhammad (s) let those who disbelieve suppose that they have outstripped God that is that they have eluded Him indeed they cannot escape they cannot elude Him a variant reading has wa-lā yahsabanna ‘and do not let them suppose’ so that the first direct object is omitted actually being an implied anfusahum ‘themselves’ sc. ‘and do not let them suppose themselves to have outstripped’; and according to another variant reading anna is read instead of inna with an implicit lām sc. ‘because they cannot escape’."
  8,60,"Make ready for them for fighting them whatever force you can the Prophet s said that this refers to ‘archers’ as reported by Muslim and of horses tethered ribāt is a verbal noun meaning ‘restraining them for use in the way of God’ that thereby you may dismay terrify the enemy of God and your enemy namely the disbelievers of Mecca and others besides them that is other than those — namely the hypocrites or the Jews whom you know not God knows them. And whatever thing you expend in the way of God its requital shall be repaid to you in full and you will not be wronged you will not be diminished anything thereof."
  8,61,"And if they incline to peace read silm or salm meaning ‘settlement’ then incline to it and conclude a pact with them Ibn ‘Abbās said ‘This has been abrogated by the “sword verse” Q. 95’; Mujāhid said ‘This stipulation applies exclusively in the context of the People of the Scripture for it was revealed regarding the Banū Qurayza; and rely on God put your trust in Him; truly He is the Hearer of words the Knower of actions."
