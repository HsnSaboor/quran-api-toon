tafsir[18]{c,v,t}:
  52,32,"Or do their faculties of understanding prompt them to say this? their saying to him you are either a sorcerer a poet a soothsayer or a madman in other words they do not in reality prompt them to say this. Or am in effect means bal ‘rather’ are they a rebellious lot? because of their obstinacy."
  52,33,"Or do they say ‘He has improvised it?’ he has concocted the Qur’ān. He has not concocted it; Rather they do not believe out of arrogance. If they continue to say that he has concocted it"
  52,34,"Then let them bring a concocted discourse like it if they are truthful in what they say."
  52,35,"Or were they created out of nothing? that is without a Creator. Or are they the creators? of themselves. It makes no sense for a created thing to have no creator nor can a thing that will cease to existent have the power to create. There must be a Creator of them and that is God the One so why do they not affirm His Oneness and believe in His Messenger and His Book?"
  52,36,"Or did they create the heavens and the earth? Nor can any but God the Creator have created them so why do they not worship Him? Nay but they are not certain of Him for otherwise they would have believed in His Prophet."
  52,37,"Or do they possess the treasuries of your Lord? in the way of prophethood provision and other matters so that they are able to assign what they will exclusively to whom they will? Or are they the ones in control? or are they the mighty ones who hold sway? the verb from musaytirūna is saytara similar in root form to baytara ‘to practice veterinary medicine’ or bayqara ‘to corrupt’ ‘to ruin’."
  52,38,"Or do they have a ladder a means of ascension into the heaven whereby they eavesdrop? that is at the top of which they listen in on the conversations of the angels so that they are then able to dispute with the Prophet as they claim. If that is what they assert Then let their eavesdropper let the one claiming to be able to listen in on their conversations on top of this ladder produce a manifest warrant a plain and evident proof. Now on account of the similarity of this assertion to their assertion that the angels are the daughters of God He exalted be He says"
  52,39,"Or does He have daughters as you claim whereas you have sons? Exalted be God above what you claim!"
  52,40,"Or are you asking them for a fee a wage in return for what you have brought them in the way of religion so that they are weighed down with debt? with the liability for this so that they are unable to submit to God."
  52,41,"Or do they have access to the Unseen that is the knowledge of it so that they can write it down? and are hence able to dispute with the Prophet s regarding the Resurrection and the matters relating to the Hereafter as they claim."
  52,42,"Or do they desire to outmanoeuvre? you and have you killed at the Assembly Council. But those who disbelieve they are the outmanoeuvred ones! the vanquished and the ones destroyed. God preserved him from them and then destroyed them at Badr."
  52,43,"Or do they have a god other than God? Glory be to God exalted is He above any partners that they may ascribe! to Him in the way of gods the succession of interrogatives with am ‘or’ are intended to express censure and rebuke."
  52,44,"And if they were to see a fragment a portion of the heaven falling on them — as they say Then make fragments of the heaven fall upon us Q. 26187 as a chastisement for them — they would say this is ‘A heap of clouds!’ piled on top of one another that will bring us water; and so they do not believe."
  52,45,"So leave them until they encounter that day of theirs in which they will be thunderstruck in which they will die;"
  52,46,"the day when their guile will avail them nothing yawma lā yughnī is a substitution for yawmahumu ‘that day of theirs’ and they will not be helped they will not be protected from the chastisement in the Hereafter."
  52,47,"And assuredly for those who do wrong by their persistence in disbelief there is a chastisement beyond that in this world before their death — thus they were punished with famine and drought for seven years and with being killed on the day of Badr; but most of them do not know that the chastisement will befall them."
  52,48,"And submit patiently to the judgement of your Lord that they be reprieved and do not be grieved for surely you fare before Our eyes you are in Our sight We see you and preserve you. And glorify continuously with praise of your Lord that is to say say subhāna’Llāhi wa bi-hamdihi ‘Glory and praise be to God!’ when you rise from your sleeping-place or your sitting-place"
  52,49,"and glorify Him at night — also in actual utterance — and at the receding of the stars idbāra is a verbal noun that is to say also glorify Him after these have set; or it means in the case of the former perform the two evening prayers and in the case of the latter the two units rak‘a of the dawn prayer or — it is said — the morning prayer."
