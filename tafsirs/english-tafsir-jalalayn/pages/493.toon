  43,48,"And We never showed them a sign from among the signs of chastisement such as the flood which was when the waters of the Nile penetrated their dwellings and for seven days rose as high as their throats as they sat or the chastisement of the locusts but it was greater than the one before it the one immediately preceding it. And We seized them with chastisement that perhaps they might recant their disbelief."
  43,49,"And they said to Moses upon seeing the chastisement ‘O sorcerer! — that is to say ‘O knowledgeable perfect one’ since for them sorcery was an awesome form of knowledge — supplicate your Lord for us by the covenant that He has made with you to the effect that He would relieve us from chastisement if we believe. Assuredly we will be guided’ that is to say we will become believers."

  43,51,"And Pharaoh proclaimed boastfully among his people ‘O my people does not the kingdom of Egypt belong to me and these rivers of the Nile flowing beneath me? that is to say beneath my palaces. Do you not perceive? my magnificence."
  43,52,"Or do you perceive in which case am I not better than this one namely Moses who is contemptible feeble and lowly and who can scarcely speak clearly? who can scarcely articulate his speech because of his lisp — which was the result of his accidentally placing a hot coal in his mouth when he was a child."
  43,53,"Why then if he were being truthful have bracelets of gold asāwira is the plural of aswira which is the plural of siwār similar in pattern to ghurāb aghriba not been cast on him — as according to their custom with those whom they made their leaders dressing them with gold bracelets and gold necklaces — or the angels not come with him one after the other?’ in succession to testify to his truthfulness."
  43,54,"Thus did he Pharaoh persuade incite his people and they obeyed him in his wish that Moses be denied. They were truly an immoral folk."

  43,56,"And We made them a thing past salaf is the plural of sālif similar in pattern to khādim khadam that is to say a precedent as a lesson and an example for others after them that they posterity might take their predicament as a lesson and so not engage in actions similar to theirs."

  43,58,"And they say ‘Are our gods better or he?’ Jesus. We are satisfied that our gods be in the same predicament with him. They only cite this that is the example to you for the sake of contention merely arguing with falsehood for they know that the particle mā of wa-mā ta‘budūna ‘and what you worship’ refers only to non-rational beings and cannot therefore include Jesus peace be upon him. Nay but they are a contentious lot an extremely disputatious folk."
  43,59,"He Jesus is only a servant of Ours on whom We bestowed favour through prophethood and We made him by his coming into being without a father an exemplar for the Children of Israel that is to say like an example because of the wondrousness of his case one from which one is able to infer God’s power exalted be He to do whatever He will."
