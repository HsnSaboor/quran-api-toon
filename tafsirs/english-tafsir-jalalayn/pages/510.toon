  47,31,"And We will assuredly try you We will assuredly test you by way of commanding you to participate in the struggle and in other ways until We know with knowledge outwardly manifested those of you who struggle for God’s cause and those who are steadfast in adhering to the struggle and in other ways and We will appraise We will reveal your record in terms of whether you acted with obedience or disobedience in what concerns the struggle all three verbs may be read with the third person singular yā’ or with the first person plural nūn."
  47,32,"Indeed those who disbelieve and bar from the way of God the path of truth and defy the Messenger opposing him after the guidance this is the meaning of ‘the way of God’ has become clear to them they will not hurt God in any way and He will make their works fail He will invalidate them good works such as voluntary alms and the like and so they will not find any reward for it in the Hereafter — this was revealed either regarding those Meccan participants at the battle of Badr who provided food for the needy or regarding the Jewish tribes of Qurayza and al-Nadīr."
  47,33,"O you who believe! Obey God and obey the Messenger and do not render your own works void by engaging in acts of disobedience for example."
  47,34,"Indeed those who disbelieve and bar from the way of God His path namely guidance and then die as disbelievers God will never forgive them — this was revealed regarding the men of the Well al-qalīb."

  47,38,"Lo! there you are O those who are being called to expend in the way of God that which has been prescribed for you; yet among you there are those who are niggardly; and whoever is niggardly is niggardly only to his own soul one may say bakhila ‘alayhi or bakhila ‘anhu to mean ‘he was niggardly to someone’. For God is the Independent One without need of your expending; while you are the needy of Him. And if you turn away from obedience to Him He will replace you with another people that is to say He will bring them in your place and they will not be the likes of you in turning away from obedience to Him but they will be obedient to Him Mighty and Majestic is He."
