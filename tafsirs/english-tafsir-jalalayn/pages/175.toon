tafsir[8]{c,v,t}:
  7,188,"Say ‘I have no power to bring benefit to attract it to myself or hurt to repel it except as God wills. Had I knowledge of the Unseen — that which is hidden from me I would have acquired much good and adversity in the way of impoverishment and otherwise would not touch me since I would take precautions against such adversity by avoiding what is harmful. I am but a warner to disbelievers of the Fire and a bearer of good tidings of Paradise to a people who believe’."
  7,189,"He that is God it is Who created you from a single soul namely Adam and made created from him his spouse Eve that he might take rest in her and become intimate with her. Then when he covered her when he had sexual intercourse with her she bore a light burden namely the sperm-drop and moved to and fro with it that is she came and went easily on account of its lightness; but when she became heavy because of the child growing inside her and they became anxious that it should be a dumb child they cried to God their Lord ‘If You give us one a child that is sound unimpaired we indeed shall be of the thankful’ to You for it."
  7,190,"But when He gave them a sound one a sound child they ascribed to Him associates shurakā’a a variant reading has shirkan meaning sharīkan ‘an associate’ in that which He had given them by naming it ‘Abd al-Hārith ‘servant of al-Hārith’ when it is not right to be a ‘servant’ ‘abd of any one but ‘God’ sc. ‘Abd Allāh but this namesake ‘Abd is not an association of another with God in terms of servitude for Adam was immune from a sin such as associating others in worship with God. Samura b. Jundub reported that the Prophet s said ‘On one occasion when Eve gave birth — all the children she bore had failed to survive — Satan visited her and said to her “Name it the child ‘Abd al-Hārith and it will live.” She named it so and it lived. This affair was the result of Satan’s inspiration and his doings’ reported by al-Hākim who deemed it the report ‘sound’ sahīh and also reported by al-Tirmidhī who considered it ‘fair-uncommon’ hasan gharīb; but exalted is God above what they the people of Mecca associate in the way of idols this sentence is consequent a supplement to the one beginning with khalaqakum ‘He created you’ so that what comes between the two is a parenthetical statement."
  7,191,"Do they associate with Him in worship those who cannot create anything but are themselves created"
  7,192,"and who are not able to give them that is those who worship them any help nor can they help themselves? by defending themselves against someone intending to damage them by breaking them or otherwise the interrogative is meant as a rebuke."
  7,193,"And if you call them that is the idols to guidance they will not follow you read yatba‘ūkum or yattabi‘ūkum. It will be the same response for you whether you call them to it or whether you are silent refraining from calling them they will not follow it because they cannot hear."
  7,194,"Truly those on whom you call whom you worship besides God are servants owned like you; call them then and let them answer you your call if you are truthful in claiming that they are gods God then illustrates their utter incapacity and the superiority which their worshippers possess over them saying"
  7,195,"Have they feet wherewith they walk or indeed have they hands aydin is the plural of yad wherewith they can grasp or indeed have they eyes wherewith they can see or indeed have they ears wherewith they give ear? an interrogative of rejection in other words they have none of these things which you have so why do you worship them when you are more complete in being than they are? Say to them O Muhammad (s) ‘Call upon your associates to destroy me; then scheme against me and waste no time do not give me any respite for I am not concerned with you."
