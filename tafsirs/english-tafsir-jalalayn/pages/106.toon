tafsir[3]{c,v,t}:
  4,176,"They will ask you for a pronouncement concerning indirect heirs. Say ‘God pronounces to you concerning indirect heirs. If a man in imru’un is in the nominative because of the verb halaka ‘perishes’ that explains it perishes dies having no children and no parent and this is the one referred to as an indirect heir kalāla but he has a sister from both parents or from one hers is half of what he leaves and he a brother similarly is her heir in all that she leaves if she has no children but if she has a son then he the maternal uncle receives nothing and if a daughter then whatever is left after her share; if the brother and sister be from the same mother then the one receives a sixth as was stipulated at the beginning of the sūra Q. 411. If there be two sisters or more — for this was revealed regarding Jābir b. ‘Abd Allāh who died and was survived by sisters — theirs are two-thirds of what he the brother leaves; if there be among the inheritors siblings men and women then the male among them shall receive the equivalent of the portion of two females. God makes clear to you the stipulations of your religion lest you go astray; and God has knowledge of all things’ including matters of inheritance it is reported by the two Shaykhs Bukhārī and Muslim that al-Barā’ b. ‘Āzib said that this was the last of the ‘duty’ verses to be revealed."
  5,1,"O you who believe fulfil your bonds the covenants confirmed between you and God and between you and other people. Lawful to you is the beast of the flocks camels cattle and sheep and goats to eat after slaughtering them except that which is now being recited to you as forbidden in the verse below Forbidden to you are carrion…Q. 53; the exceptive clause here is a discontinuous one but may also be continuous; the forbidding concerns that which has succumbed to death and the like; game not being lawful to you when you are on pilgrimage hurum means muhrimūn; ghayra ‘not’ is in the accusative as it introduces a circumstantial qualifier referring to the subject of the pronoun lakum ‘to you’. Verily God decrees whatever He desires in the way of making things lawful or otherwise and there can be no objection thereto."
  5,2,"O you who believe do not profane God’s sacraments sha‘ā’ir is the plural of sha‘īra that is the ritual ceremonies of the religion by hunting game while you are on pilgrimage nor the sacred month by fighting in it nor the offering that is the boon offered in the Meccan Sanctuary by interfering with it nor the garlands qalā’id is the plural of qilāda and these made from the trees around the Sanctuary were placed around it the offering to protect it in other words do not interfere with these offerings or with those who place them; nor violate the sanctity of those repairing those heading to the Sacred House by fighting them who are seeking bounty provision from their Lord through commerce and His beatitude by resorting to Him as they the Meccans pagans falsely claimed this was abrogated by the barā’a verse of sūrat al-Tawba Q. 94. But when you are discharged from pilgrimage inviolability then hunt for game a command denoting permission. And let not hatred read shana’ānu or shan’ānu of a people that because they barred you from the Sacred Mosque cause you to commit aggression against them by killing them or otherwise. Help one another to righteousness by doing that to which you were enjoined and piety by refraining from what you have been forbidden; do not help one another ta‘āwanū one of the two original tā’ letters in tata‘āwanū has been omitted to sin acts of disobedience and enmity transgression of God’s bounds. And fear God fear His punishment by being obedient to Him; surely God is severe in retribution against those that oppose Him."
