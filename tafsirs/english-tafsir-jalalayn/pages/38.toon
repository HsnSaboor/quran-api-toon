tafsir[4]{c,v,t}:
  2,234,"And those of you who pass away die leaving behind wives they shall wait by themselves after their death refraining from marriage for four months and ten nights this applies to women who are not pregnant. The waiting period in the case of pregnant women is for them to give birth — as stated by a verse in sūrat al-Talāq Q. 654. The slavegirl must wait for half this period of four months according to the Sunna; when they have reached completed their term of waiting then you would not be at fault O guardians regarding what they may do with themselves in the way of adorning themselves and offering themselves before suitors honourably in accordance with the Law; God is aware of what you do both secretly and openly."
  2,235,"You would not be at fault regarding the proposal with the intention of marriage you present offer or hide in your hearts during the waiting period to women whose spouses have died such as men saying ‘How beautiful you are!’ or ‘Who could find one like you?’ or ‘How many a man must desire you!’. God knows that you will be mindful of them in proposing to them impatiently and so He has permitted you to make such offers; but do not make arrangements of marriage with them secretly unless you speak honourable words such as are acknowledged by the Law in other words such as proposals that which is permitted to you. And do not resolve on the knot the consummation of marriage until that which is written the period prescribed has reached its term and has been completed; and know that God knows what is in your souls of resolve or otherwise; so be fearful of Him that He should chastise you if you have made such resolve; and know that God is Forgiving toward him who is fearful of Him Forbearing in delaying the chastisement of the one deserving it."
  2,236,"You would not be at fault if you divorce women while you have not touched them tamassūhunna also read tumāssūhunna that is while you have not had sexual intercourse with them nor appointed any obligation dowry for them the particle mā ‘while’ relates to the verbal action and is also adverbial that is to say there are no sinful consequences for divorcing them if you have not copulated with them or assigned them a dowry so divorce them; yet make provision of comforts for them honourably that is in accordance with the Law bi’l-ma‘rūf ‘honourably’ is an adjectival qualification of matā‘an ‘comforts’ giving them what they can enjoy the one of ample means the affluent among you according to his means and the needy man of restricted income according to his means — an obligation haqqan ‘obligation’ is either a second qualifier of matā‘an ‘comforts’ or an emphatic verbal noun on the virtuous the obedient ones."
  2,237,"And if you divorce them before you have touched them and you have already appointed for them an obligation then one-half of what you have appointed must be given to them and the other half returns to you; unless it be that they the women make remission and forgo it or he makes remission by leaving her the entire amount the one in whose hand is the knot of marriage the husband to be or as Ibn ‘Abbās is reported to have said ‘The legal guardian where the female is a minor’; in which case nobody would be at fault; yet that you should remit wa-an ta‘fū is the subject is nearer to piety aqrabu li’l-taqwā is its predicate. Forget not kindness between you that is to be bountiful towards one another; surely God sees what you do and will requite you accordingly."
