tafsir[4]{c,v,t}:
  4,34,"Men are in charge of they have authority over women disciplining them and keeping them in check because of that with which God has preferred the one over the other that is because God has given them the advantage over women in knowledge reason authority and otherwise and because of what they expend on them the women of their property. Therefore righteous women among them are obedient to their husbands guarding in the unseen that is guarding their private parts and otherwise during their spouses’ absence because of what God has guarded for them when He enjoined their male spouses to look after them well. And those you fear may be rebellious disobedient to you when such signs appear admonish them make them fear God and share not beds with them retire to other beds if they manifest such disobedience and strike them but not violently if they refuse to desist from their rebellion after leaving them in separate beds. If they then obey you in what is desired from them do not seek a way against them a reason to strike them unjustly. God is ever High Great so beware of Him lest He punish you for treating them unjustly."
  4,35,"And if you fear become aware of a breach a dispute between the two the married couple the genitive construction shiqāqa baynihimā ‘any breach between the two’ is for a range of alternatives in other words shiqāqan baynihimā is the normal construction send forth for them with their consent an arbiter a just man from his folk his kinsmen and an arbiter from her folk the husband delegates to his arbiter the matter of divorce or the acceptance of compensation in its place while she delegates to her arbiter the matter of separation. The two arbiters do their best and bid the one guilty of the injustice to desist or they suggest separation if they see fit. God exalted be He says if they the two arbiters desire to set things right God will grant them the married couple success determining for them what constitutes an act of obedience be it reconciliation or separation. Surely God is ever Knower of everything Aware of what is hidden and what is manifested."
  4,36,"And worship God declare His Oneness and associate nothing with Him. Be kind to parents being dutiful and gentle-mannered and near kindred and to orphans and to the needy and to the neighbour who is near to you in terms of physical vicinity or kinship and to the neighbour who is a stranger the one far from you in terms of physical vicinity or kinship; and to the friend at your side a travelling companion or a colleague at work and it is also said one’s wife; and to the wayfarer the one cut off during a journey and to what your right hands own of bondsmen. Surely God loves not the conceited the arrogant and the boastful the one who boasts before people of what he has been given."
  4,37,"Those alladhīna the subject who are niggardly in their duty and bid other people to be niggardly in the same and conceal what God has bestowed upon them of His bounty in the way of knowledge and property these are the Jews the predicate of the said subject is an implied lahum wa‘īdun shadīd ‘for them there is a promise of severe punishment’. And We have prepared for those that disbelieve in this and other matters a humbling chastisement one of humiliation."
