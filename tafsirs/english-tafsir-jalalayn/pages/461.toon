tafsir[10]{c,v,t}:
  39,22,"Is he whose breast God has opened to Islam and becomes guided so that he follows a light from his Lord …? like he whose heart He has sealed with disbelief? — this understanding of the ellipsis is indicated by what follows. So woe — an expression indicating ‘chastisement’ — to those whose hearts have been hardened against the remembrance of God that is hardened against the acceptance of the Qur’ān. Such are in manifest error."
  39,23,"God has revealed the best of discourses a Book kitāban substitutes for ahsana ‘the best’ namely a Qur’ān consimilar in other words some of its parts are similar to others in terms of their arrangement and otherwise in coupled phrases — a Book in which the Promise of reward is coupled with the Threat of punishment together with other such couplings — whereat quiver at the mention of whose Threat shiver the skins of those who fear their Lord; then their skins and their hearts soften to they are reassured by the remembrance of God that is at the mention of His Promise. That Book is God’s guidance by which He guides whomever He will of His servants; and whomever God leads astray for him there is no guide."
  39,24,"Is he who will be fending off is he who will encounter with his face the awful chastisement on the Day of Resurrection …? that is the most severe chastisement when he is flung into the Fire with his hands bound to his neck in fetters is he like one who will be secure from it by entering Paradise? And it will be said to the wrongdoers namely the disbelievers of Mecca ‘Taste now what you used to earn’ that is taste the requital for it."
  39,25,"Those who were before them denied their messengers with regard to the coming of the chastisement; and so the chastisement came on them whence they were not aware in a way that would never have occurred to them."
  39,26,"So God made them taste disgrace abasement and humiliation in the way of being transformed into swine and being killed and otherwise in the life of this world. And the chastisement of the Hereafter will surely be greater had they that is the deniers known the nature of the chastisement thereof they would not have denied."
  39,27,"And verily We have struck coined for mankind in this Qur’ān every kind of similitude that perhaps they may remember that perhaps they may be admonished —"
  39,28,"an Arabic Qur’ān qur’ānan ‘arabiyyan a circumstantial qualifier for emphasis without any deviation that is without any contradiction or variance that perhaps they may guard themselves against disbelief."
  39,29,"God strikes for the idolater and the believer in God’s Oneness a similitude a man rajulan substitutes for mathalan ‘a similitude’ shared by several masters quarrelling disputing ill-mannered and a man belonging exclusively to one man. Are the two equal in comparison? mathalan for specification in other words the slave of many masters is not the same as the slave of a single person. For in the case of the former if all of his masters were to demand his service simultaneously he would be confused as to whom of them he should serve — which is the similitude of the idolater; the latter the slave of one is the similitude of the one who believes in the One God. Praise be to God! alone. Nay but most of them that is the people of Mecca do not know the chastisement in which they will end up and so they associate others with God."
  39,30,"You — an address to the Prophet s — will indeed die and they too will indeed die and so there is no satisfaction to be gained from another’s death this was revealed because they kept waiting for the Prophet s to die."
  39,31,"Then you will indeed O mankind concerning the injustices you committed towards one another be contending before your Lord on the Day of Resurrection."
