tafsir[7]{c,v,t}:
  2,275,"Those who devour that is those who seize by way of usury which is an excess levied in transactions of money or foodstuffs either on their value or on credit shall not rise again from their graves except rising as one whom Satan has made prostrate demented from touch through madness min al-mass ‘from touch’ is semantically connected to yaqūmūna ‘they rise’; that which befalls them is because of the fact that they say ‘Trade is like usury’ in terms of permissibility this statement is a type of reversed simile used for intensity sc. ‘usury is like trade’ is the expected word order. God responds to them saying that God has permitted trade and forbidden usury. Whoever receives an admonition from his Lord and desists from devouring it he shall have his past gains those made before the prohibition and which cannot be reclaimed from him and his affair with regard to pardoning him is committed to God; but whoever reverts to devouring it treating it like trade in terms of lawfulness — those are the inhabitants of the Fire abiding therein."
  2,276,"God effaces usury diminishing it and eliminating any blessing in it but He augments voluntary almsgivings with interest increasing them making them grow and multiplying their reward. God loves not that is to say He will requite any guilty profligate devouring it ingrate who deems usury licit."
  2,277,"Those who believe and perform righteous deeds and establish the prayer and pay the alms — their wage awaits them with their Lord and no fear shall befall them neither shall they grieve."
  2,278,"O you who believe fear God and give up abandon the usury that is outstanding if you are believers true to your faith since it is expected of the believer that he adhere to God’s command this was revealed when some of the Companions after the prohibition wanted to reclaim some of the usury from before."
  2,279,"But if you do not do what you have been commanded then be warned have knowledge of war from God and His Messenger against you herein is a grave threat for them. When it was revealed they said ‘What power can we have in a war against Him!’ Yet if you repent and forgo it you shall have your principal sums the original amounts not being unjust by charging interest and no injustice being done to you by way of any diminution."
  2,280,"And if any man in debt should be in difficulties then let him have respite a postponement till things are easier read maysara or maysura meaning ‘a time of ease’; but that you should give tassaddaqū where the second tā’ of the softened form tatasaddaqū has been assimilated with the sād the one in difficulty a voluntary almsgiving by waiving his debt is better for you did you but know if you know that it is better for you then do it. In a hadīth it is said ‘Whoever gives respite to one in difficulty or waives his debt God will place him under His shade on a day when there shall be no shade except God’s’ as reported by Muslim."
  2,281,"And fear a day wherein you shall be returned to God namely the Day of Resurrection read the passive turja‘ūna meaning ‘you shall be returned’ or the active tarji‘ūna meaning ‘you shall return’ and every soul on that day shall be paid in full the requital of what it has earned what it has done of good or evil; and they shall not be wronged through any loss of a good deed or the incurring of an extra evil deed."
