  2,1,"Alif lām mīm God knows best what He means by these letters."
  2,2,"That meaning this Book which Muhammad (s) recites in it there is no doubt no uncertainty that it is from God the negation lĀ rayba fĪhi is the predicate of dhĀlika; the use of the demonstrative here is intended to glorify the Book. A guidance hudĀ is a second predicate meaning that it the Book ‘guides’ for the God-fearing namely those that tend towards piety by adhering to commands and avoiding things prohibited thereby guarding themselves from the Fire;"
  2,3,"who believe in that is who accept the truth of the Unseen what is hidden from them of the Resurrection Paradise and the Fire; and maintain the prayer that is to say who perform it giving it its proper due; and of what We have provided them that is of what we have bestowed upon them expend in obedience to God;"
  2,4,"and who believe in what has been revealed to you namely the Qur’ān; and what was revealed before you that is the Torah the Gospel and other scriptures; and of the Hereafter they are certain that is they know it is real."
  2,5,"Those as described in the way mentioned are upon guidance from their Lord those are the ones that will prosper that is who will succeed in entering Paradise and be saved from the Fire."
