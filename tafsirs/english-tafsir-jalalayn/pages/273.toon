tafsir[10]{c,v,t}:
  16,55,"in order to deny that grace which We have given them. So enjoy that consent of yours to worship idols an imperative meant as a threat for soon you shall know the consequence of this."
  16,56,"And they that is the idolaters assign to what they do not know that they cause harm and cannot benefit them — namely the idols — a portion of that which We have provided them with of crops and cattle saying that ‘this is for God and this is for our partners’. By God you will indeed be questioned a questioning of rebuke; there is a shift herein from the third to the second person about what you used to fabricate against God such as claiming that He commanded you to do this."
  16,57,"And they assign to God daughters by claiming that the angels are the daughters of God — Be He glorified! — a declaration that He is exalted above that which they claim — while they will have what they desire namely sons the status of this sentence is either independent nominative or that of an accusative object of the verb yaj‘alūna ‘they assign’. The meaning is that to Him they assign daughters to whom they are averse when in any case He is exalted beyond having offspring while to themselves they assign sons of their own choosing so that the best is theirs exclusively — like where God says Now ask them are daughters to be for your Lord while sons are to be for them? Q. 37149."
  16,58,"And when one of them is given the tidings of a girl that will be born to him his face becomes darkened transformed like that of one suddenly struck by grief and he chokes inwardly filled with anguish so how is it that daughters are attributed to Him exalted be He?"
  16,59,"He hides disappearing from people that is from his people out of distress at the tidings given to him fearing mockery unsure what to do with it the newborn shall he retain it — refrain from killing it — in humiliation enduring shame and disgrace or trample into the dust by burying it alive. Verily wretched is what they judge evil is this judgement of theirs in which they ascribe to their Creator that His are the daughters who have such a lowly status in their eyes."
  16,60,"For those who do not believe in the Hereafter namely for the disbelievers there is an evil description in other words theirs is the most evil attribute meaning the most vile which is their burying alive of newborn girls despite the fact that they are needed for the purposes of marriage; and the loftiest description belongs to God His is the attribute most sublime namely that there is no god except Him. And He is the Mighty in His kingdom the Wise in His creation."
  16,61,"And if God were to take mankind to task for their wrongdoing wrongdoing through acts of disobedience He would not leave upon it that is upon the earth any living being any single living thing moving upon it; but He gives them respite until an appointed term; and when their term comes they will not defer from it by a single hour nor advance it."
  16,62,"Still they assign to God what they dislike for themselves — such as daughters partners in power and the mistreatment of messengers. And their tongues despite this relate tell the lie which is that theirs will be the best reward with God namely Paradise as He God states in their words elsewhere ‘And in case I am returned to my Lord I will indeed have the best reward with Him’ Q. 4150. But God exalted be He says Without any doubt — verily — theirs shall be the Fire and they shall be abandoned therein or it mufratūn means that they shall be foremost in entering it a variant reading for mufratūn has mufritūn meaning that ‘they transgress the bounds’."
  16,63,"By God We verily sent to communities before you messengers. But Satan adorned for them their deeds their evil deeds so that they considered them to be good deeds and therefore they denied the messengers. So he is their patron the guardian of their affairs today that is now in this world and for them there will be a painful chastisement in the Hereafter. It is also said that by al-yawm ‘today’ is meant the Day of Resurrection narrating the events as though they are taking place now. In other words they have no guardian other than him in other words Satan and as he is incapable of helping himself how could he possibly help them?"
  16,64,"And We have not revealed to you O Muhammad (s) the Book the Qur’ān except for the purpose that you may make clear to them to mankind that wherein they differ in the matter of religion and as a guidance wa-hudan is a supplement to wa-li-tubayyina ‘and that you may make clear’ and as a mercy for a people who believe in it."
