tafsir[6]{c,v,t}:
  48,10,"Truly those who pledge allegiance to you the ‘Pledge of Beatitude’ bay‘at al-ridwān given at al-Hudaybiyya in fact pledge allegiance to God — this statement is akin to Whoever obeys the Messenger verily obeys God Q. 480. The Hand of God is above their hands the hands with which they pledged allegiance to the Prophet in other words God exalted be He has observed their pledge of allegiance and will requite them in accordance with their adherence to it. So whoever reneges whoever breaches the pledge reneges — that is the evil consequences of his breach will eventually be — against his own soul; and whoever fulfils the covenant which he has made with God He will give him fa-sa-yu’tīhi; or read fa-sa-nu’tīhi ‘We will give him’ a great reward."
  48,11,"Those of the Bedouins who were left behind around Medina — that is to say those whom God made to stay behind and not to accompany you when you had asked them to set out with you for Mecca fearing that Quraysh would attack you upon your return in the year of al-Hudaybiyya — will say to you ‘Our possessions and our families kept us occupied preventing us from going forth with you. So ask forgiveness for us!’ of God for our failure to go forth with you. God exalted be He exposes their mendacity by saying They say with their tongues that is to say in asking forgiveness and in the preceding statement of theirs what is not in their hearts and so they are lying in the excuse which they give. Say ‘Who can an interrogative meant rhetorically as a negation that is to say ‘none can’ avail you anything against God should He desire to cause you harm read darran or durran or desire to bring you benefit? Nay but God is ever Aware of what you do in other words He is ever possessed of such an attribute."
  48,12,"Nay bal in both instances marks a transition from one subject to another but you thought that the Messenger and the believers would never return to their families and that thought was adorned in your hearts that is to say you thought that they would be annihilated by being slain and would not return and you thought evil thoughts that just mentioned and other things and you were a ruined lot’ būr is the plural of bā’ir in other words a lot to be destroyed according to God for having entertained such evil thoughts."
  48,13,"And whoever does not believe in God and His Messenger We have prepared for the disbelievers a blaze a severe fire."
  48,14,"And to God belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth He forgives whomever He will and chastises whomever He will; and God is ever Forgiving Merciful that is to say He is ever possessed of the attributes mentioned."
  48,15,"Those mentioned who were left behind will say when you set forth after spoils namely the spoils of Khaybar in order to capture them ‘Let us follow you’ that we might also take a share of it. They desire thereby to change the words of God kalāma’Llāhi a variant reading has kalima’Llāhi in other words His promising of the spoils of Khaybar exclusively for those who were at al-Hudaybiyya. Say ‘You shall never follow us! Thus has God said beforehand’ that is prior to our return. Then they will say ‘Nay but you are envious of us’ lest we might acquire a share of the spoils and therefore you say this that you say. Nay but they never understood anything of religion all except a few of them."
