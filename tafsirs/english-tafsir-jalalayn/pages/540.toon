  57,19,"And those who believe in God and His messengers — they are the truthful al-siddīqūna those who go to the greatest lengths to be truthful and the witnesses with their Lord against the deniers of all communities; they will have their reward and their light. But those who disbelieve and deny Our signs those signs that testify to the truth of Our Oneness — they will be the inhabitants of Hell-fire."
  57,20,"Know that the life of this world is merely play and diversion and glitter the frequent adornment of oneself and mutual vainglory in respect of wealth and children that is preoccupation with such things — but as for acts of obedience and incentives thereto these are the concerns of the Hereafter; as the likeness of that is to say it in the manner in which you admire it and in the manner in which it will disappear is as the likeness of rain whose vegetation which results from this rain the disbelievers the sowers admire; but then it withers it becomes dried-up and you see it turn yellow then it becomes chaff scatters vanishing with the winds. And in the Hereafter there is a severe chastisement for those who prefer this world to it and forgiveness from God and beatitude for those who have not preferred this world to it; and the life of this world that is to say the comfort enjoyed in it is but the comfort of delusion."
  57,21,"Vie with one another for forgiveness from your Lord and a garden the breadth of which is as the breadth of the heaven and the earth if one were placed at the end of the other prepared for those who believe in God and His messengers.

  57,22,"No affliction befalls in the earth by way of drought for example or in yourselves such as illness or the loss of a child but it is in a Book meaning the Preserved Tablet al-lawh al-mahfūz before We bring it about before We create it — the same is said to be true of God’s graces — that is indeed easy for God"
  57,23,"so that you may not kay-lā kay makes a verb subjunctive with the same sense as an as in an-lā ‘so that … not’ that is to say God informs you of this so that you may not grieve for what escapes you nor exult with a wanton exultation rather an exultation that is followed by a thanksgiving for the grace at what He has given you read thus as ātākum; or read as atākum meaning ‘at what has come to you from Him’. For God does not like any swaggering braggart swaggering in arrogance because of what he has been given boastful of it to people;"
  57,24,"such as are niggardly in their duties and bid people to be niggardly in these too against such there is a severe threat of chastisement. And whoever turns away from what is his duty still God He is indeed huwa ‘He’ is a separating pronoun; a variant reading drops it the Independent without need of anyone other than Him the Praiser of His friends."
