tafsir[6]{c,v,t}:
  16,88,"Those who disbelieve and bar people from the way of God from His religion them We shall add chastisement to their chastisement that chastisement which they have merited for their disbelief — Ibn Mas‘ūd said ‘Their chastisment will consist of scorpions whose fangs are as long as the tallest palm trees’ — because of the corruption they used to cause by their barring people from belief."
  16,89,"And mention the day We shall raise up from every community a witness against them from among themselves and this will be their that community’s prophet and We shall bring you O Muhammad (s) as a witness against these namely your people. And We have revealed to you the Book the Qur’ān as a clarification of all things that people might need concerning the Law and as a guidance from error and a mercy and good tidings of Paradise to those who submit those who affirm the Oneness of God."
  16,90,"Indeed God enjoins justice — that is affirmation of His Oneness or actually being fair and virtue performance of the religious obligations or that you should worship God as if you were able to see Him as reported in the hadīth; and giving to kinsfolk — He has singled it kinship out for mention by way of highlighting its importance — and He forbids lewdness fornication and abomination with regard to the stipulations of the Law abomination such as disbelief and acts of disobedience and aggression wrongdoing against people — He also singles this out for mention by way of showing its importance; just as He began with the mention of ‘lewdness’ in this way He admonishes you through commands and prohibitions so that you might remember that you might be admonished tadhakkarūna ‘you might remember’ the original tā’ of tatadhakkarūna has been assimilated with the dhāl. In the Mustadrak of al-Hākim al-Naysābūrī it is reported from Ibn Mas‘ūd that he said ‘This verse is the most comprehensive verse in the Qur’ān in terms of what is good and what is evil’."
  16,91,"And fulfil God’s covenant effected by way of pledges of allegiance and oaths and in other ways when you made a covenant and do not break your oaths after pledging them and having made God surety over you that you will fulfill the covenant for you have sworn the oath by Him the sentence wa-qad ja‘altumu’Llāha ‘alaykum kafīlan ‘and having made God surety over you’ is a circumstantial qualifier. Truly God knows what you do — this is a threat for them."
  16,92,"And do not be like her who undoes spoils her yarn that which she has spun after having made it strong having set and spun it breaking it up into fibres ankāthan is a circumstantial qualifier ankāth is the plural of nikth and means that which is undone yunkathu — this was an imbecile Meccan woman who used to spin all day and then undo it — by making tattakhidhūna is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the person of the verb takūnū ‘do not be like’ in other words what is meant is ‘do not be like her by making’ your oaths a means of deceit dakhal is what enters yadkhulu into something but does not belong to it in other words as a means of causing mischief or as trickery between you by breaking these oaths so that one group may become more numerous than another group. They used to enter into an alliance with a given group but if they encountered another more numerous and more powerful group they would renege on their alliance with the former and forge a new alliance with these latter. God only tries tests you thereby in other words by that which He enjoins in the way of fulfilling the covenant so that He may observe the obedient and the disobedient among you or when it is the case that one group is more numerous than another that He may observe whether you fulfil your obligation to them or not; and certainly He will make clear to you on the Day of Resurrection that wherein you used to differ during the life of this world with regard to covenants and otherwise by punishing he who reneged and rewarding he who was faithful to his covenant."
  16,93,"For if God had willed He could have made you one community people of a single religion but He leads astray whom He will and guides whom He will and you will surely be questioned on the Day of Resurrection a questioning of rebuke about what you used to do so that you might be requited for it."
