tafsir[5]{c,v,t}:
  4,7,"The following was revealed as a repudiation of pre-Islamic practices in which women and children were not given any inheritance To the men young ones and kin belongs a share a portion of what deceased parents and kinsmen leave and to the women belongs a share of what parents and kinsmen leave whether it the property be little or much. God has made it an obligatory share apportioned to be given to them."
  4,8,"And when the division of the inheritance is attended by kinsmen those of kinship who cannot inherit and orphans and the poor grant them something out of it before the division is effected; and if the inheritors are young speak to them O guardians honourable words kindly by apologising to them that it is not your possession to divide as you wish but that it is for the young inheritors. Some say that this stipulation was abrogated; others say that it was not only that people were all too readily neglecting it since it was encouraged but not prescribed. According to Ibn ‘Abbās however it is a duty."
  4,9,"And let them fear let them be concerned for the orphans those who if they are about to leave behind them that is after their death weak offspring young children would be afraid for them; that they be ruined; let them fear God in the matter concerning orphans and let them give what they would love for their own offspring after their death; and speak to the one approached by death pertinent words the right words by enjoining him to give as voluntary almsgiving no more than the third of the inheritance and leave the remainder for the ones inheriting so that they do not end up as dependants."
  4,10,"Those who consume the property of orphans unjustly without any right are only consuming the whole of it as fire in their bellies because that is where such action leads and they shall be exposed to read active yaslawna or passive yuslawna that is they shall enter a blaze an intense fire in which they shall burn."
  4,11,"God charges you He commands you concerning the matter of your children with what He will mention to the male of them the equivalent of the portion the lot of two females if there are two women with him so that half the property is his and the other half is theirs; if there is only one female with him then she has a third and he receives two thirds; if he is the only one he takes it all; and if they the offspring be only women more than two then for them two-thirds of what he the deceased leaves; likewise if they be two women since in the case of two sisters more deserving of such a share God says They shall receive two-thirds of what he leaves Q. 4176; and since a female is entitled to a third with a male she is all the more deserving of the same share with a female. It is said that fawq ‘more than’ introduces a relative clause; it is also said to guard against the wrong impression that the greater the number of females the greater the portion they are entitled to since it is mistakenly thought that the entitlement of two females to two-thirds derives from the fact that a female is entitled to one third when with a male; but if she the daughter be one wāhidatan is also read wāhidatun making the kāna construction syntactically complete then to her a half; and to his parents the deceased’s to each one of the two li-kulli wāhidin minhumā substitutes for the previous li-abawayhi ‘to his parents’ the sixth of what he leaves if he has a child male or female the point of the substitution is to show that they do not share the sixth but receive one each. The term ‘child’ walad also applies to a grandchild and likewise ‘parent’ abb to a grandparent; but if he has no child and his heirs are his parents alone or along with a spouse then to his mother read li-ummihi; also read in both places here and further down li-immihi in order to avoid the cumbersome transition from a damma ‘u’ to a kasra ‘I’ a third of the property or what remains after the spouse the rest being for the father; or if he has siblings two or more males or females to his mother a sixth and the rest for the father and nothing for the siblings."
