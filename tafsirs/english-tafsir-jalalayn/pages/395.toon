  28,78,"He said ‘In fact I have been given it that is this wealth because of knowledge I possess’ in other words in return for it — he was the most knowledgeable of the Children of Israel in the Torah after Moses and Aaron. God exalted be He says Does he not know that God had already destroyed before him generations communities of men stronger than him in might and greater in the amassing? of wealth; in other words he does know this. And God destroys them and the guilty will not be questioned about their sins because of God’s knowledge of these sins and so they will be admitted into the Fire without a reckoning."
  28,79,"So he Korah emerged before his people in his finery with his large retinue all of them in procession dressed in gold and silk garments and mounted on adorned horses and mules. Those who desired the life of this world said ‘O yā is for drawing attention would that we had the like of what Korah has been given this world. Truly he enjoys great fortune’ abundant fortune in it."
  28,80,"But those to whom knowledge had been given knowledge of what God had promised in the Hereafter said to them ‘Woe to you! waylakum is an expression of reprimand God’s reward of Paradise in the Hereafter is better for him who believes and acts righteously than what Korah has been given in this world; and none will obtain it namely the Paradise that is given as a reward except those who are steadfast’ in their adherence to obedience and refrain from disobedience."
  28,81,"So We caused the earth to swallow him Korah and his dwelling and he had no host to help him besides God that is other than Him to protect him from destruction nor was he of those who can rescue themselves from it."

Lo! indeed those who are ungrateful for God’s grace such as Korah never prosper."
  28,83,"That is the Abode of the Hereafter namely Paradise which We shall grant to those who do not desire to be haughty in the earth through insolence nor to cause corruption by committing acts of disobedience. And the praiseworthy sequel will be for those who fear God’s punishment by performing deeds of obedience."
  28,84,"Whoever brings a good deed shall have better than it as a reward because of it and this will be the like of it tenfold; while whoever brings an evil deed those who commit evil deeds shall only be requited the requital for what they used to do in other words only the like of it."
