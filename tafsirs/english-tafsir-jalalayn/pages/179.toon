tafsir[9]{c,v,t}:
  8,17,"You did not slay them at Badr by your own might but God slew them by giving you assistance and you threw not O Muhammad (s) against the eyes of the unbelieving folk when you threw the pebbles for a handful of pebbles thrown by a human being cannot strike the eyes of every person in a large troop but God threw by making that throw reach them. He did this in order to vanquish the disbelievers and that He might try the believers with a fair test a fair gift namely booty; surely God is Hearing of their sayings Knowing of their conditions."
  8,18,"That is the true gift for you and know that God weakens the plan of the disbelievers."
  8,19,"If you have sought a judgement O disbelievers if you have sought a decisive conclusion of this battle — Abū Jahl had said ‘O God! Whoever among the two of us is the one who has severed the ties of kinship and brought us what we had never known destroy them today!’ — the judgement the decisive conclusion has now come to you by the fact that the one so described has already perished this was Abū Jahl and those killed with him and not the Prophet s and the believers; and if you desist from unbelief and waging war it will better for you. But if you return to fight against the Prophet s We shall return to assist him against you and your host your troops will not avail will not protect you in any way however numerous it be; and verily God is with the believers read thus inna indicating a new sentence; or read anna with an implicit lām li-anna‘Llāha ma‘a’l-mu’minīn ‘because God is with the believers’."
  8,20,"O you who believe obey God and His Messenger and do not turn away from Him by contravening His command while you are listening to the Qur’ān and the admonitions."
  8,21,"And do not be as those who say ‘We hear’ and they hear not in such a way as to reflect and heed admonition — these are either the hypocrites or the idolaters."
  8,22,"Surely the worst of beasts in God’s sight are those who are deaf to hearing the truth and dumb unable to utter it those who do not understand."
  8,23,"For had God known of any good in them any righteousness were they to listen to the truth He would have made them hear in such a way as to understand; and had He made them hear — hypothetically speaking — already knowing that there is no good in them they would have turned away from it averse to accepting it out of obstinacy and in denial."
  8,24,"O you who believe respond to God and the Messenger with obedience when He calls you to that which will give you life in the matter of religion for it will be the source of everlasting life for you; and know that God comes in between a man and his heart so that he cannot believe or disbelieve except by His will; and that it is to Him that you shall be gathered and He will requite you for your deeds."
  8,25,"And be afraid of a trial which if it were to fall upon you would certainly not fall exclusively upon the evildoers among you but would encompass them and others and the way to guard against it is to repudiate that evil which necessarily results in precipitating it; and know that God is severe in retribution against those who oppose Him."
