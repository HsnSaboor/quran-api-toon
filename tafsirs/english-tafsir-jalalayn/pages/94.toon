tafsir[7]{c,v,t}:
  4,95,"The believers who sit at home away from the struggle other than those who have an injury such as a chronic illness or blindness or the like read in the nominative ghayru ūlī l-darar ‘other than those who have an injury’ as an adjectival clause; or in the accusative ghayra ūlī l-darar as an exceptive clause are not the equals of those who struggle in the way of God with their possessions and their lives. God has preferred those who struggle with their possessions and their lives over the ones who sit at home on account of some injury by a degree by a degree of merit since both have the same intention but the extra degree is given to those who have carried out the struggle; yet to each of the two groups God has promised the goodly reward Paradise and God has preferred those who struggle over the ones who sit at home without any injury with a great reward ajran ‘azīman is substituted by the following darajātin minhu"
  4,96,"degrees that is stations one higher than the other in honour from Him and forgiveness and mercy maghfiratan and rahmatan are in the accusative because they constitute an object of the implied verb faddala ‘He has preferred’. Surely God is ever Forgiving to His friends Merciful to those that obey Him."
  4,97,"The following was revealed regarding a group of people who submitted to Islam but did not emigrate and were then slain in the battle of Badr alongside the disbelievers And those whom the angels take in death while they are wronging their souls having remained among the disbelievers and neglected to emigrate the angels will say to them in rebuke ‘What was your predicament?’ in other words ‘in what circumstances were you with regard to your religion’. They will say giving excuses ‘We were oppressed unable to establish religion in the land’ the land of Mecca. The angels will say to them in rebuke ‘But was not God’s earth spacious that you might have emigrated therein?’ from the land of unbelief to another land as others did? God exalted be He says as for such their abode shall be Hell — an evil journey’s end it is!"
  4,98,"Except the oppressed among the men women and children who are unable to devise a plan having no strength to emigrate and no substance and are not guided to a way a means of going to the land of emigration."
  4,99,"As for such perhaps God will pardon them for God is ever Pardoning Forgiving."
  4,100,"Whoever emigrates in the way of God will find in the earth many refuges places of emigration and abundance of provision; whoever goes forth from his house as an emigrant to God and His Messenger and then death overtakes him along the way as occurred with Junda‘ or Jundab b. Damra al-Laythī his wage is then incumbent upon fixed with God; surely God is ever Forgiving Merciful."
  4,101,"And when you are going forth travelling in the land you would not be at fault if you shorten the prayer by making it two genuflexions instead of four if you fear that you may be afflicted by those who do not believe that is if you fear that you may be harmed by them this fear of affliction at the hands of the disbelievers is just intended as an explication of the reality of the situation at that time and the point no longer applies. In the Sunna it is pointed out that ‘travel’ safar means long-distance travel which is approximately 50 miles. God’s words ‘you would not be at fault’ should be understood as denoting a dispensation and not a requirement and this is the opinion of al-Shāfi‘ī; the disbelievers are a manifest foe to you their enmity being evident."
