  45,33,"And there will appear before them in the Hereafter the evils of what they did in this world that is to say the requital thereof and they will be besieged by there shall befall them what they used to deride namely the chastisement of the Hereafter."
  45,34,"And it will be said ‘Today We will forget you We will abandon you in the Fire just as you forgot the encounter of this day of yours that is to say just as you neglected to perform those good deeds in preparation for the encounter with it and your abode will be the Fire and you will not have any helpers any protectors therefrom."
  45,35,"That is because you took God’s signs the Qur’ān in mockery and the life of this world deceived you’ to the extent that you said ‘There is neither Resurrection nor Reckoning’. So today they will not be brought out read either active yakhrujūna ‘they will not come out’ or passive yukhrajūna ‘they will not be brought out’ of it of the Fire nor will they asked to make amends they will not be asked to try to attain the pleasure of their Lord by repenting or being obedient for such action will be of no use then."
  45,36,"So to God belongs all praise the attribution to Him of what is beautiful in words for fulfilling His promise regarding the deniers; Lord of the heavens and Lord of the earth the Lord of the Worlds the Creator of all that has been mentioned ‘ālam ‘world’ denotes everything other than God; it is in the plural ‘ālamīn because of the different types of beings in them; rabbi ‘Lord’ in the last clause is a substitution for the previous ones."
  45,37,"And to Him belongs all grandeur all majesty in the heavens and the earth fī’l-samāwāti wa’l-ardi is a circumstantial qualifier and He is the Mighty the Wise — as explained in a similar statement above."
  46,1,"Hā mīm God knows best what He means by these letters."
  46,2,"The revelation of the Book the Qur’ān tanzīlu’l-kitābi the subject is from God mina’Llāhi the predicate thereof the Mighty in His kingdom the Wise in His actions."
  46,3,"We have not created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them except as a creation in truth so that it may be an indication of Our power and Our Oneness and for an appointed term until the point of their annihilation on the Day of Resurrection. Yet those who disbelieve are disregardful of what they are warned of what they are threatened with in the way of impending chastisement."
  46,4,"Say ‘Have you considered say Inform me about what you invoke what you worship besides God? namely the idols min dūni’Llāhi constitutes the first object of the verb. Show me — inform me — arūnī repeated for emphasis what they have created mādhā khalaqū the second object of the earth mina’l-ardi the explication of mā ‘what part’. Or do they have any share any partnership in the creation of the heavens? with God? am ‘or’ has the significance of the rhetorical interrogative hamza of denial. Bring me a scripture that has been revealed before this Qur’ān or some vestige some remnant of knowledge transmitted from the ancients confirming the soundness of your claim that your worship of the idols brings you closer to God if you are truthful’ in your claim."
  46,5,"And who is man here is interrogative but meant rhetorically as a negation in other words ‘no one is’ further astray than him who invokes him who worships besides God that is to say other than Him such as would not respond to him even until the Day of Resurrection — these are the idols who never answer those who worship them in anything that they ask for — and who are heedless of their supplication? their worship because they are inanimates that possess no faculty of comprehension."
