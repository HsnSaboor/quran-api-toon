tafsir[8]{c,v,t}:
  3,133,"And vie with one another hastening read wa-sāri‘ū or simply sāri‘ū to forgiveness from your Lord and to a garden as wide as the heavens and the earth that is as broad as both of them together if put side by side breadth denotes ampleness that has been prepared for those who fear God in being obedient and abandoning acts of disobedience."
  3,134,"Who expend in obedience to God in prosperity and adversity in times of ease and difficulty and restrain their rage and desist from following it up even though they are able to and pardon their fellow-men those who wrong them waiving their punishment; and God loves those who are virtuous through such actions that is to say He will reward them."
  3,135,"And who when they commit an indecency a despicable sin such as adultery or wrong themselves with less than that such as a kiss remember God that is to say His threat of punishment and pray forgiveness for their sins — and who that is none shall forgive sins but God? — and who do not persist persevere in what they did but have desisted from it knowing that what they did was sinful."
  3,136,"Those — their requital is forgiveness from their Lord and Gardens beneath which rivers flow abiding therein khālidīna fīhā an implied situation that is it is foreordained that they will abide in it once they enter it; excellent is the wage this wage of those workers of obedience!"
  3,137,"The following was revealed regarding the defeat at Uhud Ways of life have passed away before you all manner of unbelief has preceded where they have been given respite but are then seized with punishment; so travel in the land O believers and behold how was the end of those who denied the messengers that is how their affair ended in destruction. So do not grieve on account of their victory I am only giving them respite until their appointed time."
  3,138,"This Qur’ān is an exposition for all mankind and a guidance from error and an admonition for such as are God-fearing among them."
  3,139,"Faint not shrink not from fighting the disbelievers neither grieve for what befell you at Uhud for you shall prevail through victory over them if you are truly believers. the response to this last conditional clause is the sum meaning of what has preceded it."
  3,140,"If a wound touches you befalls you at Uhud a like wound qarh or qurh which is the exhaustion that results from a wound and the like already at Badr has touched the other people the disbelievers. Such days We deal out in turn We dispense them among mankind one day for one group the next day for another that they might be admonished and that God may know through knowledge manifested outwardly those who believe who are sincere in their faith from others; and that He may take witnesses from among you honouring them with martyrdom and God loves not the evildoers the disbelievers that is He will chastise them and the blessings He bestows upon them are only a means of drawing out their punishment."
