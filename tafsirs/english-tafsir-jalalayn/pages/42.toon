  2,253,"Those tilka is the subject messengers al-rusul is either an adjective or the predicate some We have preferred above others by assigning a particular trait to one not found in the other; some there are to whom God spoke such as Moses and some He raised in rank namely Muhammad (s) on account of his call being to all peoples his being the Seal of the Prophets on account of the superiority of his community to all others the sundry miracles and the many special qualities. And We gave Jesus son of Mary the clear proofs and confirmed him strengthened him with the Holy Spirit namely Gabriel who would accompany him wherever he went. And had God willed that all people be guided those who came after them after the messengers that is their communities would not have fought against one another after the clear proofs had come to them because of their disagreement and their leading one another astray; but they fell into variance as He willed and some of them believed and adhered firmly to his faith and some disbelieved as the Christians did after Jesus al-Masīh and had God willed they would not have fought against one another repeated here for emphasis but God does whatever He desires giving success to whomever He will and disappointment to whomever He will."
  2,254,"O you who believe expend of what We have provided you with what is due of it as alms before there comes a day in which there shall be neither commerce ransom nor friendship that can be of any benefit nor intercession without His permission a variant reading has all three nouns in nominative inflection bay‘un khullatun shafā‘atun as opposed to lā bay‘a lā khullata lā shafā‘ata this is the Day of Resurrection. And the disbelievers those that disbelieve in God or in the obligations He has imposed on them — they are the evildoers for not respecting God’s command."
  2,255,"God there is no god that is there is none worthy of being worshipped in all existence except Him the Living the Everlasting the Eternal Sustainer the One constantly engaged in the management of His creation. Slumber does not seize Him neither sleep; to Him belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth as possessions creatures and servants; who is there that is to say none is there that shall intercede with Him save by His leave? in this for him. He knows what lies before them that is creation and what is after them of the affairs of this world and the Hereafter; and they encompass nothing of His knowledge that is they know nothing of what He knows save such as He wills to inform of it by way of His messengers. His throne subsumes the heavens and the earth it is said that His knowledge encompasses them both; it is also said that the kursī ‘throne’ itself subsumes them on account of its vastness as in the hadīth ‘The seven heavens compared to the kursī are like seven silver coins lying in a metal shield of armour’; the preserving of them the heavens and the earth wearies Him not does not burden Him; He is the Sublime above His creation by virtue of His subjugation of them the Tremendous the Great."
  2,256,"There is no compulsion in entering into religion. Rectitude has become clear from error that is say through clear proofs it has become manifest that faith is rectitude and disbelief is error this was revealed concerning the Ansār of Medina who tried to compel their sons to enter into Islam; so whoever disbelieves in the false deity namely Satan or idols tāghūt ‘false deity’ is used in a singular and plural sense and believes in God has laid hold of the most firm handle the tight knot unbreaking that cannot be severed; God is Hearing of what is said Knowing of what is done."
