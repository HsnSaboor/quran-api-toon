tafsir[5]{c,v,t}:
  48,24,"And it is He Who withheld their hands from you and your hands from them in the valley of Mecca at al-Hudaybiyya after He had made you victors over them for eighty of them surrounded your camp in order to inflict losses upon you but they were captured and taken to the Prophet s who pardoned them and set them free and this resulted in the truce. And God is ever Seer of what you do read ta‘malūna or ya‘malūna ‘they do’ that is to say He is ever possessed of this attribute."
  48,25,"They are the ones who disbelieved and barred you from the Sacred Mosque that is barred you from reaching it and prevented the offering wa’l-hadya is a supplement to the suffixed pronoun –kum ‘you’ of saddūkum ‘they barred you’ which was detained ma‘kūfan is a circumstantial qualifier from reaching its destination that is from the place at which it is customarily sacrificed namely the Sanctuary itself an yablugha mahillahu is an inclusive substitution. And were it not for some of the believing men and believing women being present at Mecca alongside the disbelievers whom you did not know to be believers — lest you should trample them that is to say lest you should slay them together with the disbelievers had you been given permission to embark on the conquest an tata’ūhum is an inclusive substitution for –hum ‘them’ of lam ta‘lamūhum ‘whom you did not know’ and thus incur sin on account of them without your knowing it … the third person pronouns in both groups of people predominantly imply males; the response to lawlā ‘were it not’ has been omitted through ellipsis being something along the lines of la-udhina lakum fī’l-fathi ‘you would have been permitted to embark on the conquest’ but permission for this was not given at the time so that God may admit into His mercy whom He will such as those believers mentioned. Had they been clearly separated had they the believers been distinguishable from the disbelievers We would have surely chastised the disbelievers among them of the people of Mecca immediately thereat by permitting you to go ahead with the conquest thereof with a painful chastisement."
  48,26,"When those who disbelieve alladhīna kafarū is the subject of the following verb ja‘ala nourished idh ja‘ala is semantically connected to ‘adhdhabnā in their hearts zealotry al-hamiyya means ‘disdain of something’ the zealotry of pagandom hamiyyata’l-jāhiliyyati substitutes for al-hamiyyata ‘zealotry’ namely their barring of the Prophet and his Companions from visiting the Sacred Mosque but then God sent down His spirit of Peace upon His Messenger and the believers and so they the disbelievers made a truce with them on the condition that they the believers would be allowed to return the following year and such zealotry would not overcome them the believers as it did the disbelievers then until they would come to fight them later and He made them the believers abide by the word of God-fearing kalimata’l-taqwā ‘there is no god except God and Muhammad is His Messenger’ it kalima ‘word’ is annexed to al-taqwā because it is the cause of it for they were worthier of it of the word than the disbelievers and deserving of it wa-ahlahā is an explanatory supplement. And God is ever Knower of all things that is to say He is ever possessed of such an attribute and among the things He knows is that they are worthy of it."
  48,27,"Verily God has fulfilled the vision for His Messenger in all truth The Messenger of God s saw in his sleep in the year of al-Hudaybiyya before his departure from Medina that he would enter Mecca together with his Companions safely whereafter they would shave completely or shorten their hair. He informed his Companions of this and they rejoiced. But when they set off with him from Medina and the disbelievers impeded them at al-Hudaybiyya such that they had to retreat which was distressing for them for some of the hypocrites began to have doubts about the Prophet’s sincerity this verse was revealed bi’l-haqqi ‘in all truth’ is semantically connected to sadaqa ‘fulfilled’ or it is a circumstantial qualifier referring to al-ru’yā ‘the vision’ and what comes after it is the explanation thereof ‘You will assuredly enter the Sacred Mosque God willing — this is said to secure blessings — in safety to shave your heads that is all the hair or to shorten it to shorten some of the hair both muhalliqīna and muqassirīna are implied circumstantial qualifiers without any fear’ ever. So He knew there to be in the truce what you did not know in the way of reconciliation between the believers and the Meccans and assigned you before that entry a near victory namely the conquest of Khaybar — the vision was fulfilled in the following year."
  48,28,"It is He Who has sent His Messenger with guidance and the religion of truth that He may make it that is the religion of truth prevail over all religion over all the other religions. And God suffices as witness to the fact that you have been sent with what has been mentioned as God exalted be He says"
