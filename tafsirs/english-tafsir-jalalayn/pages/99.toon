tafsir[7]{c,v,t}:
  4,128,"And if a woman wa-in imra’atun is in the nominative because of it being the subject of the explicative verb that follows fears anticipates from her husband ill-treatment if he looks down on her by refraining to sleep with her or by not maintaining her adequately because he is averse to her and aspires to one more beautiful than her or rejection turning his face away from her they are not at fault if they are reconciled through some agreement in terms of shares and maintenance expenses so that she concedes something to him in return for continuing companionship; if she agrees to this then that is fine but if she does not then the husband must either give her all her due or part with her an yassālahā ‘they reconcile’ the original tā’ of yatasālahā has been assimilated with the sād; a variant reading has an yuslihā from the fourth form aslaha; reconciliation is better than separation ill-treatment or rejection. God exalted be He in explaining the natural disposition of man says But greed has been made present in the souls al-shuhh is extreme niggardliness meaning that they have a natural propensity for this as if they the souls are ever in its presence never absent from it. The meaning is a woman would scarcely allow another to share her husband with her and a man would scarcely allow her to enjoy him if he were to fall in love with another. If you are virtuous in your conjugal life with women and fear being unjust to them surely God is ever aware of what you do and He will requite you for it."
  4,129,"You will never be able to be just to to treat equally your wives in terms of love even if you be eager for this; yet do not turn altogether away towards the one you love with respect to the shares and maintenance expenses so that you leave her the one from whom you turn away like one suspended one that is neither a slavegirl nor a woman with a husband. If you set things right by being just with the shares and fear injustice surely God is ever Forgiving regarding the inclination in your hearts Merciful to you in this respect."
  4,130,"But if they the married couple separate by way of divorce God will compensate each of them from the need of the other out of His plenty that is out of His bounty by giving her another as husband and giving him another as wife. God is ever Embracing of His creatures in bounty Wise in what He has ordained for them."
  4,131,"To God belongs all that is in the heavens and in the earth. We have charged those who were given the Scripture meaning the scriptures before you namely the Jews and Christians and you O people of the Qur’ān ‘Fear God’ fear His punishment by being obedient to Him. And We said to them and to you ‘If you disbelieve in what you have been charged with then to God belongs all that is in the heavens and in the earth’ as creatures possessions and servants and He will not be harmed by your disbelief God is ever Independent of the need for His creation or their worship Praised praise-worthy for what He does with them."
  4,132,"To God belongs all that is in the heavens and in the earth He has repeated this in order to reaffirm the reason why fear of God is necessary; God suffices as a Guardian witnessing the fact that what is contained in them belongs to Him."
  4,133,"If He will He can remove you O people and bring others instead of you surely God is ever able to do that."
  4,134,"Whoever desires by his deeds the reward of this world then God has the reward of this world and of the Hereafter for the one who wants it and no one else has it so why do any of you demand the lower reward? Why do you not seek the higher one by devoting yourself sincerely to Him since what reward he seeks can only be found with Him; God is ever Hearer Seer."
