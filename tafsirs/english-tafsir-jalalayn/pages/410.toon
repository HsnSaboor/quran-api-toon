tafsir[10]{c,v,t}:
  30,51,"But if wa-la-in the lām is for oaths We unleash a different wind that damages vegetation and they see it turn yellow they would begin la-zallū is the response to the conditional oath after that that is after its turning yellow to disbelieve to deny the grace of having been given rain."
  30,52,"And so you cannot make the dead hear nor can you make the deaf hear the call when read al-du‘ā’a idhā pronouncing both hamzas or by not pronouncing the second one that comes between it and the yā’ they go away with their backs turned."
  30,53,"Nor can you guide the blind out of their error. You can only make hear in a way so as to understand and accept those who believe in Our signs in the Qur’ān and have thus submitted sincere in their affirmation of God’s Oneness."
  30,54,"God is the One Who created you from a state of weakness from a ‘base fluid’ cf. Q. 328 then He ordained after a second weakness which is the weakness of the period of childhood strength that is the strength of youth then after strength He appointed weakness again and grey hair the weakness of old age and the grey hairs of decrepitude read vocalised as du‘f ‘weakness’ in all three places. He creates what He will of weakness and strength youth and grey hairs and He is the Knower of how to manage His creatures the Omnipotent."
  30,55,"And on the Day when the Hour comes the guilty the disbelievers shall swear that they had not remained more than an hour in the grave. God exalted be He says That is how they use to be deceived how they used to be turned away from the truth — the Resurrection — similar to the way in which they have now been turned away from the real truth about how long they had remained."
  30,56,"But those who have been given knowledge and faith of angels and others shall say ‘You have remained according to God’s decree in accordance with what He had decreed for you in His prior knowledge until the Day of Resurrection. This is the Day of Resurrection which you rejected but you did not know’ that it would come to pass."
  30,57,"So on that day their excuses for denying it will not profit read lā yanfa‘u or lā tanfa‘u the evildoers nor will they be asked to make amends yusta‘tabūna means ‘they will not be asked for al-‘utbā’ which denotes ‘a return to that which pleases God’."
  30,58,"And verily We have struck We have coined for mankind in this Qur’ān every kind of similitude as a way of cautioning them. And if wa-la-in the lām is for oaths you O Muhammad (s) were to bring them a miraculous sign such as the staff or the hand in the case of Moses those who disbelieve from among them will certainly say la-yaqūlanna the indicative nūn has been omitted because of the other nūn coming after it and likewise the wāw replaced by the damma in lu because of two unvocalised consonants coming together and it indicates the plural person ‘You — in other words Muhammad (s) and his Companions — are nothing but followers of falsehood’."
  30,59,"Thus does God seal the hearts of those who do not know anything of God’s Oneness in the same way that He has sealed the hearts of these aforementioned individuals."
  30,60,"So be patient. Surely God’s promise to give you victory over them is true. And do not let them cause you to be inconstant those who are uncertain of the Resurrection in other words do not let them cause you to succumb to inconstancy and frivolity by abandoning patience that is to say do not abandon it."
