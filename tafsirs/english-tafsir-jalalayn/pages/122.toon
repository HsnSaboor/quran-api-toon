tafsir[7]{c,v,t}:
  5,83,"This verse was revealed when the Negus’s delegation from Abyssinia came to him s when the Prophet s recited sūrat Yā Sīn they cried and submitted to Islam saying ‘How similar this is to what used to be revealed to Jesus!’ God exalted be He says And when they hear what has been revealed to the Messenger of the Qur’ān you see their eyes overflow with tears because of what they recognise of the truth. They say ‘Our Lord we believe we accept the truth of your Prophet and your Book so inscribe us among the witnesses those who affirm their acceptance of the truth."
  5,84,"And in response to those Jews who reviled them for their Islam they would say why should we not believe in God and what has come to us of the truth the Qur’ān that is to say there is nothing to prevent us from faith when its prerequisites are present; and hope natma‘u is a supplement to nu’minu ‘we believe’ that our Lord should admit us with the righteous people?’ the believers into Paradise?"
  5,85,"God exalted be He says So God has rewarded them for what they have said with Gardens underneath which rivers flow wherein they will abide; that is the requital of those who are virtuous by believing."
  5,86,"But those who disbelieve and deny Our signs — they are the inhabitants of Hell-fire."
  5,87,"When a number of Companions resolved to practise fasting and night vigil continuously and to abstain from women perfume consumption of meat and sleeping on beds the following was revealed O you who believe do not forbid the good things that God has made lawful for you and do not transgress do not exceed God’s command; God does not love transgressors."
  5,88,"And eat of the lawful and good food which God has provided you halālan tayyiban ‘lawful and good food’ is the direct object and the preceding genitive construction mimmā ‘of … which’ is a circumstantial qualifier connected to the former; and fear God in Whom you are believers."
  5,89,"God will not take you to task for a slip contained in your oaths which is what the tongue utters spontaneously without intending to swear an oath such as when one says ‘No by God’ or ‘Yes by God’; but He will take you to task for that to which you have pledged read ‘aqadtum ‘aqqadttum or ‘āqadttum oaths where you have sworn an oath intentionally; the expiation thereof of the oath if you break it is the feeding of ten of the needy for each needy person one mudd measure of the midmost food from which you feed your families that is the closest or the principal food you consume neither better nor worse; or the clothing of them with what may be properly called clothes such as a shirt a turban or a loin cloth — it is not sufficient that these items mentioned be given only to one needy person according to al-Shāfi‘ī; or the setting free of a believing slave as applies in the expiation for slaying or repudiation through zihār interpreting the general stipulation in a restricted sense; and whoever does not find the means for any one of the expiations mentioned then the fasting of three days as an expiation for him — as it appears in this verse it is not obligatory to follow the above sequence of alternatives when making an expiation and this is the opinion of al-Shāfi‘ī. That which is mentioned is the expiation of your oaths if you have sworn and have broken them; but keep your oaths do not break them unless it be for a righteous deed or setting right between people as stated in the verse of sūrat al-Baqara Q. 2225. So in the same way that He has explained to you what has been mentioned God makes clear to you His signs so that you might be thankful to Him for this."
