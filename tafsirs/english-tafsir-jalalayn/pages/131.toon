tafsir[8]{c,v,t}:
  6,28,"God exalted be He says Nay — here used in order to reject the desire to believe implied by the optative exclamation — that which they used to conceal to hide before by their saying By God our Lord we were never idolaters! Q. 623 has now become evident to them as their limbs have borne witness against them and so they now wish for that mentioned in the previous verse; and even if hypothetically they were returned to the world they would return to that which they are forbidden of idolatry; they are truly liars when they promise that they would believe if they were to be returned."
  6,29,"And they those who deny the Resurrection say ‘There is no other life than our present life; we shall not be resurrected’."
  6,30,"If you could see when they are made to stand when they are presented before their Lord you would certainly see an awesome thing! He will say to them by the tongue of the angels in rebuke ‘Is this resurrection and reckoning not the truth?’ They will say ‘Yes indeed by our Lord’ it is the truth! He will say ‘Then taste the chastisement because you disbelieved’ during life on earth."
  6,31,"They indeed are losers who deny the encounter with God through resurrection until hattā is purposive to expose the extent of their mendacity when the Hour the Resurrection comes upon them suddenly they shall say ‘Alas for us yā hasratanā ‘O grief of ours’ expresses extreme suffering the vocative call to which is figurative meaning ‘Now is the time for you O grief so come forth!’ that we neglected it!’ the worldly life. On their backs they shall be bearing their burdens so that these come to them at the Resurrection in the vilest of forms and with the most putrid of smells and they ride them. Ah evil is that burden of theirs which they bear!"
  6,32,"The life of this world that is preoccupation with it is nothing but a game and a diversion while obedience and what is conducive to it are of the things of the Hereafter; surely the abode of the Hereafter wa-la’l-dāru is also read wa-la-dāru’l-ākhirati namely Paradise is better for those who fear idolatry. What do they not understand? this and so believe? read a-fa-lā ya‘qilūna ‘do they not understand’ or a-fa-lā ta‘qilūna ‘do you not understand?’."
  6,33,"We know indeed qad is a confirmative particle that it grieves you that matter which they say to you in denial; yet it is not that they deny you in secret for they know that you are truthful a variant reading for lā yukadhdhibūnaka ‘not that they deny you’ has lā yukdhibūnak that is to say ‘they do not associate you with mendacity’ but evildoers al-zālimīn replaces the previous pronominalisation ‘they’ knowingly reject deny the signs of God the Qur’ān."
  6,34,"Messengers indeed have been denied before you — herein is a consolation for the Prophet s — yet they endured patiently the denial and the persecution until Our victorious help came to them through the destruction of their peoples so be patient until the victorious help comes to you through the destruction of your people. There is none to change the words of God His promises and there has already come to you tidings of the messengers tidings through which your heart can be at peace."
  6,35,"And if their aversion to Islam is grievous too great for you on account of your concern for them then if you can seek out a hole an underground passage in the earth or a ladder a stairway to heaven that you may bring them a sign from among those they have requested then go ahead the meaning is that you will not be able to do this so be patient until God delivers His judgement — but had God willed to guide them He would have gathered them together in guidance but He did not will this and so they do not believe; so do not be among the ignorant of this matter."
