tafsir[6]{c,v,t}:
  7,38,"He exalted be He will say to them on the Day of Resurrection ‘Enter into the Fire among the number of communities of jinn and mankind who passed away before you’ fī’l-nār ‘into the Fire’ is semantically connected to udkhulū ‘enter’. Every time a community enters the Fire it curses its sister-community the one that came before it because of its having gone astray on account of it until when they have all followed caught up with one another there the last of them those who were the followers shall say to the first of them those whom they revered and followed ‘Our Lord these led us astray; so give them a double chastisement of the Fire.’ He exalted be He will say ‘For each of you and them will be a double chastisement but you do not know’ read ta‘lamūn or ya‘lamūn ‘they do not know’ what will be for each party."
  7,39,"And the first of them shall say to the last of them ‘You have no advantage over us since you did not disbelieve because of us you and we are equal in this predicament. God exalted be He says to them So taste the chastisement for what you used to earn’."
  7,40,"Those who deny Our signs and scorn them not believing in them indeed the gates of heaven shall not be opened for them when their spirits are carried up to it after death for instead they are taken down into Sijjīn cf. Q. 837f. — in contrast to the believer for whom the gates are opened and his spirit is carried up into the seventh heaven as is stated in one hadīth — nor shall they enter Paradise until the camel passes through the eye of the needle which is impossible and so is their entry into Paradise. So with this requital We requite those who are sinful through disbelief."
  7,41,"Hell shall be their bed and over them coverings of fire ghawāshin is the plural of ghāshiya and its nunation compensates for the omitted yā’. Thus do We requite the evildoers."
  7,42,"And those who believe and perform righteous deeds wa’lladhīna āmanū wa-‘amilū’l-sālihāti is the subject We do not charge any soul beyond its scope its capacity for action lā nukallifu nafsan illā wus‘ahā ‘We do not charge any soul beyond its scope’ constitutes a parenthetical statement intervening between it the above subject and its predicate which is the following those are the inhabitants of Paradise abiding therein."
  7,43,"We shall strip away all rancour all spite that existed between them in the world that is in their breasts; and beneath them beneath their palaces flow rivers; and they will say once they have settled in their dwellings ‘Praise be to God Who guided us to this action the reward of which is this Paradise; for we would surely never have been guided if God had not guided us the response to the conditional law lā ‘if … not’ is omitted because it is indicated by the preceding clause. Verily the messengers of our Lord did bring the truth.’ And it is cried to them an is read softened that is understand it as annahu; alternatively it is an explicative particle in all five places here and the four to follow ‘This is your Paradise; you have inherited it for what you used to do’."
