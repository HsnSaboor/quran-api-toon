tafsir[7]{c,v,t}:
  9,7,"How can the idolaters have a pact with God and His Messenger — they cannot —while they disbelieve in God and His Messenger acting treacherously; except for those with whom you made a pact at the Sacred Mosque? the day of al-Hudaybiyya — these were Quraysh for whom an exception was made earlier Q. 94. So long as they are true to you keeping to the pact and not breaking it be true to them by fulfilling it fa-mā ‘so long as’ the mā is a conditional particle. Truly God loves the God-fearing the Prophet s had kept to the pact made with them until they broke it by supporting the Banū Bakr against Khuzā‘a."
  9,8,"How can they have a pact when if they get the better of you if they have the upper hand over you they do not respect they do not take into consideration any bond kinship or treaty pact with regard to you but will instead harm you as much as they can the conditional sentence ‘if they …’ is also a circumstantial qualifier pleasing you with their tongues with charming words while their hearts refuse to be true to these words; and most of them are wicked violators of pacts."
  9,9,"They have purchased with the signs of God the Qur’ān a small price of this world that is they have refrained from following them in favour of passions and whims and have barred people from His way His religion. Truly evil is that deed of theirs which they are wont to do."
  9,10,"They respect neither bond of kinship nor treaty with regard to a believer; those they are the transgressors."
  9,11,"Yet if they repent and establish prayer and pay the alms then they are your brothers in religion; and We detail We explain the signs for a people who know who reflect."
  9,12,"But if they break if they violate their oaths their covenants after making their pact and assail your religion slander it then fight the leaders of unbelief its heads here an overt noun ‘the leaders of unbelief’ has replaced the third person pronominalisation — verily they have no binding oaths no pacts a variant reading for aymān ‘oaths’ has the kasra inflection for the alif sc. īmān ‘no faith’ — so that they might desist from unbelief."
  9,13,"Will you not a-lā ‘will not’ or ‘is not’ denotes incitement fight a people who broke violated their oaths their pacts and intended to expel the Messenger from Mecca — for they discussed this between them in their council assembly — initiating combat against you first? when they fought alongside Banū Bakr against Khuzā‘a your allies? So what is stopping you from fighting them? Are you afraid of them? God is more worthy of your fear when you fail to fight them if you are believers."
