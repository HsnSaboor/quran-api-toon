tafsir[8]{c,v,t}:
  33,23,"Among the believers are men who are true to the covenant they made with God in steadfastly remaining alongside the Prophet s. Some of them have fulfilled their vow having died or been killed fighting for God’s cause and some are still awaiting for this fate and they have not changed their commitment to the covenant in the least and they stand in contrast to the situation with the hypocrites;"
  33,24,"that God may reward the truthful for their truthfulness and chastise the hypocrites if He will by causing them to die in a state of hypocrisy or relent to them. Surely God is Forgiving to he who repents Merciful to him."
  33,25,"And God repulsed those who were disbelievers namely the confederates in their rage without their attaining any good without achieving their desire in any way to triumph over the believers. And God spared the believers from fighting by unleashing the wind and the angels. And truly God is Strong in bringing about what He wants Mighty prevailing with His way."
  33,26,"And He brought down those of the People of the Scripture namely the Banū Qurayza who had supported them from their strongholds sayāsī is the plural of sīsa and is that in which one fortifies himself against an enemy and He cast terror into their hearts so that some of them you slew and these were the combatants and some of them you took captive namely their children."
  33,27,"And He made you inherit their land and their homes and their possessions and a land you had not trodden thitherto and this was the territory of Khaybar which was captured after that of Qurayza. And God has power over all things."
  33,28,"O Prophet! Say to your wives — who were nine and they had asked him for some of the adornments of this world which he did not possess — ‘If you desire the life of this world and its adornment come now I will provide for you in other words the compensation to be provided for divorce and release you in a gracious manner I will divorce you and will not coerce you to stay."
  33,29,"But if you desire God and His Messenger and the Abode of the Hereafter namely Paradise then God has indeed prepared for the virtuous among you virtuous for desiring the Hereafter a great reward’ namely Paradise so choose the Hereafter over the life of this world."
  33,30,"O wives of the Prophet! Whoever of you commits manifest indecency read mubayyana or mubayyina meaning respectively ‘it has become evident’ meaning ‘one that is evident’ the chastisement shall be doubled yudā‘af a variant reading has 2nd form yuda‘‘af and still another has nuda‘‘if ‘We shall double’ in which case read al-‘adhāba as accusative for her in other words twice the chastisement for other women; and that is easy for God."
