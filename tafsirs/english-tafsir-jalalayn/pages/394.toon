tafsir[7]{c,v,t}:
  28,71,"Say to the people of Mecca ‘Have you considered in other words inform Me if God were to make the night everlasting over you until the Day of Resurrection what god other than God as you are wont to claim could bring you light? daylight hours during which you could earn a living. Will you not then listen?’ to this in a way so as to understand it and so repent of your idolatry."
  28,72,"Say to them ‘Have you considered if God were to make the day everlasting over you until the Day of Resurrection what god other than God as you are wont to claim could bring you night wherein you rest? from any weariness. Will you not then see? the error you are upon when you ascribe partners to God and so repent of it."
  28,73,"And of His mercy exalted be He He has made for you night and day that you may rest therein in the night and that you may seek in the day of His bounty to earn your livelihood that perhaps you might give thanks’ for the grace of God during both of these times."
  28,74,"And mention the day when He will call to them and say ‘Where now are My associates those whom you used to claim?’ — this is mentioned again in order to expound upon it"
  28,75,"And We shall draw bring forth from every community a witness and this will be their prophet who will bear witness against what they say and We shall say to them ‘Produce your evidence’ for the justification of the idolatry which you asserted. Then they will know that the right to divineness is God’s — none share it with Him. And that which they used to invent in this world of His having an associate exalted be He high above such associations will fail them."
  28,76,"Indeed Korah belonged to the people of Moses — being his paternal and maternal cousin and he had believed in him in Moses — but he became insolent towards them through his disdain haughtiness and great wealth. For We had given him so many treasures that the number of their keys would verily have burdened a group of strong men in other words they would have been too heavy for such men the bā’ of bi’l-‘usbati ‘a group’ is to render transitive the intransitive verb; the number of such men required is estimated to be 70 40 or 10; other estimates are also given. Mention when his people the believers among the Children of Israel said to him ‘Do not be exultant in your great wealth an exultation of insolence; truly God does not love the exultant in such things;"
  28,77,"but seek in that which God has given you of wealth the Abode of the Hereafter by expending it in obedience to God and do not forget your share of this world that is do not forget to strive in it for the sake of the Hereafter; and be good to people by giving voluntary alms just as God has been good to you. And do not seek to cause corruption in the earth by committing acts of disobedience. Surely God does not love the agents of corruption’ meaning that He will punish them."
