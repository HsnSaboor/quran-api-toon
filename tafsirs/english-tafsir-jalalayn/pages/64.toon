tafsir[7]{c,v,t}:
  3,109,"To God belongs all that is in the heavens and in the earth as possessions creatures and servants and to Him all matters are returned."
  3,110,"You O community of Muhammad (s) are the best community brought forth manifested to men according to God’s knowledge enjoining decency and forbidding indecency and believing in God. Had the People of the Scripture believed it their belief would have been better for them; some of them are believers such as ‘Abd Allāh b. Salām may God be pleased with him and his companions; but most of them the disbelievers are wicked."
  3,111,"They the Jews will not harm you O company of Muslims in any way except a little hurt with their tongues such as slander and threats; and if they fight against you they will turn their backs to you in retreat then they will not be helped against you but you will be helped against them."
  3,112,"Abasement shall be cast upon them wherever they are found so that they have no strength and no protection save if they be clinging to a rope of God and a rope of the believing people this being the latter’s covenant of security for them on the condition that they pay the jizya in other words they have no protection other than this; they have incurred they have ended up with anger from God and poverty shall be cast upon them; that is because they disbelieved in God’s signs and slew the prophets without right; that dhālika is repeated for emphasis is because they disobeyed God’s command and used to transgress passing from what is lawful into what is unlawful."
  3,113,"Yet they the People of the Scripture are not all alike equal; some of the People of the Scripture are a community upright with integrity adhering to the truth such as ‘Abd Allāh b. Salām may God be pleased with him and his companions who recite God’s verses in the watches of the night that is during its hours prostrating themselves performing prayer wa-hum yasjudūn ‘prostrating themselves’ is a circumstantial qualifier."
  3,114,"They believe in God and in the Last Day enjoining decency and forbidding indecency vying with one another in good works; those described in the way God has mentioned are of the righteous and some of them are not like this and are not righteous."
  3,115,"And whatever good you do O community taf‘alū ‘you do’ or if this is read yaf‘alū ‘they do’ then it is referring to them ‘the upright community’ you shall not be denied it read in both ways fa-lan tukfarūhu ‘you shall not be denied it’ or fa-lan yukfarūhu ‘they shall not be denied it’ you shall not be deprived of its reward but you will be rewarded for it and God knows the God-fearing."
