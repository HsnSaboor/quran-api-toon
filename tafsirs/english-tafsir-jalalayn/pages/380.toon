tafsir[9]{c,v,t}:
  27,36,"But when he the envoy came to Solomon with the gift and the servants he said ‘Are you supplying me with wealth? What God has given me of prophethood and kingship is better than what He has given you of the things of this world. Nay but it is you and not I who exult in your gift for you pride yourselves upon the possession of the ornaments of this world!"
  27,37,"Go back to them with the gifts that you have brought for We shall assuredly come to them with hosts which they will not be able to face and we shall expel them from there from the land of Sheba Saba’ — named thus after their tribal ancestor — humiliated and they shall be utterly abased’ unless they come to me in submission. When the envoy returned to her with the gift she had her throne placed inside seven doors inside her palace with her palace inside seven palaces and had all the doors locked with guards at them. She then prepared to make the journey to Solomon to see what he would command her. She departed with twelve thousand chieftains qayl each accompanied by thousands of men until when she came to within a parasang of him he sensed her arrival."
  27,38,"He said ‘O members of the council which of you regarding the two hamzas read them in the way mentioned above verse 32 will bring me her throne before they come to me in submission?’ compliant and obedient? For I may only rightfully seize it before this submission and not afterwards."
  27,39,"An afreet from among the jinn — a jinn who is powerful and stalwart — said ‘I will bring it to you before you rise from your place the one in which you sit when adjudicating — the period from morning to midday. Indeed I have the strength for it that is for carrying it and I am trustworthy’ over what it may contain of jewels and other precious things. Solomon said ‘I want something faster than that!’"
  27,40,"The one who had knowledge of the revealed Scripture — and this was one Āsif b. Barkhiyā a righteous individual with knowledge of God’s Greatest Name which when invoked in supplication for something it is immediately granted — said ‘I will bring it to you before your glance returns to you after you look at something. So he the afreet said to him ‘Look up towards the heaven’ which he did and when his glance returned in front of him he found it Bilqīs’ throne placed before him — for in the instance in which Solomon looked up to the heaven Āsif supplicated by invoking the Greatest Name that God bring it thereto; and this was done by having it travel under the earth until it sprung up below Solomon’s seat kursī. Then when he saw it standing still before him he said ‘This bringing it to me is of my Lord’s bounty that He may try me test me whether I give thanks read a-ashkur pronouncing both hamzas; or by replacing the second one with an alif; or by not pronouncing the second one but inserting an alif between the one not pronounced and the other one or without the insertion or am ungrateful for the favour. And whoever gives thanks gives thanks only for his own sake because the reward for his thanks shall be his and whoever is ungrateful for the favour should know then my Lord is surely Independent with no need of his thanks Generous’ by being bounteous to those who are ungrateful for it."
  27,41,"He said ‘Disguise her throne for her — in other words transform it such that when she sees it it will be in an unrecognisable form — that we may see whether she will be guided to recognising it or be of those who cannot be guided’ to recognise when things are transformed around them. He Solomon sought thereby to test her mind for it was said to have something wrong with it. Thus they transformed it by adding or taking away certain things and in other ways."
  27,42,"So when she came it was said to her ‘Is your throne like this?’ She said ‘It as though it is the one’. She had in fact recognised it; but she made a pretence to them just as they made a pretence to her given that when she was asked about the throne it was not said ‘Is this your throne?’ for had it been so she would have replied ‘Yes it is’. When Solomon realised that she was perceptive and knowledgeable he said ‘And we were given the knowledge before her and we had submitted to God."
  27,43,"And what she worshipped besides God that is other than Him barred her from the worship of God for she belonged to disbelieving folk’."
  27,44,"It was also said to her ‘Enter the palace hallway’ — this was a transparent white glass floor underneath which flowed sweet water that contained fish. Solomon had it made when he was told that her legs and feet resembled the shanks of a mule. And when she saw it she supposed it to be a pool of water and so she bared her legs to wade through it. Meanwhile Solomon was seated on his throne at the front part of the palace hallway and he saw that her legs and feet were in fact fair. He said to her ‘It is a hallway paved smooth with crystal’ and thereafter he called her to submit to God. She said ‘My Lord indeed I have wronged myself by worshipping other than You and I submit with Solomon to God the Lord of the Worlds’. He wanted to marry her but disliked the hair on her legs. So the devils made a depilatory lime mixture nūra and she removed it therewith. He married her and had great love for her. And he let her remain as ruler of her kingdom and would visit her once a month staying for three days every time. Her reign came to an end at the same time as that of Solomon. It is reported that he became king at the age of 13 and died at the age of 53 — Glory be to the One whose enduring sovereignty will never end!"
