tafsir[8]{c,v,t}:
  27,56,"But the only response of his people was that they said ‘Expel Lot’s family from your town. They are indeed a folk who prefer to remain pure!’ from coming unto the rears of men."
  27,57,"So We delivered him and his family except his wife — We decreed for her We made her by Our decree to be of those who remained behind in the chastisement."
  27,58,"Then We rained on them a rain — these were the stones of baked mud cf. Q. 1574 — which destroyed them. And evil indeed was their rain the rain of those who were warned against chastisement."
  27,59,"Say O Muhammad (s) ‘Praise be to God for the destruction of the disbelievers of past communities and peace be on His servants whom He has chosen’. Is God read a-Allāhu pronouncing both hamzas; or by substituting an alif for the second one; or by not pronouncing the second one but inserting an alif between the one not pronounced and the other one or without such an insertion better for those who worship Him or the partners which they ascribe? read either tushrikūna ‘you ascribe’ or yushrikūna ‘they ascribe’ they being the people of Mecca the partners they ascribe to Him in other words are such gods better for those who worship them?"
  27,60,"Or He Who created the heavens and the earth and sends down for you water from the heaven whereby We cause to grow there is a shift here from third person to that of the first person plural splendid gardens hadā’iq is the plural of hadīqa which is an enclosed garden whose trees you could never cause to grow? because of you do not have the ability for it. Is there a god a-ilāhun here and in the seven instances in which it occurs read by pronouncing both hamzas or by not pronouncing the second inserting an alif between the two in both cases with God? who has helped Him in all of this? In other words there is no god with Him. Nay but they are a people who ascribe equals to Him who associate with God others."
  27,61,"Or He Who made the earth an abode of stability that does not constantly shake beneath the feet of its inhabitants and made rivers to flow throughout it and set firm mountains for it with which He fixed the earth in place and set an isthmus between the two seas between the sweet one and the salty one the one not mixing with the other. Is there a god with God? Nay but most of them have no knowledge of His Oneness."
  27,62,"Or He Who answers the desperate one the anguished person suffering harm when he calls to Him and Who removes his distress from him and from others and makes you successors in the earth the annexation khulafā’a l-ardi ‘successors of the earth’ has the same meaning as fī ‘in’ khulafā’a fī’l-ardi ‘successors in the earth’ in other words each generation succeeding the one before it. Is there a god with God? Little do you remember little are you admonished read mā tadhakkarūna ‘do you remember’; or read yadhdhakkarūna ‘do they remember’ where in both cases the tā’ has been assimilated with the dhāl; the mā is extra used to make less what is already ‘little’."
  27,63,"Or He Who guides you shows you the way to your destinations in the darkness of the land and the sea by the stars at night and by the various landmarks during the day and Who sends forth the winds as harbingers of His mercy ahead of the rain. Is there a god with God? Exalted be God high above what others they associate with Him!"
