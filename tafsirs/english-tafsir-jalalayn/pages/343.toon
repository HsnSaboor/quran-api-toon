tafsir[10]{c,v,t}:
  23,18,"And We sent down water out of the heaven in measure that suffices them and We lodged it within the earth; and We are indeed able to take it away so that they die of thirst together with their livestock."
  23,19,"Then We produced for you therewith gardens of date palms and vines — these being the most common fruits of the Arabs — wherein is abundant fruit for you and whereof you eat in summer and winter."
  23,20,"And We produced a tree that grows on Mount of Sinai read Sīnā’ or Saynā’ indeclinable as it is a proper noun with the feminine ending denoting a location that produces read either as tunbitu from the fourth form anbata or as tanbutu from the trilateral form nabata oil bi’l-duhni in the case of the former reading of tunbitu the bā’ bi- here would be extra whereas in the case of the second reading of tanbutu it would be a preposition needed for the transitive — and this tree is the olive tree and seasoning for those who eat wa-sibghin li’l-ākilīna a supplement to bi’l-duhni ‘oil’ that is to say it is like a dye that colours a morsel dipped in it — and this seasoning is the olive oil."
  23,21,"And surely in the cattle that is in camels cows and sheep there is for you a lesson an admonition for you to heed. We give you to drink read nasqīkum or nusqīkum of what is in their bellies of milk and you have many uses in them such as the extraction of wool fur and hairs and other uses and you eat of them."
  23,22,"And on them the camels and on ships you are carried."
  23,23,"And verily We sent Noah to his people and he said ‘O my people worship God obey God and affirm His Oneness. You have no other god besides Him ghayruhu is the subject of mā ‘no’; the preceding min ilāhin ‘god’ is the predicate the min being extra. Will you not then fear?’ His punishment in worshipping gods other than Him?"
  23,24,"But the council of his people who disbelieved said to their followers ‘This is just a human being like you who desires to gain superiority to have the honour over you by acquiring followers you being his followers. And had God willed that none other than Him be worshipped He would have sent down angels with that Message and not assigned a human being for it. We never heard of such an affirmation of God’s Oneness as that which Noah summons us among our forefathers among past communities."
  23,25,"He Noah is just a man possessed by madness a case of dementia. So bear with him for a while’ until he dies."
  23,26,"He Noah said ‘My Lord help me against them because they deny me’ because of their denial of me by destroying them. God exalted be He says responding to his supplication"
  23,27,"So We revealed to him saying ‘Build the Ark the ship under Our watch under Our observation and protection and by Our revelation Our command. Then when Our command comes that they be destroyed and the oven of the baker gushes with water — and this was Noah’s sign — bring into it admit into the ship of every kind of animal two mates a male and a female that is two of every species thereof ithnayn is an object; min ‘of’ is semantically connected to usluk ‘bring into it’. According to the story God exalted be He gathered all the beasts of prey and the birds and other animals for Noah. As he Noah pushed forth his hands into each species his right hand would fall upon a male and the left upon a female whereafter he would take them on board the ship a variant reading for min kuli ‘of every’ is min kullin ‘of every kind’ in which case zawjayni ‘two mates’ becomes a direct object with ithnayn ‘two’ being repeated for emphasis thereof; together with your family — his wife ? and children — except for those against whom the Word has already gone forth that they be destroyed namely his wife and his son Canaan Kan‘ān unlike Shem Sām Ham Hām and Japheth Yāfith whom together with their three wives he carried on board. In sūrat Hūd the following is mentioned where Noah is told who he should carry in the ship ‘… and those who believe.’ And none believed with him except a few Q. 1140. It is said that these were six men and their wives. Moreover it is said that all those who were on the ship numbered seventy eight half of them were men and half were women. And do not plead with Me concerning those who have done wrong those who have disbelieved that I should refrain from destroying them. They shall indeed be drowned."
