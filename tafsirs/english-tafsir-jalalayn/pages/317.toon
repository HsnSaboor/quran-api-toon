So he fulfilled what he had been commanded and God made the ground dry so that they were able to pass through it. Do not fear to be overtaken that is fearing that Pharaoh might catch you and do not be afraid’ of drowning."
  20,78,"Then Pharaoh pursued them with his hosts with him Pharaoh alongside them and there engulfed them what did engulf them of the sea and it drowned them."
  20,79,"And Pharaoh led his people astray by calling them to worship him and he did not guide them nay he led them to destruction in contrast to what he said to them and I guide you only to the path of rectitude Q. 4029."
  20,80,"O Children of Israel truly We delivered you from your enemy Pharaoh by drowning him and We made a tryst with you on the right side of the Tūr Mount in order to give Moses the Torah that it may be implemented it by you and We sent down to you manna and quails namely turunjabīn citrus fruit and the quail. The ones being addressed in the vocative by ‘O Children of Israel’ are those Jews living at the time of the Prophet s and they are addressed with reference to the graces which God bestowed on their forefathers at the time of the prophet Moses as a preface to what God now says to them"
  20,81,"‘Eat of the good things We have provided you that is to say of that which has been bestowed on you as a grace from God but do not transgress regarding it by being ungrateful for the grace thereof lest My wrath descend on you if read fa-yahilla it means ‘lest it My wrath become incumbent upon you’; or if read fa-yuhilla it means ‘lest it descend on you’.

  20,84,"He said ‘They are close behind me coming upon my track and I hastened to You my Lord that You may be pleased’ with me in other words to please you even more — before giving the response he gives an excuse according to what he supposed was the situation with his people"
  20,85,"But those he supposed to be following him had remained behind for He exalted be He said ‘Indeed We tried your people after you that is after your departure from them and the Samaritan led them astray’ so they took to worshipping the golden calf."
  20,86,"Thereupon Moses returned to his people angry with them and sad extremely grieved. He said ‘O my people did not your Lord promise you a fair promise? that is a true promise that He will give you the Torah?
