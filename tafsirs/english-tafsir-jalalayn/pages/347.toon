  23,76,"And We have already seized them with chastisement with hunger yet they did not humble themselves to their Lord nor did they devote themselves to prayer nor did they seek the pleasure of God through supplication."

  23,80,"And He it is Who gives life by breathing the Spirit into the embryo mudgha and brings death and due to Him is the alternation of night and day in darkness and brightness and through increase and diminution. Will you not then comprehend? His handiwork exalted be He and so reflect?"
  23,81,"Nay but they say the like of what the ancients said."
  23,82,"They the ancients said ‘What when we are dead and have become dust and bones shall we then be raised? No! the two hamzas in each of the two instances are either pronounced fully or with the second one not pronounced but with an alif inserted between the two hamzas in both readings."
