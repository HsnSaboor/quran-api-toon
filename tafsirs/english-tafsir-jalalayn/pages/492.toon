Yet surely wa-in in is softened from the hardened form inna all that would be nothing read lamā with the mā as extra; or read lammā to mean ‘but’ making the particle in for negation but the transient enjoyment of the life of this world enjoyed during it but then perishes and the Hereafter Paradise with your Lord is for the God-fearing."
