  22,16,"So just as We revealed the previous verse We revealed it that is the remainder of the Qur’ān as clear signs manifest signs bayyināt ‘clear signs’ is a circumstantial qualifier and indeed God guides whomever He desires that he be guided wa-anna’Llāha yahdī man yurīdu a supplement to the suffixed pronoun hā’ ‘it’ of anzalnāhu ‘We revealed it’."
  22,17,"Truly those who believe and those of Jewry namely the Jews and the Sabaeans a sect from among them and the Christians and the Magians and the polytheists — God will indeed judge between them on the Day of Resurrection by admitting the believers into Paradise and all others into the Fire.

  22,18,"Have you not seen have you not realised that to God prostrate whoever is in the heavens and whoever is in the earth together with the sun and the moon and the stars and the mountains and the trees and the animals that is how they are submissive to Him in what He wills of them as well as many of mankind? namely the believers who prostrate to Him in addition to their submissiveness to Him when prostrating in prayer. And for many the chastisement has become due and these are the disbelievers for they refuse to prostrate an action which is contingent on belief. And he whom God abases he whom He makes unprosperous there is none to give him honour none to make him fortunate. Indeed God does whatever He will in the way of abasing or giving honour."
