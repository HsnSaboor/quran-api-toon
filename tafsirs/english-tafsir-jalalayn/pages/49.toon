tafsir[4]{c,v,t}:
  2,283,"And if you are upon a journey travelling and you contract a debt and you do not find a writer then a pledge ruhun or rihān plural of rahn in hand as a guarantee for you. The Sunna clarifies the permissibility of making pledges in towns where writers may be forthcoming; but the stipulation is made in the event of travel because in this case it is more important to have a guarantee; God’s reference to it being ‘in hand’ maqbūda is a condition for the pledge given to be valid and to satisfy the pledgee or his representative. But if one of you the creditor trusts another the debtor over the debt and does not require a pledge let him who is trusted the debtor deliver his trust the debt; and let him fear God his Lord when delivering it. And do not conceal the testimony if you are summoned to give it; whoever conceals it his heart is sinful the heart is mentioned because it is the locus of the testimony and because if it sins there are other sinful consequences and so the person will be punished as though he were a sinner; and God knows what you do nothing of which can be hidden from Him."
  2,284,"To God belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth. Whether you disclose manifest what is in your hearts or hide it of evil and resolve for it God shall take you to account for it informing you of it on the Day of Resurrection. Then He will forgive whom He will to forgive and chastise whom He will to chastise both verbs are apocopated fa-yaghfir ‘he will forgive’ wa-yu‘adhdhib ‘he will chastise’ if taken as the responses to the conditional in tubdū ‘if you proclaim’; but they may also be read with a final nominative inflection yaghfiru yu‘adhdhibu in which case it would constitute a new clause and follow on from an implicit fa-huwa ‘then He’. And God has power over all things including reckoning with you and requiting you."
  2,285,"The Messenger Muhammad (s) believes in affirms the truth of what was revealed to him from his Lord namely the Qur’ān and the believers wa’l-mu’minūna is a supplement to al-rasūlu ‘the Messenger’; each one the tanwīn of kullun stands in place of the second noun in an annexation sc. kullu wāhidin believes in God and His angels and in His Books all of them and each of them and His messengers and they say ‘we make no distinction between any of His messengers’ believing in some and disbelieving in others in the manner of the Jews and the Christians. And they say ‘We hear what we have been enjoined to hear and accept and obey; we ask you Your forgiveness our Lord; to You is the homecoming’ that is the return at the Resurrection. When the previous verse was revealed the believers complained of evil whisperings and it grieved them that they should be taken to account according to the principle expressed in it and so the following was revealed"
  2,286,"God charges no soul save to its capacity that is what it is capable of bearing; for it is what it has merited of good and its reward and against it is what it has earned of evil and its burden no person shall be requited for another’s sin or for what he has not earned even if he was tempted to do it. Say Our Lord take us not to task by way of chastisement if we forget or err by straying from the right path unknowingly — as You used to take to task those before us God has lifted this burden from this community as reported in hadīth. The petition here then is a way of acknowledging God’s favour; our Lord burden us not with a load an affair which we cannot bear such as You did lay upon those before us namely upon the Children of Israel as for example the killing of oneself in repentance the paying of a quarter of one’s property for alms and the severing of the impure part. Our Lord do not burden us beyond what we have the power the strength to bear of obligations and trials; and pardon us effacing our sins and forgive us and have mercy on us with mercy added to Your forgiveness; You are our Patron our Master and the Guardian of our affairs; so grant us assistance against the disbelieving folk by establishing definitive proof for us and victory over them in battle for it is expected of a patron that he assist his clients against their enemies. In a hadīth it is stated that when this verse was revealed and the Prophet s was reciting it after each word it was said to him “Granted”."
