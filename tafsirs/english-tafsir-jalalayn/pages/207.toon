tafsir[7]{c,v,t}:
  9,123,"O you who believe fight those of the disbelievers who are near to you that is the nearest followed by the next nearest of them and let them find harshness in you that is severity in other words be harsh with them and know that God is with the pious helping and granting them victory."
  9,124,"And whenever a sūra of the Qur’ān is revealed there are some of them that is the hypocrites who say to their companions mockingly ‘Which of you has this increased in faith?’ and God says As for those who believe it has increased them in faith because they accept that it is true and they rejoice because of it."
  9,125,"But as for those in whose hearts is sickness a weakness of faith it only adds abomination to their abomination that is it only adds disbelief to their disbelief since they disbelieve in it and they die while they were disbelievers."
  9,126,"Do they not see that is the hypocrites in which case read a-wa-lā yarawna; or if read a-wa-lā tarawna ‘do you O believers not see’ that they are tested afflicted every year once or twice? with drought and diseases. Still they do not repent of their hypocrisy nor do they remember nor do they heed admonition."
  9,127,"And whenever a sūra is revealed wherein is mention of them and the Prophet s recites it they look at one another desiring to flee and saying ‘Will anyone see you?’ if you get up and flee? and so if no one can see them they get up and leave otherwise they stay put. Then they turn away persisting in their disbelief. God turns their hearts away from guidance because they are a folk who do not understand the truth for they do not reflect on it."
  9,128,"Verily there has come to you a messenger from among yourselves that is one of you — Muhammad (s) — for whom it is grievous hard that you should suffer that is your suffering your experiencing hardship and encountering harm is hard on him; who is full of concern for you that you should be rightly guided; to the believers full of pity profoundly compassionate merciful desiring good for them."
  9,129,"So if they turn away refraining from believing in you say ‘God suffices me. There is no god except Him. Upon Him I rely in Him have I put my trust and in none other and He is the Lord of the Tremendous Throne’ al-‘arsh al-azīm the kursī which is singled out for mention because it is the greatest of all things created. Al-Hākim reported in al-Mustadrak by way of an isnād from Ubayy b. Ka‘b that he Ubayy said ‘The last verse to be revealed was from Verily there has come to you a messenger… to the end of the sūra’ sc. Q. 9128-129."
