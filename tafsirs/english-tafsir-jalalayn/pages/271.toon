tafsir[8]{c,v,t}:
  16,35,"And the idolaters from among the Meccans say ‘Had God willed we would not have worshipped anything besides Him — neither we nor our fathers — nor would we have deemed anything sacred besides Him’ in the way of those camels called bahīras and sā’iba. In other words our idolatry and our deeming these animals sacred are effected by His will; therefore He must be satisfied with this. God exalted He be says So did those before them that is they denied their messengers regarding that which they the messengers brought them. Yet are messengers charged with anything save plain conveyance of the Message? It is not their duty to guide."
  16,36,"And verily We sent forth among every community a messenger just as We have sent you forth among these Meccans to say ‘Worship God profess belief in His Oneness and shun false deities’ graven images and do not worship them. Then among them were some whom God guided and they believed and among them were some who deserved to be in error according to God’s knowledge and so they did not believe. So travel O disbelievers of Mecca in the land and observe the nature of the consequence of those who denied their messengers in that they were destroyed."
  16,37,"If you O Muhammad (s) are eager for them to be guided when God has already made them go astray you will not be able to achieve this For God does not guide read passive lā yuhdā ? or active lā yahdī he whom He has already sent astray he whom He desires to send astray and they will have no helpers no protectors from God’s chastisement."
  16,38,"And they swear by God their most earnest oaths in other words with their utmost earnestness therein that God will not resurrect the dead. God exalted be He says Nay He will resurrect them it is a promise binding upon Him both wa‘dan and haqqan are verbal nouns used for emphasis and are in the accusative because of the verbal actions implicit in them; in other words He promised that and made it a binding truth but most people that is the people of Mecca do not know that."
  16,39,"That He may make clear to them li-yubayyina is semantically connected to an implied yab‘athuhum ‘He will resurrect them’ what they differ with believers in of matters of religion by punishing them and rewarding the believers and that the disbelievers may know that they were liars when they denied the Resurrection."
  16,40,"All that We say to a thing when We will it that is when We will that it come into existence qawlunā is a subject the predicate of which is what follows is to say to it ‘Be’ and it is in other words and that thing is a variant reading for fa-yakūnu has fa-yakūna as a supplement to naqūla. The verse is intended as an affirmation of the power of God to resurrect."
  16,41,"And those who emigrated for God’s cause to establish His religion after they had been wronged through harm those from among the people of Mecca — these were the Prophet s and his Companions — truly We shall lodge them in this world in a goodly lodging namely Medina and the reward of the Hereafter that is Paradise is surely greater grander did they but know that is the disbelievers — or those who stayed behind and did not emigrate — did they but know the honour that belongs to emigrants they would have followed them."
  16,42,"They are those who endure the harm inflicted by the idolaters and endure the emigration in order to make manifest the religion and put their trust in their Lord so that He provides for them whence they do not reckon."
