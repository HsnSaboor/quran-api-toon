  46,21,"And mention the brother of ‘Ād namely Hūd peace be upon him when idh … from here to the end of the verse constitutes an inclusive substitution he warned his people he threatened them at Ahqāf ‘the Sand dunes’ is the name of a valley in Yemen where their dwellings were located — and already warners messengers had passed away before him and after him that is to say before Hūd came to them and after him to their peoples — saying ‘Do not worship anyone but God the statement beginning with wa-qad khalat ‘and already warners had passed away’ is a parenthetical one. Truly I fear for you — should you worship other than God — the chastisement of a dreadful day’."
  46,22,"They said ‘Have you come to divert us from our gods? to turn us away from worship of them. Then bring us what you threaten us with of chastisement for worshipping them if you are of the truthful’ in saying that it will befall us."
  46,23,"He Hūd said ‘The knowledge is with God only He is the One Who knows when chastisement will befall you and I am merely conveying to you what I have been sent with to you. But I see that you are an ignorant lot’ given your hastening on of the chastisement."
  46,24,"Then when they saw it that is when they saw what chastisement really was as a sudden cloud a cloud that appeared out of nowhere on the horizon heading towards their valleys they said ‘This is a cloud that will bring us rain!’. God exalted be He says Nay but it is what you sought to hasten of the chastisement — a hurricane rīhun substitutes for mā ‘what’ containing a painful chastisement"
  46,25,"destroying ruining everything it passes through by the command of its Lord by His will that is to say destroying everything that He wants to destroy with it. And so it destroyed their men women children and properties by flinging them up into the air high above the ground and tearing them to pieces. Only Hūd and those who believed with him remained unscathed. So they became such that nothing could be seen except their dwellings. Thus in the way that We requited them do We requite guilty folk besides them."
  46,26,"And verily We had empowered them in ways in which We have not in is either for negation or extra empowered you O people of Mecca in the way of strength and means and We had vested them with ears and eyes and hearts. But their ears and their eyes and their hearts did not avail them in any way min shay’in min is extra since idh is operated by aghnā ‘avail’ and imbued with the sense of a particle introducing a reason they used to deny the signs of God His clear proofs and they were besieged by there befell them what they used to deride of chastisement."
  46,27,"And We certainly destroyed the towns that were around you that is We destroyed their inhabitants the likes of Thamūd ‘Ād and the people of Lot and We dispensed the signs We repeated the clear proofs so that perhaps they might return."
  46,28,"So why did they not help them by averting from them the chastisement those whom they had chosen besides God that is to say other than Him as a means of nearness through whom they may secure nearness to God to be gods? alongside Him and these are the idols the first object of ittakhadhū ‘they had chosen’ is the omitted pronoun referred to by the relative clause alladhīna ‘those who …’ and it is hum ‘they’; qurbānan ‘nearness’ is the second object with ālihatan ‘gods’ as its substitution. Nay but they forsook them when the chastisement came down on them and that that is to say that choosing of theirs of idols as gods as a means of nearness to God was their lie and what they used to invent — the lies they used to speak mā ‘what’ either relates to the verbal action ‘their lying’ or it indicates a relative clause with the referential pronoun omitted this being fīhi ‘about’."
