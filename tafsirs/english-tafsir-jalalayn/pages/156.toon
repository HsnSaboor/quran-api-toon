tafsir[8]{c,v,t}:
  7,44,"And the inhabitants of Paradise will call to the inhabitants of the Fire either in affirmation or in reprimand ‘We have found that which our Lord promised us in the way of reward to be true; have you found that chastisement which your Lord promised you to be true?’ They will say ‘Yes!’ And then a crier a caller shall proclaim between them between both parties making them hear that ‘God’s curse is on the evildoers"
  7,45,"who bar people from God’s way from His religion desiring it that is they seek the way that is crooked disbelieving in the Hereafter’."
  7,46,"And between them that is between the inhabitants of Paradise and those of the Fire is a veil a barrier said to be the wall of the Heights and on the Heights which is the wall of Paradise are men whose good deeds and evil deeds are equal as is stated in the hadīth who know each of the inhabitants of Paradise and those of the Fire by their mark — glowing faces in the case of the believers and blackened ones in the case of the disbelievers for they are able to see them their position being high — and they call to the inhabitants of Paradise ‘Peace be upon you!’ God exalted be He says They that is those men of the Heights have not entered it Paradise although they aspire to enter it. Al-Hasan al-Basrī said ‘God causes them to have this aspiration only because He desires to be generous to them’. Al-Hākim reported that Hudhayfa b. al-Yamān said ‘While they are in this situation God appears to them and says “Get up and enter Paradise for I have forgiven you”.’"
  7,47,"And when their eyes those of the men of the Heights are turned towards in the direction of the inhabitants of the Fire they shall say ‘Our Lord do not assign us to the Fire with the evildoing folk’."
  7,48,"And those of the Heights call to men from among the inhabitants of the Fire whom they know by their mark saying ‘Your masses of property or your multitude and your haughtiness that is your disdaining of belief have not availed you as protection against the Fire. And they also say to them pointing to those formerly oppressed Muslims"
  7,49,"Are these the ones of whom you swore that God would never grant them mercy?’ it has already been said to them ‘Enter Paradise; no fear shall come upon you nor shall you grieve’ a variant reading for udkhulū ‘enter’ imperative second person plural has the passive udkhilū ‘they have been admitted’ or dakhalū ‘they entered’; the negation clause ‘no fear shall come upon you nor shall you grieve’ is a circumstantial qualifier in other words they enter Paradise while this is being said to them."
  7,50,"And the inhabitants of the Fire call out to the inhabitants of Paradise saying ‘Pour on us some water or some of that food which God has provided you!’ They say ‘God has forbidden He has prohibited both to the disbelievers"
  7,51,"those who took their religion for a diversion and a game and whom the life of this world has deluded.’ Therefore today We have forgotten them We have left them in the Fire just as they forgot the encounter of this day of theirs when they neglected to perform good deeds for it and because they used to deny Our signs."
