tafsir[8]{c,v,t}:
  4,106,"And pray for forgiveness from God for that which you considered doing; surely God is ever Forgiving Merciful."
  4,107,"And do not dispute on behalf of those who betray themselves through acts of disobedience for the evil consequences of their betrayal shall fall on them; surely God loves not one who is treacherous frequently betraying and sinful that is to say He will punish him."
  4,108,"They the likes of Tu‘ma and his clan hide themselves in shame from people but they do not hide themselves from God; for He is with them in His knowledge of them while they plot they conspire at night with discourse displeasing to Him in their resolve to swear by God and deny the theft and accuse the Jew of it. God is ever Encompassing in knowledge of what they do."
  4,109,"Ah! There you are addressing Tu‘ma’s clan you have contested you have disputed on their behalf that is to say on behalf of Tu‘ma and his men a variant reading has ‘anhu ‘on his behalf’ in the life of this world; but who will contest against God on their behalf on the Day of Resurrection if He were to punish them or who will be a guardian for them and take charge of their affair or defend them? In other words no one will do such a thing."
  4,110,"Whoever does evil commits a sin by which another is harmed as when Tu‘ma falsely accused the Jew or wrongs himself committing a sin the consequences of which are limited to him and then prays for God’s forgiveness for it that is to say and then he repents he shall find God is Forgiving Merciful to him."
  4,111,"And whoever commits a sin commits it against himself only since the evil consequences fall on him harming no one else; and God is ever Knower Wise in His actions."
  4,112,"And whoever commits a mistake a minor sin or a sin a grave sin and then casts it upon the innocent one who is innocent of it he has thereby burdened himself with calumny by his false accusation and a manifest sin one which is evident on account of what he has committed."
  4,113,"Were it not for God’s bounty to you O Muhammad (s) and His mercy by way of protecting you a party of them of Tu‘ma’s clan would have intended would have conspired to lead you astray from judging with truth by deceiving you; but they lead only themselves astray; they will not hurt you at all since the evil consequence of their leading you astray would have fallen on them. God has revealed to you the Book the Qur’ān and wisdom the rulings contained therein and He has taught you what you did not know of rulings and the Unseen; and God’s bounty to you in this and other respects is ever great."
