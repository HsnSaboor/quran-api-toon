tafsir[5]{c,v,t}:
  5,32,"Because of that which Cain did We decreed for the Children of Israel that whoever slays a soul for other than a soul slain or for other than corruption committed in the land in the way of unbelief fornication or waylaying and the like it shall be as if he had slain mankind altogether; and whoever saves the life of one by refraining from slaying it shall be as if he had saved the life of all mankind — Ibn ‘Abbās said that the above is meant in the sense of violating and protecting its a soul’s sanctity respectively. Our messengers have already come to them that is to the Children of Israel with clear proofs miracles but after that many of them still commit excesses in the land overstepping the bounds through disbelief killing and the like."
  5,33,"The following was revealed when the ‘Arniyyūn came to Medina suffering from some illness and the Prophet s gave them permission to go and drink from the camels’ urine and milk. Once they felt well they slew the Prophet’s shepherd and stole the herd of camels Truly the only requital of those who fight against God and His Messenger by fighting against Muslims and hasten about the earth to do corruption there by waylaying is that they shall be slaughtered or crucified or have their hands and feet cut off on opposite sides that is their right hands and left feet or be banished from the land the aw ‘or’ is used to indicate the separate application of each of the cases listed; thus death is for those that have only killed; crucifixion is for those that have killed and stolen property; the cutting off of limbs on opposite sides is for those that have stolen property but have not killed; while banishment is for those that pose a threat — this was stated by Ibn ‘Abbās and is the opinion of al-Shāfi‘ī; the more sound of his al-Shāfi‘ī’s two opinions is that crucifixion should be for three days after the death of the killer or it is also said shortly before he is killed; with banishment are included similar punishments such as imprisonment and the like. That mentioned requital is a degradation a humiliation for them in this world; and in the Hereafter theirs will be a great chastisement namely the chastisement of the Fire."
  5,34,"Except for such warmongers and waylayers as repent before you overpower them; for know that God is Forgiving to them of what they have done Merciful to them. This proviso is expressed without any statement to the effect ‘do not submit them to prescribed legal punishment’ to point out that when such a person repents only God’s prescribed punishments hudūd — and not those deriving from the rights of human beings — are waived. This is how I see it. I do not know of any that have tackled this topic and God knows best. If then a person has killed and stolen property he should be killed and have his limbs cut off on opposite sides but not crucified — this is the more sound of two opinions held by al-Shāfi‘ī. However his repentance is of no avail once he has been overpowered by the authorities — this is also the more sound of two opinions held by him."
  5,35,"O you who believe fear God fear His chastisement by being obedient to Him and seek the means to Him that obedience which brings you closer to Him and struggle in His way in order to elevate His religion; so that you might prosper triumph."
  5,36,"Truly as for the disbelievers if they possessed definitely all that is in the earth and the like of it with it by which to ransom themselves from the chastisement of the Day of Resurrection it would not be accepted from them; theirs shall be a painful chastisement."
