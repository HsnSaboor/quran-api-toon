tafsir[8]{c,v,t}:
  2,30,"And mention O Muhammad (s) when your Lord said to the angels ‘I am appointing on earth a vicegerent’ who shall act as My deputy by implementing My rulings therein — and this vicegerent was Adam; They said ‘What will You appoint therein one who will do corruption therein through disobedience and shed blood spilling it through killing just as the progeny of the jinn did for they used to inhabit it but when they became corrupted God sent down the angels against them and they were driven away to islands and into the mountains; while we glorify continuously You with praise that is “We say Glory and Praise be to You” and sanctify You?’ that is ‘We exalt You as transcendent above what does not befit You?; the lām of laka ‘You’ is extra and the sentence wa-nuqaddisu laka ‘We sanctify You’ is a circumstantial qualifier the import being ‘thus we are more entitled to be Your vicegerents’; He exalted be He said ‘Assuredly I know what you know not’ of the benefits of making Adam a vicegerent and of the fact that among his progeny will be the obedient and the transgressor and justice will prevail between them. They said ‘God will never create anything more noble in His eyes than us nor more knowledgeable since we have been created before it and have seen what it has not seen. God then created Adam from the surface of the earth adīm al-ard adīm literally means ‘skin’ taking a handful of all its colours and mixing it with different waters then made him upright and breathed into him the Spirit and he thus became a living being with senses after having been inanimate."
  2,31,"And He taught Adam the names that is the names of things named all of them by placing knowledge of them into his heart; then He presented them these names the majority of which concerned intellectual beings to the angels and said to them in reproach ‘Now tell Me inform Me the names of these things named if you speak truly’ in your claim that I would not create anything more knowledgeable than you or that you are more deserving of this vicegerency; the response to the conditional sentence is intimated by what precedes it."
  2,32,"They said ‘Glory be to You! exalting You above that any should object to You We know not except what You have taught us. Surely You are innaka anta emphasises the preceding suffixed pronoun kāf the Knower Wise’ from whose knowledge and wisdom nothing escapes."
  2,33,"He exalted be He said ‘Adam tell them the angels their names’ all of the things named; so he named each thing by its appellation and mentioned the wisdom behind its creation; And when he had told them their names He exalted said in rebuke ‘Did I not tell you that I know the Unseen in the heavens and the earth? what is unseen in them And I know what you reveal what you manifested when you said ‘What will You appoint therein …’ and what you were hiding what you were keeping secret when you were saying that God would not create anything more knowledgeable or more noble in His eyes than us."
  2,34,"And mention when We said to the angels ‘Prostrate yourselves to Adam’ a prostration that is a bow of salutation; so they prostrated themselves except Iblīs the father of the jinn who was among the angels he refused to prostrate and disdained became proud and said I am better than he Q. 712; and so he became one of the disbelievers according to God’s knowledge."
  2,35,"And We said ‘Adam dwell anta ‘you’ of ‘dwell you’ here reiterates the concealed pronoun of the person of the verb uskun so that it wa-zawjuk may be made a supplement to it; and your wife Eve Hawwā’ — who was created from his left rib — in the Garden and eat thereof of its food easefully of anything without restrictions where you desire; but do not come near this tree to eat from it and this was wheat or a vine or something else lest you be become evildoers’ that is transgressors."
  2,36,"Then Satan Iblīs caused them to slip he caused them to be removed fa-azallahumā a variant reading has fa-azālahumā he caused them to be away from it therefrom that is from the Garden when he said to them ‘Shall I point you to the tree of eternity’ cf. Q. 20120 and swore to them by God that he was only giving good advice to them and so they ate of it; and brought them out of what they were in of bliss; and We said ‘Go down to earth both of you and all those comprised by your seed; some of you of your progeny an enemy to the other through your wronging one another; and in the earth a dwelling a place of settlement shall be yours and enjoyment of whatever of its vegetation you may enjoy for a while’ until the time your terms of life are concluded."
  2,37,"Thereafter Adam received certain words from his Lord with which He inspired him a variant reading of Ādamu has accusative Ādama and nominative kalimātu meaning they the words came to him and these were those of the verse Lord we have wronged ourselves Q. 723 with which he supplicated and He relented to him that is He accepted his repentance; truly He is the Relenting to His servants the Merciful to them."
