  39,48,"And there will appear to them the evils of what they had earned and they will be besieged by there will descend on them that which they used to deride in other words the chastisement."
  39,49,"So when some distress befalls man al-insān here a generic he supplicates Us. Then when We bestow on him a grace from Us he says ‘I was given it merely by force of knowledge’ from God that I was deserving of it. Nay but it this saying is a trial a test by which servants are tested. But most of them do not know that such bestowal of grace is a way of drawing them on and a test of their faith."
