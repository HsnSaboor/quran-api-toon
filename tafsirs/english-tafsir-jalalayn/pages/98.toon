  4,122,"But those who believe and perform righteous deeds We shall admit them to Gardens underneath which rivers flow abiding therein for ever; God’s promise in truth that is God promised them this and fulfilled it in truth; and who that is and none is truer in utterance that is in statement than God?"
  4,123,"When the Muslims and the People of the Scripture began to pride themselves upon God’s promise the following was revealed It this matter is not dependent upon your desires nor the desires of the People of the Scripture but upon righteous deeds. Whoever does evil shall be requited for it either in the Hereafter or in this life through trials and tribulations as is stated in hadīth; and he will not find besides God that is other than Him any friend to protect him or helper to defend him against Him."
  4,124,"And whoever does any righteous deeds whether male or female and is a believer — such shall be admitted into read passive yudkhalūna or active yadkhulūna ‘they shall enter’ Paradise and not be wronged by as much as the dint in a date-stone."
  4,125,"And who that is and none is fairer in religion than he who submits his purpose that is than he who is compliant and offers his deeds sincerely to God and is virtuous and declares God’s Oneness and who follows the creed of Abraham the one that is in accordance with the creed of Islam as a hanīf? hanīfan is a circumstantial qualifier that is to say one inclining away from all religions to the upright religion. And God took Abraham for a close friend as His elect one whose love for Him is pure."
  4,126,"To God belongs all that is in the heavens and in the earth as possessions creatures and servants; and God is ever the Encompasser of all things in knowledge and power that is He is ever possessed of such attributes."
  4,127,"They will ask you for a pronouncement concerning the matter of women and their inheritance. Say to them ‘God pronounces to you concerning them and what is recited to you in the Book the Qur’ān in the ‘inheritance’ verse Q. 411 and He also pronounces to you concerning the orphan women to whom you do not give what is prescribed what is obligatory for them of inheritance for you O guardians who desire not to marry them because of their ugliness and you prevent them from marrying others coveting their inheritance in other words God pronounces to you not to do this; and concerning the oppressed young children that you give them what is their due and He also commands you that you deal justly equitably with orphans with respect to inheritance and dowry. Whatever good you do God is ever Knower of it’ and He will requite you for it."
