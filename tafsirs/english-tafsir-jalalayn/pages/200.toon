tafsir[7]{c,v,t}:
  9,80,"Ask forgiveness for them O Muhammad (s) or do not ask forgiveness for them this leaves the choice of asking forgiveness or refraining up to him; the Prophet s said ‘I have been given the choice and I made it’ meaning the choice to ask forgiveness as reported by al-Bukhārī. If you ask forgiveness for them seventy times God will not forgive them it is said that the ‘seventy’ is intended to express by hyperbole a great frequency of asking forgiveness. In the Sahīh of al-Bukhārī there is a hadīth which states ‘If I was sure that were I to ask more than seventy times God would forgive them I would have done so’. It is also said however that the very number seventy is actually meant on account of this other hadīth of his ‘I shall ask more than seventy times’ whereupon it was made clear to him the Prophet that the matter regarding forgiveness had been concluded by the verse Q. 636 Alike it will be regarding them whether you ask forgiveness for them or you do not ask forgiveness for them God will not forgive them; that is because they disbelieved in God and His Messenger; and God does not guide the wicked folk."
  9,81,"Those who were left behind from the journey to Tabūk rejoiced at remaining behind the Messenger of God and were averse to striving with their wealth and their lives in the way of God. And they said that is they said to one another ‘Do not go forth do not set off to join the fight in the heat!’ Say ‘The fire of Hell is hotter than Tabūk and more worthy for them to guard against by not staying behind did they but understand’ this they would not have stayed behind."
  9,82,"But let them laugh a little in this world and weep much in the Hereafter as a requital for what they used to earn the sentence is predicative of their state expressed in the form of an imperative."
  9,83,"So if God brings you back from Tabūk to a party of them of those hypocrites who stayed behind in Medina and they ask leave of you to go forth with you on some other campaign say to them ‘You shall never more go forth with me and you shall never fight with me against an enemy. You were content to stay behind the first time so stay behind with those who stay behind’ away from military campaigns such as women and children and others."
  9,84,"When the Prophet s prayed over the dead body of ‘Abd Allāh Ibn Ubayy the following was revealed And never pray over any one of them when he is dead nor stand over his grave at a burial or as a visit; lo! they disbelieved in God and His Messenger and died while they were wicked they died disbelieving."
  9,85,"And let not their wealth and their children please you; God desires only to chastise them thereby in this world and that their souls should depart while they are disbelievers."
  9,86,"And when a sūra that is a section of the Qur’ān is revealed saying ‘Believe in God and strive with His Messenger’ the affluent among them ask leave of you saying ‘Leave us to be with those who sit at home’."
