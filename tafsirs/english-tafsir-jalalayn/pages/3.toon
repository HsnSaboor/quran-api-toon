tafsir[11]{c,v,t}:
  2,6,"As for the disbelievers the likes of Abū Jahl Abū Lahab and such; alike it is for them whether you have warned them or have not warned them they do not believe as God knows very well so do not hope that they will believe read a-andhartahum pronouncing both hamzas or by not pronouncing the second making it an alif instead and inserting an alif between the one not pronounced and the other one or leaving this insertion; al-indhār ‘warning’ is to give knowledge of something and simultaneously instil an element of fear."
  2,7,"God has set a seal on their hearts impressing on them and making certain that no good enters them; and on their hearing in which He has deposited something so that they cannot profit from the truth they hear; and on their eyes is a covering that is a veil so that they do not see the truth; and for them there will be a mighty chastisement that is intense and everlasting."
  2,8,"The following was revealed concerning the hypocrites and some people there are who say ‘We believe in God and the Last Day’ that is in the Day of Resurrection because it is the very last day; but they are not believers the plural import of man in man yaqūl ‘who says’ is taken into account here as expressed by a pronoun hum that expresses this plural meaning."
  2,9,"They would deceive God and the believers by manifesting the opposite of the unbelief they hide so that they can avoid His rulings in this world; and only themselves they deceive yukhādi‘ūn for the evil consequences of their deception will rebound upon them as they are disgraced in this world when God makes known to His Prophet what they are hiding and they will be punished in the Hereafter; and they are not aware and they do not know that they are actually deceiving themselves mukhāda‘a although a third verbal form from khāda‘a actually denotes a one-way action such as when one says ‘āqabtu al-lissa ‘I punished the thief’ using the third verbal form ‘āqaba; the mention of ‘God’ in this statement is for rhetorical effect; a variant reading for wa-mā yukhādi‘ūna has wa-mā yakhda‘ūna."
  2,10,"In their hearts is a sickness doubt and hypocrisy which ails their hearts debilitating them; and God has increased their sickness with what He has revealed in the Qur’ān since they disbelieve it; and there awaits them a painful chastisement because they used to lie read yukadhdhibūn to imply that they used to call the Prophet of God a liar or yakdhibūn to imply their mendacity when saying ‘we believe’."
  2,11,"When it is said to them that is these latter ‘Do not spread corruption in the land’ through unbelief and hindering people from faith They say ‘We are only putting things right’ that is ‘we are not engaging in corruption’. God exalted be He refutes them saying"
  2,12,"Truly a-lā ‘truly’ is for alerting intended emphatically they are the agents of corruption but they perceive this not."
  2,13,"When it is said to them ‘Believe as the people believe’ that is as the Companions of the Prophet s They say ‘Shall we believe as fools believe?’ that is as the ignorant do? No we do not follow their way. The exalted One refutes them saying Truly they are the foolish ones but they know this not."
  2,14,"When they meet laqū is actually laquyū but the damma has been omitted being too cumbersome for pronunciation; likewise the yā’ is omitted because it is unvocalised and is followed by a wāw; those who believe they say ‘We believe’; but when they go apart away from them and return to their devils their leaders they say ‘We are with you in religion; we were only mocking them the believers by feigning belief."
  2,15,"God Himself mocks them requiting them for their mockery leaving them that is giving them respite in their insolence that is in their transgressing the limits of unbelief; bewildered wavering in perplexity ya‘mahūn is a circumstantial qualifier."
  2,16,"Those are they who have bought error for guidance that is they have exchanged the latter for the former; so their commerce has not profited them that is to say they have gained nothing from it indeed they have lost because their destination is the Fire made everlasting for them; nor are they guided in what they did."
