tafsir[8]{c,v,t}:
  8,26,"And remember when you were few and oppressed in the land the land of Mecca and were fearful lest men should snatch you away lest the disbelievers should seize you swiftly; how He gave you refuge in Medina and reinforced you strengthened you with His help on the day of Badr with the angels and provided you with the good things the spoils that you might be thankful for His graces."
  8,27,"The following was revealed regarding Abū Lubāba Marwān b. ‘Abd al-Mundhir the Prophet s had dispatched him to the Banū Qurayza so that they would submit to his the Prophet’s authority. But they Banū Qurayza consulted with him as to whether they should cede and he pointed out to them that a slaughter would ensue — for members of his family and his property were among them O you who believe do not betray God and the Messenger and do not betray your trusts that which has been entrusted to you in the way of religion or otherwise while you are aware."
  8,28,"And know that your wealth and your children are a trial for you impeding you from the concerns of the Hereafter; and that with God is a tremendous wage so do not forfeit it by giving undue attention to wealth and children acting treacherously for the sake of preserving them."
  8,29,"The following was revealed regarding his Abū Lubāba’s repentance O you who believe if you fear God by turning in repentance to Him and in other ways He will grant you a means of separation between yourselves and what you fear so that you will be delivered and absolve you of your evil deeds and forgive you your sins; and God is of tremendous bounty."
  8,30,"And remember O Muhammad (s) when the disbelievers — who had gathered to discuss your affair at the council assembly — were plotting against you to confine you to chain you up and imprison you or slay you — all of them acting as assassins of one man — or to expel you from Mecca and they were plotting against you and God was plotting against them by devising a way out for you when He revealed to you what they had devised and commanded you to leave Mecca; and God is the best of those who plot the most knowledgeable among them about it."
  8,31,"And when Our verses namely the Qur’ān were being recited to them they said ‘We have already heard! If we wish we can speak the like of this — al-Nadr b. al-Hārith said this for he used to travel on trading business to al-Hīra where he would buy books containing the tales of the Persians and would recount these to the Meccans; this Qur’ān is nothing but the fables the lies of the ancients’."
  8,32,"And when they said ‘O God! If this that Muhammad (s) recites be indeed the truth revealed from You then rain down stones upon us from the heaven or bring on us a painful chastisement’ in return for our denial of it this was said by al-Nadr and others in mockery and in delusion that he had some insight and certainty about it the Qur’ān being false."
  8,33,"God then says But God was not about to chastise them for what they requested while you were among them for when chastisement is sent down it is all-encompassing and no community was ever chastised except after its prophet and the believers had departed from it; nor was God about to chastise them while they sought forgiveness crying as they performed the circumambulations ‘Your forgiveness! Your forgiveness!’; it is also said that this last clause refers to those oppressed believers among them similar to where God says Had they been clearly separated verily We would have chastised the disbelievers among them with a painful chastisement Q. 4825."
