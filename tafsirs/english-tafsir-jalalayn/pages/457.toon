tafsir[22]{c,v,t}:
  38,62,"And they the disbelievers of Mecca say while they are in the Fire ‘What is the matter with us that we do not see here men whom we used to count in the world among the wicked?"
  38,63,"Did we treat them mockingly? read sukhriyyan or sikhriyyan did we use to deride them in the life of the world the final yā’ in sikhriyyā is attributive. In other words are they missing? Or have our eyes missed them here?’ so that we have not caught sight of them. Such men were the poor among the Muslims like ‘Ammār b. Yāsir Bilāl al-Habashī Suhayb al-Rūmī and Salmān al-Fārisī."
  38,64,"Assuredly that is true such a scene will necessarily take place which is the wrangling of the inhabitants of the Fire — as shown above."
  38,65,"Say O Muhammad (s) to the disbelievers of Mecca ‘I am only a warner to threaten disbelievers with punishment in the Fire. And there is no god except God the One the All-Compelling of all His creatures;"
  38,66,"Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them the Mighty Whose way always prevails the ever Forgiving’ of His friends."
  38,67,"Say to them ‘It is a tremendous tiding"
  38,68,"from which you are turning away namely the Qur’ān of which I have informed you and in which I have brought you what can only be known by revelation and that is God’s saying"
  38,69,"I had no knowledge of the High Council that is to say of the angels when they disputed in the matter of Adam when God exalted be He said to them ‘I am appointing on earth a vicegerent’ to the end of the verse Q. 230."
  38,70,"All that is revealed to me is that I am just a plain warner’ one whose warning is clear."
  38,71,"Mention when your Lord said to the angels ‘Indeed I am about to create a human being out of clay and this was Adam."
  38,72,"So when I have proportioned him completed him and breathed in him when I have caused to flow therein My spirit so that he becomes a living being — the addition of ‘the spirit’ to Adam is an honour for him; the ‘spirit’ is a subtle body that gives life to a human being by permeating him — then fall down in prostration before him!’ — a prostration of salutation that is actually a bow."
  38,73,"Thereat the angels prostrated all of them together there are two emphases here kulluhum and ajma‘ūn;"
  38,74,"except Iblīs the father of the jinn who was among the audience of angels; he was disdainful and he was one of the disbelievers according to God’s knowledge exalted be He."
  38,75,"He said ‘O Iblīs! What prevents you from prostrating before that which I have created with My own hands? in other words whose creation I Myself have undertaken. This in itself is an honour for Adam as God has Himself undertaken the unmediated creation of all creatures. Are you being arrogant now in refraining from prostrating an interrogative meant as a rebuke; or are you of the exalted?’ of the proud and have therefore disdained to prostrate yourself because you are one of them?"
  38,76,"He said ‘I am better than him. You created me from fire and You created him from clay’."
  38,77,"He said ‘Then begone hence that is from Paradise — or it is said begone from the heavens — for you are indeed accursed outcast."
  38,78,"And indeed My curse shall be on you until the Day of Judgement’ the Day of Requital."
  38,79,"He said ‘My Lord then reprieve me until the day when they mankind will be raised’."
  38,80,"He said ‘Then you will indeed be among the reprieved"
  38,81,"until the day of the known time’ the time of the First Blast."
  38,82,"He said ‘Now by Your might I shall surely pervert them all"
  38,83,"except those servants of Yours among them who will be saved’ namely the believers."
