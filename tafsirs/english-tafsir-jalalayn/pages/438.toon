  35,31,"And that which We have revealed to you of the Book the Qur’ān is the truth confirming what was revealed before it in other words confirming the Books that came before it. Indeed with regard to His servants God is truly Aware and Seeing knowing both their inward and outward aspects."
  35,32,"Then We gave the Book the Qur’ān to those of Our servants whom We chose namely your community. Yet some of them are those who wrong themselves by failing to act fully in accordance with it and some of them are moderate acting in accordance with it most of the time and some are those who take the lead in performing good works so that in addition to his acquiring knowledge he disseminates it and shows others the way to proper conduct as well as acting in accordance with the Qur’ān by the leave of God by His will. That bequest to them of the Book is the greatest favour!"
  35,33,"Gardens of Eden as a permanent residence into which they will be admitted the three types of servants mentioned read active yadkhulūnahā ‘they will enter it’ or passive yudkhalūnahā ‘into which they will be admitted’ as the predicate of the subject jannāt ‘gardens’ — therein they will be adorned yuhallawna is a second predicate with some bracelets of gold and pearls studded with gold and their garments therein will be of silk."
  35,34,"And they will say ‘Praise be to God Who has removed all grief from us. Truly our Lord is Forgiving of sins Appreciative of obedience"
  35,35,"Who out of His favour has made us to dwell in the Abode of everlasting Stay wherein no toil shall touch us nor shall we be touched by any fatigue’ lack of strength caused by exhaustion and this is because religious obligations no longer apply therein the second of these ‘fatigue’ which is consequent upon the first ‘toil’ is mentioned in order to make explicit the non-existence of any toil in Paradise."
  35,36,"And as for those who disbelieve there will be for them the fire of Hell they will neither be done away with through death so that they may die and find rest nor will any aspect of its chastisement be lightened for them not even for a single moment. In this way in the way that We requite these We requite every ingrate every disbeliever read yujzā kullu kafūrin ‘every ingrate is so requited’; or najzī kulla kafūrin ‘so We requite every ingrate’."
  35,37,"While therein they will be crying out calling for help in distress howling and saying ‘Our Lord! Bring us forth from it and we will act righteously other than how we used to act’. But it will be said to them ‘Did We not give you long life enough time in which to take heed for him who would take heed? And moreover the warner the Messenger came to you but you did not respond to his call so taste now this chastisement! For the evildoers the disbelievers have no helper’ to ward off from them the chastisement."
  35,38,"Truly God is Knower of the Unseen of the heavens and the earth; truly He knows well what is in the breasts what is in the hearts — thus there is all the more reason that He should also have knowledge of other things given the way people are."
