tafsir[13]{c,v,t}:
  27,64,"Or He Who originates creation in the wombs from a sperm-drop then brings it back again after death as established by the proofs for this resurrection even if you do not acknowledge it; and Who provides for you from the heaven rain and from the earth vegetation. Is there a god with God? In other words none of the things mentioned is done by anyone other than God and there is no god with Him. Say O Muhammad (s) ‘Produce your proof your definitive argument if you are truthful’ about their being a god with Me who has done any of the things mentioned."
  27,65,"They the disbelievers also asked him when the Hour will come to pass and the following was revealed Say ‘No one in the heavens or the earth knows be it angels or human beings the Unseen namely what is hidden from them except God He knows it and they are not aware the disbelievers of Mecca like others when is the time in which they will be resurrected."
  27,66,"Nay has their knowledge come to comprise read adraka similar to the 4th verbal form akrama ‘he was kind to’; a variant reading has iddāraka which is actually tadāraka with the tā’ changed into a dāl and assimilated with the other dāl and a conjunctive hamza added meaning ‘attained’ or ‘caught up with’ the Hereafter? such that they have reason to ask about the time of its coming — not so Nay for they are in doubt of it. Rather they are blind to it ‘amūna ‘blind’ as in blindness of the heart; this statement is rhetorically more powerful than the preceding one; the origin of the term is ‘amiyūn but the damma vowel is deemed too heavy for the yā’ and has been moved to the mīm after dropping its kasra vowel."
  27,67,"And the disbelievers say also in rejecting the idea of resurrection ‘What! When we and our fathers are dust shall we indeed be brought forth again? from the graves."
  27,68,"Already we and our fathers have been promised this before. But these are just the legendary fables of the ancients’ asātīr is the plural of ustūra meaning ‘what has been written down mā sutira of lies’."
  27,69,"Say ‘Travel in the land and see how was the sequel for the criminals’ because of their denials — and this sequel is that they were destroyed with punishment."
  27,70,"And do not grieve for them and do not be distressed by their schemes — this is meant to comfort the Prophet s in other words do not be concerned with their plotting against you for We will grant you victory over them."
  27,71,"And they say ‘When will this promise of chastisement be if you are truthful?’ regarding it."
  27,72,"Say ‘It may be that part of what you seek to hasten on is close behind you’ — so they were slain at Badr and the remaining chastisement will come to them after death."
  27,73,"And surely your Lord is bountiful to mankind an example of which is His deferring chastisement for the disbelievers but most of them are not thankful — disbelievers are not grateful for the deferring of chastisement since they reject the fact that it will ever come to pass."
  27,74,"And surely your Lord knows what their hearts conceal what these hide and what they proclaim by their tongues."
  27,75,"And there is not a thing hidden in the heaven and the earth the hā’ tā’ marbūta of ghā’ibatun is hyperbole in other words anything that is completely hidden from people but it is in a manifest Book namely in the Preserved Tablet al-lawh al-mahfūz and in God’s concealed knowledge an example of which is the time of the chastising of the disbelievers."
  27,76,"Truly this Qur’ān recounts to the Children of Israel — those living at the time of our Prophet — the means to resolve most of that concerning which they differ that is by virtue of the fact that it expounds the said differences as they should be eliminating any disagreements between them if only they were to implement it and submit to its prescriptions."
