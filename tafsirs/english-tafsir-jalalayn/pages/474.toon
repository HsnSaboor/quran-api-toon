  40,59,"Truly the Hour is coming; there is no doubt in it. But most people do not believe in it."
  40,60,"And your Lord has said ‘Call on Me and I will respond to you in other words worship Me and I will reward you — judging this to be the meaning by what follows. Surely those who disdain to worship Me shall enter sa-yadkhulūna or passive sa-yudkhalūna ‘they shall be admitted into’ Hell utterly humiliated’ abased."
  40,61,"God it is Who made for you night that you may rest in it and day for seeing — the attribution of sight ibsār to ‘day’ is figurative and it is so attributed because one is able to see in it. Surely God is a Lord of bounty to mankind but most people are not thankful to God and so they do not believe."
  40,62,"That then is God your Lord the Creator of all things; there is no god except Him. How then are you made to deviate? how then are you turned away from faith despite the evidence having been established for it?"
  40,63,"So deviate that is in the same way that these Meccans deviate deviate those who used to deny the signs of God His miracles."
  40,64,"God it is Who made for you the earth as a stable abode and the heaven as a canopy a ceiling. And He formed you and perfected your forms and provided you with all the wholesome things. That then is God your Lord so blessed be God the Lord of the Worlds."
  40,65,"He is the Living; there is no god except Him. So supplicate Him worship Him devoting your religion purely to Him free from any idolatry. Praise be to God the Lord of the Worlds."
  40,66,"Say ‘I have been forbidden to worship those on whom you call those whom you worship besides God since there have come to me clear signs proofs of His Oneness from my Lord; and I have been commanded to submit to the Lord of the Worlds’."
