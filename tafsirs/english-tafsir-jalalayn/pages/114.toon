tafsir[5]{c,v,t}:
  5,37,"They will desire they will wish to exit from the Fire but they will not exit from it; theirs shall be a lasting a perpetual chastisement."
  5,38,"And the thieving male and the thieving female the definite article in both nouns relates to the subject sc. wa’lladhī saraqa wa’llatī saraqat ‘And the male who thieves and the female who thieves’; because this clause resembles a conditional statement sc. ‘if he thieves if she thieves’ etc. the fā’ has been included in the predicate fa’qta‘ū ‘then cut off’ cut off their hands that is the right hand of each of the two from the wristbone; it is explained in the Sunna that the amputation applies to the stealing of a quarter of a dinar and upwards and if the person were to re-offend the left foot should then be amputated from the ankle and then on subsequent re-offending the left hand is amputated followed by the right foot after which discretionary punishment is applied; as a requital jazā’an is in the accusative because it is a verbal noun for what they have earned and an exemplary punishment for both of them from God; God is Mighty His way will prevail Wise in His creation."
  5,39,"But whoever repents after his evildoing refrains from theft and amends his actions God will relent to him. God is indeed Forgiving Merciful in expressing what has been stated. However the rights of the victim to have the penalty of amputation carried out and his property restored are not automatically forgone after repentance. In fact as is clarified in the Sunna only if he is pardoned before being taken to the Imam is the punishment of amputation waived and al-Shāfi‘ī is of this opinion."
  5,40,"Do you not know the interrogative here is meant as an affirmative that to God belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth? He chastises him for whom He wills chastisement for and forgives him for whom He wills forgiveness and God has power over all things including chastising and forgiving."
  5,41,"O Messenger let them not grieve you the actions of those who vie with one another in disbelief falling headlong into it in other words they who manifest it at every opportunity of min here is explicative such as say with their mouths with their tongues bi-alsinatihim is semantically connected to qālū ‘such as say’ ‘We believe’ but their hearts do not believe and these are the hypocrites; and from among those of Jewry there is a folk who listen to calumny fabricated by their rabbis listening acceptingly listening to you on behalf of some other folk from among the Jews who have not come to you these were the inhabitants of Khaybar among whom two married persons committed adultery but whom they did not want to stone. And so they dispatched men from Qurayza to ask the Prophet s about the ruling concerning the two; perverting words that are in the Torah such as the ‘stoning’ verse from their contexts the contexts in which God had placed them that is to say substituting them saying to the ones they dispatched ‘If you are given this distorted ruling that is flogging which Muhammad (s) has pronounced for you as a ruling then take it accept it; but if you are not given it and he pronounces some other ruling for you then beware!’ of accepting it! Whomever God desires to try to lead astray you cannot avail him anything against God by preventing such a trial. Those are they whose hearts God did not desire to purify of unbelief for had He desired it you would have been able to do something for them; theirs shall be degradation in this world humiliation by being disgraced and subjected to the jizya and in the Hereafter theirs shall be a great chastisement."
