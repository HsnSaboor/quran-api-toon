tafsir[5]{c,v,t}:
  13,1,"Alif lām mīm rā’ God knows best what He means by these letters. Those these verses are the verses of the Book the Qur’ān the genitive annexation carries the meaning of partitive min ‘from’ and that which has been revealed to you from your Lord namely the Qur’ān this preceding sentence constitutes the subject the predicate of which is the following is the Truth wherein is no doubt but most people that is the people of Mecca do not believe that it is from God exalted be He."
  13,2,"God is He Who raised up the heavens without visible supports ‘amad is the plural of ‘imād which is the same as an ustuwāna ‘a column’; and this statement is true since there are no actual supports then presided upon the Throne a presiding befitting Him and disposed made subservient the sun and the moon each one of them moving along its course until the conclusion of an appointed time that is until the Day of Resurrection. He directs the command He conducts the affairs of His Kingdom. He details He expounds the signs the indications of His power so that you O people of Mecca might be certain of the encounter with your Lord through resurrection."
  13,3,"And He it is Who spread out extended flat the earth and set created therein firm mountains and rivers and of every fruit He has made in it two kinds of every species. He covers He cloaks the night and its darkness with the day. Surely in that which is mentioned are signs indications of His Oneness exalted be He for a people who reflect upon God’s handiwork."
  13,4,"And on the earth are tracts diverse terrains neighbouring each other joined side by side some good some briny some of little yield and some fruitful — and these constitute proofs of His power exalted be He — and gardens orchards of vines and sown fields read zar‘un in the nominative as a supplement to jannātun ‘gardens’ or read zar‘in in the genitive as a supplement to a‘nābin ‘of vines’; similarly constituting proofs of His power are His words and date-palms sharing one root sinwān is the plural of sinw which are date-palms belonging to the same root but with many offshoots and date-palms otherwise each of individual root watered read tusqā as referring to jannāt ‘gardens’ and what is in them or read yusqā as referring to the mentioned date-palms by the same source of water; and We make some of them to excel wa-nufaddil or read wa-yufaddil ‘and He God makes some of them to excel’ others in flavour read fī’l-ukul or fī’l-ukl and so some are sweet others bitter — and these are also proofs of His power exalted be He. Surely in that which is mentioned are signs for a people who understand who reflect."
  13,5,"And if you wonder O Muhammad (s) at the disbelievers denying you then surely wondrous surely deserving wonder is their saying in denial of resurrection ‘When we have become dust shall we indeed then be raised in a new creation?’ it is wondrous because the One Who has the power to originate creation and to originate what has been mentioned above without any precedent has also the power to restore them to life both hamzas in both instances a-idhā and a-innā are pronounced; or one may pronounce the first and not pronounce the second but in both cases inserting an alif or not inserting it; one variant reading has the first a-idhā as the interrogative and the second one a-innā as the predicate while another variant reading has the exact opposite. Those are the ones who disbelieve in their Lord; those — fetters shall be around their necks; and those they shall be the inhabitants of the Fire abiding therein."
