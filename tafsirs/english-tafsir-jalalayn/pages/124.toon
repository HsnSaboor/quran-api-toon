  5,96,"Permitted to you O people be you in pilgrimage inviolability or not is the game of the sea for consumption and it is what can only live in the sea such as fish but not what is able to live both in the sea and on land such as crabs; and food from it what it casts out that is dead is a provision for you for you to consume and for the wayfarers the travellers among you to take as their provisions; but forbidden to you is the hunting of game on the land and this consists of those edible beasts that live on it; do not hunt them so long as you remain in pilgrimage inviolability if it is caught by one not in pilgrimage inviolability then it is permissible for a person in pilgrimage inviolability to consume it as is clarified in the Sunna; and fear God to whom you shall be gathered."
  5,97,"God has appointed the Ka‘ba the Sacred inviolable House as an enduring institution for mankind an institution by which their religious affair is sustained through pilgrimage to it as is their this-worldly affair on account of the security guaranteed for those who enter it and the fact that they are not interfered with and because all manner of fruits are brought to it a variant reading for qiyāman has qiyaman ‘always standing’ as the verbal noun from 1st form qāma ‘to remain standing’ without defectiveness of the middle radical; and the sacred month meaning the sacred months of Dhū’l-Qa‘da Dhū’l-Hijja Muharram and Rajab instituted for them to be secure from fighting during them; the offering and the garlands instituted for their owner so that he does not suffer any interference; that mentioned appointment is so that you may know that God knows all that is in the heavens and in the earth and that God has knowledge of all things thus that appointing of His in order to secure benefits for you and to ward off harm from you before such things came to pass testifies to His knowledge of all that is in existence and all that will be."
  5,98,"Know that God is severe in punishment of His enemies and that God is Forgiving to His friends Merciful to them."
  5,99,"The duty of the Messenger is only to convey the Message to you; and God knows what you reveal what deeds you manifest and what you hide and what of these you conceal and He will requite you for it."
  5,100,"Say ‘The evil the unlawful and the good the lawful are not equal even though the abundance of the evil attract you.’ So fear God in avoiding it O people of pith so that you might prosper triumph."
  5,101,"The following was revealed when they began to ask the Prophet s too many questions O you who believe do not ask about things which if disclosed to you if revealed would trouble you because of the hardship that would ensue from them; yet if you ask about them while the Qur’ān is being revealed during the time of the Prophet s they will be disclosed to you meaning that if you ask about certain things during his lifetime the Qur’ān will reveal them but once these things are disclosed it will grieve you. So do not ask about them; indeed God has pardoned those things you asked about so do not ask again; for God is Forgiving Forbearing."
  5,102,"Verily a people before you asked about them that is they asked their prophets about such things and they received the response in the form of revealed explications of the rules concerning them; and then they disbelieved in them by neglecting to implement them."
  5,103,"God has not ordained He has not stipulated in His Law anything such as a Bahīra a Sā’iba a Wasīla or a Hām in the way that people did at the time of paganism. Al-Bukhārī reported in a hadīth from Sa‘īd b. al-Musayyab who said ‘The bahīra is that camel whose milk is consecrated to idols and whom no human may milk; the sā’iba is the one they would leave to roam freely for their gods and was forbidden to bear any load; the wasīla is the young she-camel that would give birth to a young female as its first offspring followed by another female bearing one after the other without a male in between she would then be left to roam freely for their idols; the hām is the mature male camel which after completing a certain number of copulations with a female would then be consigned to their idols and be exempt from bearing any load and they would call it hāmī; but the disbelievers invent lies against God in this matter by attributing the sanctioning of such practices to Him; and most of them do not understand that this is mendacity for in this they have merely followed the example of their forefathers."
