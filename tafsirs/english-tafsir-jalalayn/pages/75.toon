tafsir[8]{c,v,t}:
  3,187,"And mention when God made covenant with those who had been given the Scripture that is the pledge taken from them in the Torah ‘You shall expound it read tubayyinunnahu or yubayyinunnahu ‘they shall expound it’ the Book to people and not conceal it’ read taktumūnahu ‘you shall not conceal it’ or yaktumūnahu ‘they shall not conceal it’. But they rejected it they discarded the covenant behind their backs and so they did not act in accordance with it and bought with it they took in its place a small price of this world from the debased among them enjoying supremacy over them in knowledge and they concealed it lest it the supremacy escape them; how evil is what they have bought how evil is this purchase of theirs!"
  3,188,"Do not reckon that lā tahsabanna or read lā yahsabanna ‘let them not reckon’ those who rejoice in what they have brought that is in what they have done by leading people astray and who love to be praised for what they have not done in the way of adherence to the truth being themselves misguided — do not reckon them fa-lā tahsabannahum is for emphasis in the case of both readings above secure in a place where they can escape from the chastisement in the Hereafter; but instead they shall be in a place of wherein they shall be tortured and that is Hell; there shall be a painful chastisement for them in it alīm means mu’lim ‘painful’. If one reads yahsabanna ‘let them not reckon’ the two direct objects of the first h-s-b verb would be indicated by the two direct objects of the second h-s-b verb; but if one reads tahsabanna ‘do not reckon’ then only second direct object would be omitted."
  3,189,"To God belongs the kingdom of the heavens and of the earth the storehouses of rain sustenance vegetation and so forth and God has power over all things including the punishing of disbelievers and the saving of believers."
  3,190,"Surely in the creation of the heavens and the earth and the marvels contained in them and in the alternation of night and day coming and going increasing and diminishing there are signs indications of God’s power for people of pith for people possessing intellects."
  3,191,"Those who alladhīna an adjectival qualification of the preceding li-ūlī l-albāb ‘for people of pith’ or a substitution for it remember God standing and sitting and on their sides reclining that is to say in all states it is reported from Ibn ‘Abbās that they perform prayer in these ways each according to his own capacity; and reflect upon the creation of the heavens and the earth to deduce therefrom the power of their Creator saying ‘Our Lord You have not created this creation that we see in vain bātilan a circumstantial qualifier frivolously but as a proof of the totality of Your power. Glory be to You! exalted above any frivolity. So guard us against the chastisement of the Fire."
  3,192,"Our Lord whomever You admit into the Fire to abide therein You will have abased You will have humiliated and the evildoers the disbelievers therein shall have no helpers to protect them from God’s chastisement exalted be He the overt noun ‘the evildoers’ has replaced the pronominalisation ‘whomever’ in order to inform that the punishment of abasement is specifically theirs; the min of min ansār ‘helpers’ is extra."
  3,193,"Our Lord we have heard a caller calling summoning people to belief li’l-īmān means ilā l-īmān and this is Muhammad (s) or summoning them to the Qur’ān saying that “Believe in your Lord!” And we believed in Him. So our Lord forgive us our sins and absolve us of conceal our evil deeds and so do not make them manifest by punishing us for them and take us in death receive our spirits together with the pious the prophets and the righteous."
  3,194,"Our Lord grant us what You have promised us through the tongues of Your messengers in the way of mercy and favour they are asking Him that they be made among those that deserve such a promise for God’s promise is fufilled regardless but they are not certain that they are among those who deserve it. The repetition of the phrase our Lord is out of extreme humility; and abase us not on the Day of Resurrection. You will not fail the tryst’ the promise of Resurrection and Requital."
