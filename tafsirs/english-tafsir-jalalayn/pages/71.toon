tafsir[8]{c,v,t}:
  3,158,"And if wa-la-in the lām is for oaths you die read in both ways muttum or mittum or are slain in the holy struggle or otherwise it is to God and to none other than Him that you shall be mustered in the Hereafter and He will requite you."
  3,159,"It was by the mercy of God that you O Muhammad (s) were lenient with them that is that you showed indulgence toward them when they disobeyed you; had you been harsh ill-natured and fierce of heart brutish and coarse towards them they would have dispersed split away from about you. So pardon them pass over what they have done and ask forgiveness for them for their sins until I forgive them and consult them find out their opinions in the matter that is your affair in the battle and otherwise in order to win their hearts over and so that you may be emulated in this respect; and indeed the Prophet s would frequently consult them. And when you are resolved to carry out what you wish after counsel rely on God put your trust in Him and not in any counsel; for God loves those who rely on Him."
  3,160,"If God helps you if He gives you assistance against your enemy as on the Day of Badr then none can overcome you; but if He forsakes you if He refrains from assisting you as on the Day of Uhud then who is there who can help you after Him? that is after His forsaking you? In other words there is no one to help you. Therefore on God and on no one else let the believers rely."
  3,161,"When some red velvet cloth went missing on the Day of Badr and some people began to say ‘Perhaps the Prophet took it’ the following was revealed It is not for a prophet to be fraudulent an yaghulla a variant reading has the passive an yughalla meaning to attribute ghulūl ‘fraud’ to him to be treacherous with regard to the spoils so do not presume this of him; whoever defrauds shall bring what he has defrauded on the Day of Resurrection carrying it around his neck; then every soul the fraudulent and the otherwise shall be paid in full the requital of what it has earned what it has done and they shall not be wronged a single thing."
  3,162,"Is he who follows God’s beatitude being obedient and not defrauding like him who is laden one who returns with God’s anger because of his disobedience and fraud whose abode is Hell? An evil journey’s end a resort it is!"
  3,163,"No! They are of degrees that is individuals of different degrees before God that is belonging to varying stations for those that follow His beatitude a reward and for those that are laden with God’s anger punishment; and God sees what they do and will requite them for it."
  3,164,"Truly God was gracious to the believers when He sent to them a messenger from among their own that is to say an Arab like them not an angel or a non-Arab so that they can understand what he says and feel honoured thereby to recite to them His verses the Qur’ān and to purify them to cleanse them of sins and to teach them the Book the Qur’ān wisdom the Sunna though in is softened in place of inna that is innahum ‘though they…’ before that is before he was sent they were in clear error."
  3,165,"And why when distress befell you at Uhud when seventy of you were slain and you had afflicted twice the like of it at Badr slaying seventy of them and taking another seventy captive did you say in amazement ‘How is this?’ that is how did this defeat happen to us when we are Muslims and God’s Messenger is among us the last statement annā hādhā ‘how is this?’ constitutes the locus of the interrogative of denial. Say to them ‘It is from yourselves because you abandoned your battle stations and were thus defeated. Surely God has power over everything’ including the giving of assistance and the withholding of it and He requited you for your disputing the Prophet’s command."
