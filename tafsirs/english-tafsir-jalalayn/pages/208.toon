  10,1,"Alif lām rā’ God knows best what He means by these letters. Those namely these signs are the signs of the wise Book that is the Qur’ān the genitive annexation āyāt al-kitāb has the meaning of min sc. min āyāti’l-kitāb ‘from among the verses of the Book’ which has been made clear."
  10,2,"Is it for the people the people of Mecca this interrogative is meant as a disavowal; the preposition li- ‘for’ and its dependent genitive noun al-nās ‘the people’ constitute a circumstantial qualifier of His saying a wonder ‘ajaban read in the accusative as a predicate of kāna; or if read in the nominative ‘ajabun as its subject its predicate which is also its subject if read according to the former accusative reading is the following an awhaynā that We have inspired a man from among them Muhammad (s) saying an ‘that’ is explicative ‘Warn threaten the people the disbelievers with chastisement and give good tidings to those who believe that they have a prior a preceding promise of truth with their Lord’? that is a preceding fair reward in return for the deeds they have sent forward. The disbelievers say ‘Truly this Qur’ān that comprises all of that mentioned is manifest sorcery’ a variant reading for la-sihrun has la-sāhirun ‘a sorcerer’ where it is the Prophet s to whom they are referring as being ‘a manifest sorcerer’."
  10,3,"Truly your Lord is God Who created the heavens and the earth in six days of the days of this world that is in the same measure of time since there was no sun or moon then had He willed He could have created them in an instant but the reason for His not having done so is that He wanted to teach His creatures to be circumspect; then He presided upon the Throne a presiding befitting of Him directing affairs among creatures. There is no mā min indicates a relative clause intercessor to intercede for anyone save after His permission a refutation of their saying ‘The idols intercede for us!’; that Creator and Director is God your Lord so worship Him affirm His Oneness.

  10,4,"To Him exalted be He is the return of all of you God’s promise in truth both wa‘da and haqqan are verbal nouns and in the accusative because of the verbs implicit in them. Truly He read innahu as a new sentence or annahu with an implied lām sc. li-annahu ‘Because He’ originates creation that is He began it by originating it then recreates it through resurrection that He may requite reward those who believe and perform righteous deeds justly. And those who disbelieve for them will be a draught of boiling water and a painful chastisement because they disbelieved."
  10,5,"He it is Who made the sun a radiance that is emitting light and the moon a light and determined it with respect to its movement in stations 28 stations in 28 nights every month becoming concealed for two nights when a particular month has 30 days or concealed for one night when it has 29 days so that you might know thereby the number of the years and the reckoning. God did not create that which is mentioned save in truth not in vain exalted be He above such things. He details read yufassilu or nufassilu ‘We detail’ the signs for a people who know who reflect."
  10,6,"Truly in the alternation of night and day in their coming and going increasing and diminishing and in what God has created in the heavens of angels sun moon stars and other things and in the earth of animals mountains seas rivers trees and other things there are signs indications of His power exalted be He for a people who fear Him and so believe He singles these out for mention because they are the ones to benefit from them such signs."
