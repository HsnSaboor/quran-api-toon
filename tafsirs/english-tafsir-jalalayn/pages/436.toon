tafsir[7]{c,v,t}:
  35,12,"Nor are the two kinds of seas alike this one is extremely sweet pleasant to drink and that one is salty extremely bitter. Yet from each of the two you eat fresh meat namely fish and obtain from the salt — and it is also said from both of them — ornaments which you wear namely pearls and coral. And you see you sight the ships therein in each of the two seas ploughing through mawākhira in other words tamkhuru’l-mā’a meaning ‘it cleaves it as it makes its way through it coming and going by the same wind that you may seek of His bounty exalted be He through commerce and that perhaps you may give thanks to God for this bounty."
  35,13,"He God makes the night pass enter into the day so that it becomes longer and He makes the day pass into the night so that it becomes longer and He has disposed the sun and the moon each of them moving in its course to an appointed term — to the Day of Resurrection. That is God your Lord; to Him belongs all sovereignty. As for those on whom you call whom you worship besides Him in other words other than Him — and they are the idols — they do not possess even so much as the husk of a date-stone."
  35,14,"If you call on them they will not hear your call and even if they heard —hypothetically speaking — they would not be able to respond to you; and on the Day of Resurrection they will disown your idolatrous associations in other words your associating them with God in power that is to say they will declare themselves innocent of you and of your worship of them. And none can inform you about the state in the two abodes like One Who is Aware Knower and this is God exalted be He."
  35,15,"O mankind! You are the ones who are in need of God in every state. And God He is the Independent without any need of His creatures the Praised the One Who is praised in whatever He does with them."
  35,16,"If He will He can take you away and bring about a new creation instead of you."
  35,17,"And that is not an arduous thing for God."
  35,18,"And no burdened soul shall bear the burden of another sinful soul. And should one soul burdened heavily with sin call for some of its burden to be borne by another nothing of it will be borne even if the one called be a relative kin such as a father or a son — the impossibility of ‘having something borne by another’ in both instances is something ordained by God. You can only warn those who fear their Lord in secret in other words those who fear Him despite not having seen Him for they are the ones to benefit from the warning and observe the prayer maintain performance of it. For whoever purifies himself cleansing himself of idolatry and other similar abominations is purifying himself only for the sake of his own soul because the reforming of his self pertains to him. And to God is the end of the journeying the return in the Hereafter when He will requite according to deeds."
