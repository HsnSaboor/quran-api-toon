tafsir[8]{c,v,t}:
  41,47,"To Him devolves all knowledge of the Hour — when it shall come to pass none other than Him knows this. And no fruit thamaratin a variant reading has the plural thamarātin ‘fruits’ emerges from its sheath its receptacle akmām the plural of kimm except with His knowledge and no female bears child or delivers except with His knowledge. And on the day when He will call out to them ‘Where then are My associates?’ they will say ‘We proclaim to You we now apprise You that there is no witness amongst us’ that is a witness who can testify to the allegation that You have an associate."
  41,48,"And what they used to call on what they used to worship before in this world of idols has forsaken them and they suppose they will be certain that there is no refuge for them no escape from the chastisement the negation in both instances comments on the operation implied in the nouns of actions; also the negation stands in place of the direct objects in both instances."
  41,49,"Man never wearies of supplicating for good in other words he never ceases to ask his Lord for wealth and good health and other good things but should any ill befall him such as impoverishment or hardship then he becomes despondent despairing of God’s mercy — this and what follows relates to the attitude of disbelievers."
  41,50,"And if wa-la-in the lām is for oaths We let him taste if We bestow on him mercy such as riches or good health from Us after the harm the hardship or tribulation that had befallen him he will surely say ‘This is my due! in other words it is on account of what I do. I do not think that the Hour will ever set in and even if wa-la-in the lām is for oaths I am returned to my Lord I will indeed have the best reward with Him’ namely Paradise. But We will assuredly inform those who disbelieve of what they did and assuredly We will make them taste a harsh chastisement the lām prefixed in both verbs is that for oaths."
  41,51,"And when We bestow graces upon man insān the generic noun is meant he shows disregard of giving thanks and turns aside turns his head in arrogance a variant reading for nā’a has na’ā; but when ill befalls him he makes prolonged supplications."
  41,52,"Say ‘Consider this if it the Qur’ān is from God as the Prophet says and you disbelieve in it who — in other words none — will be further astray than one who is in extreme defiance?’ of the truth this third person singular address is used instead of ‘who will be further astray than you’ in order to point out their status as disbelievers."
  41,53,"We shall show them Our signs in the horizons in all the regions of the heavens and the earth in the way of the luminous celestial bodies the varieties of vegetation and trees and in their own souls in the way of the exquisite craftsmanship and unique wisdom inherent in their creation until it becomes clear to them that it namely the Qur’ān is the truth revealed by God informing of the Resurrection the Reckoning and the Punishment so that they realise that they will be punished for their disbelief in it and in the one who has come with it. Is it not sufficient that your Lord bi-rabbika governs the verb yakfi ‘sufficient’ is witness to all things? annahu ‘alā kulli shay’in shahīd substitutes for bi-rabbika. In other words is not sufficient proof of your truthfulness that nothing whatsoever can be hidden from God?"
  41,54,"Nay verily they are in doubt about the encounter with their Lord because they deny the Resurrection. Nay verily He exalted be He encompasses all things in knowledge and in power and so He will requite them for their disbelief."
