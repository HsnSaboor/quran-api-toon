  61,6,"And mention when Jesus son of Mary said ‘O Children of Israel — he did not say ‘O my people’ as did Moses because he was not related to them in any way — I am indeed God’s messenger to you confirming what is before me of the Torah and bringing good tidings of a messenger who will come after me whose name is Ahmad.’ God exalted be He says Yet when he brought them when Ahmad brought the disbelievers the clear signs the revelations and the indications they said ‘This namely what has been brought is manifest sorcery!’ sihrun a variant reading has sāhirun ‘a sorcerer’ meaning the one who has brought them is a manifest sorcerer."
  61,7,"And who does — that is to say none does — greater wrong than he who invents lies against God by ascribing a partner and a child to Him and describing His signs as being sorcery when he is actually being summoned to submission to God? And God does not guide the wrongdoing folk the disbelieving folk."
  61,8,"They desire to extinguish li-yutfi’ū is in the subjunctive form because of an implicit an sc. an yutfi’ū the lām being extra the light of God His Law and His proofs with their mouths with their sayings that this is sorcery or poetry or soothsaying; but God will perfect He will manifest His light mutimmun nūrahu some have read this in the form of a genitive annextation mutimmu nūrihi though the disbelievers be averse to this."
  61,9,"It is He Who has sent His Messenger with the guidance and the religion of truth that He may make it prevail that He may raise it over all other religions over all the religions which oppose it though the disbelievers be averse to this."
  61,10,"O you who believe shall I show you a commerce that will deliver you read tunjīkum or tunajjīkum from a painful chastisement? It is as if they had replied ‘Yes’ so that He then says"
  61,11,"You should believe you should maintain faith in God and His Messenger and struggle for the cause of God with your possessions and your lives. That is better for you should you know that it is better for you then do it."
  61,12,"He will then forgive you yaghfir is the response to an implied conditional that is to say ‘if you do this He will then forgive you’ your sins and admit you into gardens underneath which rivers flow and pleasant dwellings in the Gardens of Eden as a residence. That is the supreme triumph."
  61,13,"And He will give you another grace which you love help from God and a victory near at hand. And give good tidings to the believers of assistance and victory."
  61,14,"O you who believe be helpers of God of His religion a variant reading of ansāran li’Llāhi has the genitive annexation ansāra’Llāhi just as said kamā qāla to the end of the statement means ‘just as the disciples were so’ as is indicated by what follows Jesus son of Mary to the disciples ‘Who will be my helpers unto God?’ that is to say who of you will be helpers alongside me turning to help God? The disciples said ‘We will be God’s helpers!’ These al-hawāriyyūn were the intimates of Jesus for they were the first to believe in him. They were twelve men of pure white complexion hawar; but it is also said that their epithet derives from the fact that they were bleachers qassārūn who bleached yuhawwirūna clothes. So a group of the Children of Israel believed in Jesus saying ‘He is indeed the servant of God who has been raised to heaven’ while a group disbelieved because they said that he was the son of God whom He had raised unto Himself. Thus the two groups waged war against one another. Then We strengthened those who believed of the two groups against their enemy the disbelieving groups and so they became the triumphant the victors."
