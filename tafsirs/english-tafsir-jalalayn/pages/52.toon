tafsir[7]{c,v,t}:
  3,16,"Those alladhīna is either an adjectival qualification of or a substitution for the previous alladhīna who say “O Our Lord we believe in You and in Your Prophet; so forgive us our sins and guard us from the chastisement of the Fire”."
  3,17,"The patient in obedience and against disobedience al-sābirīna ‘the patient’ is an adjectival qualification of alladhīna ‘those’ truthful in their faith obedient compliant before God expenders of charity imploring God’s pardon by saying ‘Lord forgive us’ at daybreak’ in the last part of the night singled out here for mention because it is the time of unawareness and of the joy of sleep."
  3,18,"God bears witness that is to say He has made it clear to His creation through proofs and signs that there is no god none that is truly worshipped in existence except Him He has borne witness to this and the angels have also borne witness to this by affirming it and those of knowledge from among the prophets and the believers through their conviction and in words; upholding constantly and uniquely maintaining His creations with justice qā’iman ‘upholding’ is in the accusative because it is a circumstantial qualifier and is governed by the import of the statement implied to be something like tafarrada ‘He alone is upholding…’; there is no god except Him He has repeated it for emphasis; the Mighty in His Kingdom the Wise in His actions."
  3,19,"Lo! the religion with God pleasing to Him is submission to the One God al-islām that is to say the Divine Law with which the messengers were sent founded upon the affirmation of God’s Oneness a variant reading for inna ‘lo!’ has anna ‘that’ as an inclusive substitution for annahu to the end of that verse sc. shahida Llāhu … anna l-dīna ‘inda Llāhi l-islām ‘God bears witness that religion with God is Islām. Those who were given the Scripture the Jews and the Christians differed in religion some affirming God’s Oneness others rejecting it only after the knowledge of Oneness came to them through transgression on the part of the disbelievers among themselves. And whoever disbelieves in God’s signs God is swift at reckoning that is at requiting him."
  3,20,"So if they the disbelievers dispute with you O Muhammad (s) concerning religion say to them ‘I have surrendered my countenance to God that is to say I have submitted to Him I and whoever follows me’ wajh ‘countenance’ is chosen here because of its noble character for the other parts of the body will just as soon surrender once the countenance has; and say to those who have been given the Scripture the Jews and the Christians and to the uninstructed the Arab idolaters ‘Have you submitted?’ that is to say ‘Submit!’ And so if they have submitted they have been guided from error but if they turn their backs to Islam your duty is only to deliver the Message; and God sees His servants and so requites them for their deeds — this statement was revealed before the command to fight them had been revealed."
  3,21,"Those who disbelieve in the signs of God and slay yaqtulūna is also read as yuqātilūna ‘they fight against’ the prophets without right and slay those who enjoin to equity to justice and these are the Jews who are reported to have killed forty–three prophets and to have been forbidden this by a hundred and seventy devout worshippers among them each of whom was killed immediately. So give them good tidings let them know of a painful chastisement. The use of ‘good tidings’ here is meant as a sarcastic ridicule of them the fā’ of fa-bashshirhum so give them good tidings is considered part of the predicate of inna because its noun that is its relative clause resembles a conditional sc. in yakfurūna ‘if they disbelieve…’ fa-bashshirhum ‘then give them good tidings…’."
  3,22,"Those are the ones whose works what good they did in the way of charity and kindness to kin have failed whose works are invalid in this world and the Hereafter and so they have nothing to reckon with since these works are of no consequence; they have no helpers no protectors from the chastisement."
