tafsir[5]{c,v,t}:
  2,265,"But the likeness of the expenditure of those who expend their wealth seeking God’s good pleasure and to confirm themselves that is to realise the reward thereof in contrast to the hypocrites who do not hope for it since they do not believe in it is as the likeness of a garden an orchard upon a hill read rabwa or rubwa a high ground; a torrent smites it and it yields gives forth its produce read ukulahā or uklahā its fruits twofold twice the fruits of another garden; if no torrent smites it then dew tall a light drizzle which falls on it and suffices it on account of its altitude. In other words it grows and bears fruit regardless of how much rain falls; likewise are the expenditures of those mentioned they will increase with God regardless of how much they were; and God sees what you do and He will requite you for it."
  2,266,"Would any of you wish to have a garden an orchard of date-palms and vines with rivers flowing beneath it for him there is in it all manner of fruit then old age smites him and makes him too weak to profit from it and he has seed but they are weak young children who cannot manage it; then a whirlwind i‘sār are violent winds with fire smites it and it is consumed? so that he loses what he is most in need of and now he and his children have become incapacitated confused without any resources. This is a similitude of how the expenditure of the one expending for show or the one who reproaches after having expended vanishes and how it is of no avail when he will be most in need of it in the Hereafter the interrogative a-yawaddu ‘would any wish’ is intended as a denial. According to Ibn ‘Abbās this is the person who performs deeds of obedience but when Satan comes to him he begins to work disobedience until all his good deeds have been consumed. So in the way that He has explained what has been mentioned God makes clear the signs to you so that you might reflect and take heed."
  2,267,"O you who believe expend of that is to say purify the good things you have earned of property and the good things of what We have produced for you from the earth of grains and fruits and seek not lā tayammamū means lā taqsudū the corrupt the vile of it the above-mentioned for your expending it as alms tunfiqūna ‘you expend’ is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the person of the verb tayammamū ‘seek’; for you would never take it the vile part yourselves if you were given it as something due to you; without closing your eyes to it by being careless and mindless so how do you expect to give what is due to God from this?; and know that God is Independent of your expenditures Laudable praised in every situation."
  2,268,"Satan promises you poverty by making you fear loss when you make a voluntary almsgiving and so you withhold it and enjoins you to indecency niggardliness and the impeding of almsgiving; but God promises you in return for your expenditure His pardon for your sins and His bounty as sustenance from Him; and God is Embracing in His bounty Knowing the one who expends."
  2,269,"He gives wisdom that is the profitable knowledge that leads to righteous action to whomever He will and he who is given wisdom has been given much good because he will end up in perpetual bliss; yet none remembers the tā’ of yadhdhakkar has been assimilated with the dhāl that is to say none is admonished but the people of pith possessors of intellects."
