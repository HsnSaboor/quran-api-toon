  58,22,"You will not find a people who believe in God and the Last Day loving befriending those who oppose God and His Messenger even though they the opposers were their fathers that is to say the believers’ fathers or their sons or their brothers or their clan rather you will find that they intend to do them harm and they fight them over the question of faith as occurred on one occasion with some Companions may God be pleased with them. For those the ones who are not loving of them He has inscribed He has established faith upon their hearts and reinforced them with a spirit a light from Him exalted be He and He will admit them into gardens underneath which rivers flow wherein they will abide God being pleased with them for their obedience of Him and they being pleased with Him because of His reward. Those they are God’s confederates following His command and refraining from what He has forbidden. Assuredly it is God’s confederates who are the successful the winners."
  59,1,"All that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth glorifies God that is to say all that is in them exalts Him as being transcendent the lām of li’Llāhi ‘God’ is extra; the use of mā instead of the personal min is meant to indicate a predominance of non-rational beings in the heavens and the earth. And He is the Mighty the Wise in His kingdom and in His actions respectively."
  59,2,"It is He Who expelled those who disbelieved of the People of the Scripture namely the Jews of the Banū al-Nadīr from their homelands from their dwellings at Medina at the first exile that is their exile to Syria the last exile being their banishment to Khaybar by ‘Umar during his caliphate. You did not think O believers that they would go forth and they thought that they would be protected māni‘atuhum is the predicate of an ‘that’ by their fortresses husūnuhum the agent of the verb māni‘atuhum with which the predication is completed from God from His chastisement. But God His command and His chastisement came at them from whence they had not reckoned from whence had never occurred to them from the part of the believers and He cast terror ru‘b or ru‘ub into their hearts by having their chief Ka‘b b. al-Ashraf slain destroying as they did read yukharribūna; or yukhribūna derived from 4th form akhraba their houses in order to take away with them what they valued of wood and so on with their own hands and the hands of the believers. So take heed O you who have eyes!"
  59,3,"And had God not prescribed had He not decreed banishment for them departure from their homeland He would have chastised them in this world by having them killed or taken captive as He did with the Jews of Banū Qurayza and in the Hereafter there is for them the chastisement of the Fire."
