tafsir[8]{c,v,t}:
  8,9,"When you sought help from your Lord asking Him to help you by granting you victory over them and He answered you saying ‘I shall reinforce you I shall assist you with a thousand angels rank upon rank’ one rank following after the next God promised them this number at first but it then became three thousand and then five thousand as stated in sūrat Āl ‘Imrān Q. 3124-125 a variant reading of alf ‘thousand’ has the plural āluf ‘thousands’ similar in pattern to aflus ‘coins’."
  8,10,"And God appointed it that is the reinforcement only as good tidings and that your hearts might thereby be reassured. Victory comes only from God surely God is Mighty Wise."
  8,11,"Remember when He caused slumber to overcome you as security against the fear that had befallen you from Him from God and sent down upon you water from the heaven to purify you thereby from minor and major ritual impurities; and to remove from you the evil of Satan his whisperings to you that had you been on the right path you would not have been thirsty and impure while the idolaters enjoyed access to water; and to strengthen to seal your hearts with certainty and endurance; and to make firm your feet lest they sink in the sand."
  8,12,"When your Lord inspired the angels with whom He reinforced the Muslims saying ‘I am with you with assistance and victorious help so make the believers stand firm by helping them and giving them good tidings. I shall cast terror fear into the hearts of the disbelievers; so smite above the necks that is the heads and smite of them every finger!’ that is smite the extremities of their hands and feet thus when one of them went to strike an disbeliever’s head it would roll off before his sword reached it. The Prophet s threw a handful of pebbles against them and every single idolater was struck in his eye and thus they were defeated."
  8,13,"That chastisement befalling them is because they had contended with they had opposed God and His Messenger whoever contends with God and with His Messenger surely God is severe in retribution against him."
  8,14,"That chastisement is for you so taste it O disbelievers in this world; and know that for the disbelievers in the Hereafter is the chastisement of the Fire."
  8,15,"O you who believe when you encounter the disbelievers inching forward that is amassed advancing slowly because of their large numbers do not turn your backs to them fleeing."
  8,16,"Whoever turns his back to them on that day the day of the encounter with them unless manœuvring turning around for battle — by pretending to be in flight as a trick while actually intending to relaunch an attack — or joining another detachment a company of Muslims calling on it for assistance he has truly incurred the wrath of God and his abode will be Hell — an evil journey’s end! an evil return it is. This threat applies so long as the numbers of disbelievers do not surpass twice that of the believers."
