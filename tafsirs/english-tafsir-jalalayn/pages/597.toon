tafsir[27]{c,v,t}:
  95,1,"By the fig and the olive that is the two edible foods — or these denote the names of two mountains in Syria on which these two foods grow —"
  95,2,"and by the Mount Sinai the mountain on which God exalted be He spoke to Moses sīnīn means ‘the one blessed’ or ‘the fair one with fruitful trees’"
  95,3,"and by this secure land Mecca as people were secure in it in the time of pagandom and are still secure in it in Islam."
  95,4,"Verily We created man al-insān the generic in the best of forms in the best proportioning of his shape."
  95,5,"Then in the case of certain individuals of his species We reduced him to the lowest of the low — a metaphor for old age and weakness at which point a believer’s deeds are fewer than when he was young; but he will still have his reward as God exalted be He says"
  95,6,"except those who believe and perform righteous deeds for they shall have an unfailing reward one unending — in a hadīth it is stated ‘When a believer reaches that stage of old age which prevents him from performing good deeds then what he used to do is recorded in his favour instead’."
  95,7,"So what makes you deny O disbeliever thereafter — after the mention of man being created in the best of forms and his being reduced to the vilest of age all of which indicates the power of God to resurrect — the Judgement? the Requital that will be preceded by the Resurrection and the Reckoning. In other words what makes you disbelieve in all this? Nothing does!"
  95,8,"Is not God the fairest of all judges? the most just of all judges. His passing judgement by means of the process of requital is one such example. In a hadīth it is stated ‘Whoever recites sūrat wa’l-tīni ‘By the fig’ to the end of it let him then say “Yes Indeed! And I am of those who bear witness to this!” ’"
  96,1,"Recite bring recitation into existence beginning with In the Name of your Lord Who created all creatures;"
  96,2,"created man al-insān the generic from a blood-clot ‘alaq is the plural of ‘alaqa which is a small quantity of congealing blood."
  96,3,"Recite reiterating the first one and your Lord is the Most Generous having no counterpart in terms of His generosity wa-rabbuka’l-akram is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the subject of the verb iqra’ ‘recite’"
  96,4,"Who taught the art of script by the pen — the first to write with it was the prophet Enoch Idrīs peace be upon him —"
  96,5,"taught man al-insān the generic what he did not know before he was taught in the way of guidance the art of writing crafts and so on."
  96,6,"Nay but verily man is wont to be rebellious"
  96,7,"when he sees it that is to say his own soul to be self-sufficient in terms of wealth — this was revealed regarding Abū Jahl ra’ā ‘sees’ means to see mentally; istaghnā ‘self-sufficient’ is the second direct object; an ra’āhu ‘when he sees it’ is an object denoting reason."
  96,8,"Surely to your Lord O man is the return — meant as a threat for him — and so He will requite the rebellious one with what he deserves."
  96,9,"Have you seen a-ra’ayta in all three instances here and below is an exclamation of wonder him namely Abū Jahl who forbids"
  96,10,"a servant namely Muhammad (s) when he prays?"
  96,11,"Have you considered what if he the one forbidden should be upon a path of guidance"
  96,12,"or aw is for division be bidding others to fear of God?"
  96,13,"Have you considered what if he the one forbidding the Prophet should be denying God’s guidance and turning away? from faith."
  96,14,"Is he not aware that God sees? what has issued from him that is to say He does indeed know it and will requite him for it. In other words ‘Marvel O you being addressed at the way in which he forbids prayer and at the fact that the one being forbidden is actually the one upon guidance bidding to fear of God while the one forbidding is a denier disregarding faith’."
  96,15,"No indeed! — a repudiation of him — Assuredly if la-in the lām is for oaths he does not desist from the disbelief that he is upon We shall seize him by the forelock We shall drag him to the Fire by his forelock"
  96,16,"a lying iniquitous forelock! nāsiyatin an indefinite noun substituting for a definite — the description of this forelock in such terms is meant figuratively and what is actually meant is that individual."
  96,17,"Let him then call upon the henchmen of his council the members of his council nādin — a place of assembly where people gather to talk. He Abū Jahl had said to the Prophet s in reproof having forbidden him from prayer ‘You are well aware that there is none in this town who has recourse to as large a council of men as I do. Verily I shall fill this entire valley with mature steeds and young men in battle against you if you so wish!’"
  96,18,"We shall call the Zabāniya the grim stern angels to destroy him as stated in the hadīth ‘Had he called his council of henchmen together the Zabāniya would have seized him right before his own eyes!’."
  96,19,"No indeed! — a repudiation of him — Do not obey him O Muhammad (s) and abandon prayer and prostrate yourself perform prayer to God and draw near to Him through obedience to Him."
