tafsir[8]{c,v,t}:
  18,46,"Wealth and children are an adornment of the life of this world adornment with which one arrays oneself therein. But the enduring things the righteous deeds — and these are ‘Glory be to God’ subhāna’Llāh ‘Praise be to God’ al-hāmdu li’Llāh ‘There is no god but God lā ilāha illā’Llāh ‘God is Great’ Allāhu akbar; some add the following ‘There is no power or strength except in God’ lā hawla wa-lā quwwata illā bi’Llāh — these are better with your Lord for reward and better in respect of hope in other words they are better in terms of what a person hopes for and desires from God exalted be He."
  18,47,"And mention the day when the mountains shall be set in motion — they shall be removed from the face of the earth and become ‘as scattered dust’ Q. 566 a variant reading for tusayyaru’l-jibālu has nusayyiru’l-jibāla ‘We shall set the mountains in motion’ and you will see the earth exposed manifest in full view with no mountain or anything else on top of it. And We shall gather them believers and disbelievers such that We will not leave out anyone of them."
  18,48,"And they shall be presented before your Lord in ranks saffan is a circumstantial qualifier in other words ranged so that every community is in a row on its own and it shall be said to them ‘Verily you have come to Us just as We created you the first time that is to say individually barefoot naked and uncircumcised; and it shall be said to the deniers of the Resurrection rather you claimed that a of allan is an softened in place of the hardened one in other words it is to be understood as annahu We would not appoint for you a tryst’ for resurrection."
  18,49,"And the Book shall be set in place the Book of every man — in his right hand if he is from among the believers and in his left hand if he is from among the disbelievers. And you will see the guilty the disbelievers apprehensive fearful of what is in it and they will say when they observe the evil deeds recorded in it ‘O yā is for exclamation woe to us! O this is our destruction! this form waylatanā is a verbal noun but in this form it cannot be conjugated as a verb What is it with this Book that it leaves out neither small nor great from among our sins but instead it has counted it?’ enumerated it and fixed it in the record — they are stupefied by it in this respect. And they shall find all that they did present fixed in writing in their individual Book. And your Lord does not wrong anyone He does not punish him if he is without guilt nor does He diminish anything of the reward of a believer."
  18,50,"And when idh is dependent because it is governed by an implicit udhkur ‘mention when’ We said to the angels ‘Prostrate before Adam’ a prostration involving a bow not placing one’s forehead down to the ground as a greeting to him; and so they prostrated all except Iblīs. He was one of the jinn — some say that these creatures are a species of angels in which case the exceptive clause illā Iblīs ‘except Iblīs’ is a continuous one; but it is also said to be discontinuous since Iblīs is considered the progenitor of all the jinn having offspring who are mentioned alongside him further below; angels on the other hand do not have offspring; and he transgressed against his Lord’s command that is to say he rebelled against obedience to Him by refraining from performing the prostration. Will you then take him and his offspring — this address is to Adam and his progeny the final pronominal suffix hā’ in both words refers to Iblīs for your patrons instead of Me obeying them when they are an enemy to you? in other words when they are your enemies wa-hum lakum ‘aduwwun is a circumstantial qualifier. How evil for the evildoers is that substitute! of Iblīs and his offspring in obeying them instead of obeying God."
  18,51,"I did not make them a witness that is Iblīs and his offspring to the creation of the heavens and the earth nor to their own creation that is to say I did not make any of them present at the moment of the creation of the other. Nor do I take misleaders devils as My support as assistants in the process of creation so why do you obey them?"
  18,52,"And the day yawma is in the accusative because it is governed by the implicit udhkur ‘mention’ when He will say yaqūl or it may be read as naqūl ‘We will say’ ‘Call those partners of Mine those graven images as you used to claim’ let them intercede for you in the way you used to claim; and then they will call them but they will not respond to their call they will not answer them and We shall set between them between the graven images and those who worship them a gulf of doom — a valley from among the valleys of Hell in which they shall all be destroyed the term mawbiq derives from the verb wabaqa meaning halaka ‘he was destroyed’."
  18,53,"And the criminals will behold the Fire and realise that are certain that they are about to fall into it. And they will find no means of avoiding it of circumventing it."
