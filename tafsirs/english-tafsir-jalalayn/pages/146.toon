tafsir[5]{c,v,t}:
  6,138,"They say ‘These cattle and tillage are sacrosanct forbidden. No one is to eat of them except whom we will’ from among the retainers of the graven images and others — so they assert in other words they have no convincing argument for it — ‘and cattle whose backs have been forbidden and cannot therefore be ridden such as the camels they call Sā’ibas or Hāmīs and cattle over which they do not invoke the Name of God’ when they slaughter them invoking instead the names of their idols ascribing such rules to God; forging lies against Him. He will assuredly requite them for what they used to fabricate against Him."
  6,139,"And they say ‘That which is within the bellies of these forbidden cattle namely the camels they call Sā’ibas or Bahīras is reserved permitted for our males and forbidden to our spouses that is the women; but if it be dead read maytatun or maytatan and the verb as either feminine takun or masculine yakun ‘if it be’ then they all may be partakers thereof’. He God will assuredly requite them for their describing this and that as either permitted or forbidden with the appropriate requital thereof. Surely He is Wise in His actions Knowing of His creatures."
  6,140,"They are losers who slay read qatalū or qattalū their children by burying them alive in folly out of ignorance without knowledge and have forbidden what God has provided them of what has been mentioned in calumny against God. Verily they have gone astray and are not guided."
  6,141,"And He it is Who produces creates gardens orchards trellised extending along the ground as in the case of watermelons and untrellised rising upwards on a stem such as palm-trees; and He produces palm-trees and crops diverse in flavour diverse in the shape and savour of its fruit and seed and olives and pomegranates alike in terms of their leaf mutashābihan ‘alike’ is a circumstantial qualifier and unlike in terms of their savour. Eat of the fruit thereof when it ripens before its maturity passes and pay the due thereof the alms as appropriate on the day of its harvest read yawma hasādahu or yawma hasādihi that is one tenth or half of it and do not be prodigal by giving it all away so that nothing remains for the consumption of your dependants. Truly God does not love the prodigal who overstep the bounds of that which He has delimited for them."
  6,142,"And He produces of the cattle some for burden fit to bear loads such as the large mature camels and some for light support not fit for these load-bearing tasks such as young camels or sheep such cattle are called farsh because they are like ‘bedding farsh spread on the ground’ on account of their physical closeness to it; eat of that which God has provided you and do not follow the steps of Satan his methods of forbidding things or deeming them lawful. Surely he is a manifest foe to you one whose enmity is evident."
