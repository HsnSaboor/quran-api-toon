tafsir[13]{c,v,t}:
  18,62,"And when they had made the traverse of that location having journeyed until the morning of the following day he Moses said to his lad ‘Bring us our breakfast ghadā’ that meal which is consumed at the beginning of the day. We have certainly encountered on this journey of ours much fatigue’ exhaustion which took its effect on them after the traverse."
  18,63,"He said ‘Do you see? — in other words remember when we sheltered at the rock in that location indeed I forgot the fish — and none but Satan made me forget al-shaytān ‘Satan’ substitutes for the suffixed pronoun hā’ of ansānī-hu to mention it an adhkurahu an inclusive substitution in other words it should be understood as ansānī dhikrahu ‘he Satan made me forget the mentioning of it’ — and it the fish made its way into the sea in an amazing manner’ ‘ajaban constitutes the second direct object that is to say Moses and his lad were amazed by it because of what has already been explained concerning it."
  18,64,"Said he Moses ‘That namely our losing the fish is what we have been seeking!’ what we have been after for it is a sign for us of the presence of the one whom we seek. So they turned back retracing their footsteps until they reached the rock."
  18,65,"So there they found one of Our servants namely al-Khidr to whom We had given mercy from Us — according to one opinion this mercy was prophethood; according to another it was authority and this latter is the opinion of the majority of scholars — and We had taught him knowledge from Us ‘ilman is the second direct object in other words some knowledge of unseen things; al-Bukhārī reports the following hadīth ‘Moses was delivering a sermon among the Children of Israel and was asked “Who is the most knowledgeable of people?” to which he Moses said “Myself”. God then reproached him for not having attributed his knowledge as coming from Him. God then revealed to him the following “Truly there is a servant of Mine at the juncture of the two seas; he is more knowledgeable than you”. Moses then asked “My Lord how do I reach him?” He God said ‘Take a fish with you and place it in a basket and the place where you lose the fish will be the place where he is.” He Moses took a fish and placed it in a basket and departed together with his lad Joshua son of Nun until they reached the rock. There they placed their heads back and fell asleep. The fish began to move about in the basket until it escaped from it and fell into the sea and it made its way into the sea in an amazing manner. God then held back the flow of the water preventing it from engulfing the fish forming a kind of arch over it. When he awoke his companion Joshua forgot to inform him of what had happened to the fish and so they journeyed on for the remainder of that day and night until on the morning of the second day Moses said to his lad ‘Bring us our breakfast’ to where he says and it made its way into the sea in an amazing manner’. He Bukhārī said ‘For the fish it the way into the sea was by ‘burrowing’ saraban and for Moses and his lad it this way was ‘amazing’ ‘ajaban …’ and so on to the end of Bukhārī’s report."
  18,66,"Moses said to him ‘May I follow you for the purpose that you teach me of what you have been taught in the way of probity?’ namely something of right conduct through which I might be rightly-guided a variant reading for rashadan has rushdan ‘probity’; he asked him this because to increase one’s knowledge is something which is always sought."
  18,67,"Said he ‘Truly you will not be able to bear with me."
  18,68,"And how can you bear with that whereof you have never been informed?’ in the above-mentioned hadīth of Bukhārī after this verse there is the following statement ‘O Moses I possess knowledge which God has taught me and which you do not have and equally you possess knowledge which God has taught you and which I do not have’. His saying khubran ‘informed’ is a verbal noun meaning that which you have never encompassed in other words the truth of which you have never been informed of."
  18,69,"He said ‘You will find me God willing patient and I will not disobey in other words and you will also find me non-disobedient towards you in any matter’ with which you charge me. He Moses made this statement conditional upon the Will of God because he was not confident of himself in what he had committed himself to. Indeed this is the custom of prophets and saints namely that they do not put their trust in themselves for a single moment."
  18,70,"He said ‘If you follow me then do not question me lā tas’alnī a variant reading has lā tas’alannī concerning anything that you might find objectionable in what I do according to your limited knowledge and be patient until I myself make mention of it to you’ in other words until I mention it to you with an explication of the reason for it. Moses accepted his precondition bearing in mind the respect which a student should exercise in the presence of a teacher."
  18,71,"So they set off making their way on foot along the coast of the sea until when they embarked on the ship which was carrying them he al-Khidr made a hole in it by destroying a plank or two on the starboard side with an axe after they had sailed into deep waters. Said he Moses to him ‘Did you make a hole in it to drown its people? li-tughriqa ahlahā ‘for you to drown its people’; a variant reading has li-yaghraqa ahluhā ‘so that its people might drown’. You have certainly done a dreadful thing’ that is a grave and reprehensible thing — it is reported that the water did not actually penetrate it."
  18,72,"He said ‘Did I not say that you would not be able to bear with me?’"
  18,73,"He said ‘Do not take me to task on account of that which I forgot that is on account of the fact that I was not mindful of submitting to you in the matter and of refraining from showing disapproval of your actions and do not exhaust me do not charge me in this affair of mine with difficulty’ with hardship during my companionship of you in other words treat me throughout it with forgiveness and indulgence."
  18,74,"So they set off after leaving the ship making their way on foot until when they met a boy who had not yet reached puberty playing with other boys among whom his face was the fairest — and he al-Khidr slew him by slitting his throat with a knife while he lay down or by tearing his head off with his hand or by smashing his head against a wall all of which are different opinions the coordinating fā’ of fa-qatalahu ‘and he slew him’ is used here because it indicates that the slaying took place after the encounter; the response to idhā ‘when’ is the following statement qāla … — he Moses said to him ‘Have you slain an innocent soul that is a pure one that had not reached the age of legal responsibility a variant reading for zākiya has zakiyya one slain not in retaliation for another soul? in other words one that has not slain any soul. Verily you have committed an dreadful thing’ read nukran or nukuran that is to say an abomination."
