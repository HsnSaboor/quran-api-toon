tafsir[11]{c,v,t}:
  21,25,"And We did not send any Messenger before you but We revealed to him read nūhī or yūhā ‘but it was revealed to him’ that ‘There is no god except Me so worship Me’ that is affirm My Oneness."
  21,26,"And they say ‘The Compassionate One has taken a son’ from the angels. Glory be to Him! Nay but they are merely servants who are honoured in His presence; for the very servitude of all creatures to Him is inconsistent with the attribution of any of them as progeny of His."
  21,27,"They do not venture to speak before Him — they only speak after He has spoken and they act according to His command that is following His issuing of it."
  21,28,"He knows what is before them and what is behind them that is what they have done and what they will do and they do not intercede except for him with whom He is satisfied that he be interceded for and they for awe of Him exalted be He are apprehensive fearful."
  21,29,"And should any of them say ‘I am a god besides Him’ that is besides God in other words a god other than Him — and this is Iblīs who summoned others to worship his soul and commanded that it be obeyed — such a one We will requite with Hell. Thus in the same way that We requite him We requite wrong-doers idolaters."
  21,30,"Have they not one may read a-wa-lam or a-lam realised have they not come to know those who disbelieve that the heavens and the earth were closed together and then We parted them We made seven heavens and seven earths — or it is meant that the heaven was parted and began to rain when it did not use to do so and that the earth was parted and began to produce plants when it did not use to do so; and We made of water the water that falls from the heaven and that springs from the earth every living thing? in the way of plants and otherwise in other words water is the cause of such things having life. Will they not then believe? by affirming My Oneness?"
  21,31,"And We set in the earth firm mountains lest it should shake with them and We set in them in the firm mountains ravines as roads subulan substitutes for fijājan ‘ravines’ which are wide through-routes that perhaps they may be guided to their destinations during travel."
  21,32,"And We made the heaven a roof for the earth functioning like the roof of a house preserved from collapsing; and yet of the signs thereof namely the signs of this heaven such as the sun the moon and the stars they are disregardful failing to reflect on them and thus realise that the Creator of such things can have no partner."
  21,33,"And He it is Who created the night and the day and the sun and the moon each kullun the nunation of this particle stands in place of the second noun of the genitive construction that would have been al-shams ‘the sun’ or al-qamar ‘the moon’ or their subsidiaries namely al-nujūm ‘the stars’ in an orbit a circular one like a mill in the sky swimming moving with speed like a swimmer in water. In order to effect the analogy with the latter the plural person of the verb employed for rational beings is used."
  21,34,"When the disbelievers said that Muhammad (s) would die the following was revealed And We did not assign to any human being before you immortality permanence of life in this world. What if you are fated to die will they be immortal? in it? No! The last sentence constitutes the syntactical locus of the interrogative of denial."
  21,35,"Every soul shall taste death in this world and We will try you We will test you with ill and good such as poverty and wealth sickness and health as an ordeal fitnatan an object denoting reason in other words for the purpose of seeing whether you will be patient and give thanks or not. And then unto Us you shall be brought back that We may requite you."
