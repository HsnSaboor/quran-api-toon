Indeed they were destroyed at Badr even though they had never anticipated it."
  16,46,"Or that He will not seize them in their going to and fro during their travels for commerce whereupon they will not be able to escape? whereupon they will not be able to elude the chastisement."

  16,49,"And to God prostrates whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth of living creatures that is of every single thing that moves thereupon; in other words to Him it everything is subservient in terms of what is required of it — most of what is given by way of example is non-rational since these are the more numerous — and the angels also prostrate — these are singled out for mention because of their merit — and they are not arrogant they do not disdain to worship Him."
