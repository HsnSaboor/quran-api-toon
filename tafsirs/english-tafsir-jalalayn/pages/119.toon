tafsir[6]{c,v,t}:
  5,65,"But had the People of the Scripture believed in Muhammad (s) and feared unbelief We would have absolved them of their evil deeds and We would admitted them to Gardens of Bliss."
  5,66,"And had they observed the Torah and the Gospel by implementing what is in them including believing in the Prophet s and what was revealed to them of scriptures from their Lord they would surely have received nourishment from above them and from beneath their feet by their being given provision in abundance with it pouring forth from every place. Some of them a group among them are a just community implementing it the Torah and they are the ones who believed in the Prophet s the likes of ‘Abd Allāh b. Salām and his companions; but many of them — evil is that thing which they do."
  5,67,"O Messenger make known all of that which has been revealed to you from your Lord and do not conceal any of it out of fear that you may suffer some harm; for if you do not that is if you do not make known all of what has been revealed to you you will not have conveyed His Message risālatahu or read plural risālātihi ‘His Messages’ since to conceal some of it is to conceal it all. God will protect you from people who may try to kill you. The Prophet s used to have guards up until the time that this verse was revealed then he said ‘Depart for God protects me now’ as reported by al-Hākim. God does not guide the unbelieving folk."
  5,68,"Say ‘O People of the Scripture you have no basis in religion on which to rely until you observe the Torah and the Gospel and what was revealed to you from your Lord’ by implementing what is therein including believing in me Muhammad (s). And what has been revealed to you from your Lord of the Qur’ān will surely increase many of them in insolence and disbelief because of their disbelief in it; so do not grieve for the disbelieving folk if they do not believe in you in other words do not be concerned with them."
  5,69,"Surely those who believe and those of Jewry this constitutes the subject of the clause namely the Jews and the Sabaeans a sect among them and the Christians and what follows substitutes for the above subject whoever of them believes in God and the Last Day and behaves righteously — no fear shall befall them neither shall they grieve in the Hereafter this fa-lā khawfun ‘alayhim wa-lā hum yahzanūn ‘no fear shall befall them neither shall they grieve’ is the predicate of the subject and also indicates the predicate of the clause beginning with inna ‘surely’."
  5,70,"And We made a covenant with the Children of Israel to believe in God and His messengers and We sent messengers to them. Every time a messenger came to them from among them with what their souls did not desire in the way of truth they denied it; some of them they denied and some of them they slay such as Zachariah and John the use of the present tense yaqtulūn ‘they slay’ instead of the perfect tense qatalū is to narrate past events as if in the present and to conclude in harmony with the end-rhyme of the verses."
