tafsir[8]{c,v,t}:
  10,54,"And if each soul that has done wrong that has disbelieved had all that is in the earth of riches it would offer it as ransom against chastisement on the Day of Resurrection; and they will feel remorse within them for having neglected faith when they see the chastisement their leaders keep it their remorse secret from the weak ones whom they had led astray fearing reproach but it has been decided justly between them between all creatures and they are not wronged in anything."
  10,55,"Why surely to God belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth. Why surely God’s promise of resurrection and requital is true is fixed but most of them people do not know this."
  10,56,"He gives life and makes to die and to Him you shall be returned in the Hereafter and He shall requite you for your deeds."
  10,57,"O people that is inhabitants of Mecca there has come to you an admonition from your Lord a Book which contains mention of that which is permissible for you and that which is enjoined on you and this Book is the Qur’ān; and a healing a cure for what is in the breasts of corrupt beliefs and uncertainties and a guidance from error and a mercy for those who believe in it."
  10,58,"Say ‘In the bounty of God that is Islam and in His mercy the Qur’ān in that bounty and mercy let them rejoice it is better than what they hoard’ in this world read yajma‘ūn ‘they hoard’ and tajma‘ūn ‘you hoard’."
  10,59,"Say ‘Have you considered inform me what provision God has revealed has created for you how you have made some of it unlawful and some lawful?’ as in the case of the camels called al-Bahīra or al-Sā’iba and carrion. Say ‘Has God given you permission to make that lawful or unlawful? No! Or do you nay you invent lies concerning God?’ by attributing that to Him."
  10,60,"And what do they suppose those who invent lies concerning God will happen to them on the Day of Resurrection? do they reckon that He will not chastise them? No! Truly God is Bountiful to mankind by granting them respite and bestowing graces upon them but most of them do not give thanks."
  10,61,"And you O Muhammad (s) are not occupied with any business any matter nor do you recite anything regarding it that is regarding such a matter — or it means nor do you recite anything from God by way of the Qur’ān which He has revealed to you nor do you perform any action God is addressing him and his community but We are witnesses watchers over you when you are engaged therein that is in the action. And not so much as the weight of an atom the weight of the smallest ant in the earth or in the heaven escapes is hidden from your Lord nor what is less than that or greater but it is in a clear a manifest Book namely the Preserved Tablet al-lawh al-mahfūz."
