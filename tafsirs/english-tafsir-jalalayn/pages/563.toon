tafsir[14]{c,v,t}:
  67,13,"And whether you keep secret O people your speech or proclaim it He indeed exalted be He is Knower of what is in the breasts of what they contain so how much more so is He Knower in the case of what you utter openly — the reason for the revelation of this verse was that the idolaters said to one another ‘Speak secretly and Muhammad’s god will not hear you’."
  67,14,"Will He Who has created not know? what you keep secret in other words will His knowledge of things be precluded by such secret speech? And He is the Subtle in His knowledge the Aware therein."
  67,15,"It is He Who made the earth tractable for you easy for you to walk on; so walk in its flanks and eat of His provision that has been created for you; and to Him is the resurrection from the graves for the Requital."
  67,16,"Are you secure read a-amintum pronouncing both hamzas fully or by not pronouncing the second one inserting an alif between it and the other one or without the insertion but replacing it with an alif instead in thinking that He Who is in the heaven that He Whose authority and power is in the heaven will not cause the earth to swallow you an yakhsifa substitutes for man ‘He Who’ while it quakes? while it moves underneath you and rises above you?"
  67,17,"Are you secure in thinking that He Who is in the heaven will not unleash an yursila substitutes for man ‘He Who’ upon you a squall of pebbles? a wind hurling pebbles at you. But you will soon come to know upon seeing the chastisement with your own eyes the nature of My warning My warning of chastisement in other words you will soon see that it was true."
  67,18,"And verily those communities who were before them denied then see how was My rebuttal! how was My rebuttal of them in destroying them when they denied in other words how it was true."
  67,19,"Or have they not seen the birds above them in the air spreading their wings and closing? their wings after spreading them? in other words read wa-yaqbidna as wa-qābidātin similar to sāffātin ‘spreading’. Nothing sustains them from falling either when they are spreading them or closing them except the Compassionate One by His power. Indeed He is Seer of all things. The meaning is have they not inferred from the fact that the birds are able to remain in the air that We have the power to do with them what has been mentioned above as well as inflicting upon them other kinds of chastisement?"
  67,20,"Or who am-man the subject is it hādhā its predicate that alladhī a substitution for hādhā ‘is it’ will be an army supporters for you lakum belongs to the relative clause of alladhī ‘that’ to help you yansurukum is an adjectival qualification of jundun ‘an army’ besides the Compassionate One? that is to say other than Him who is there that will be able to avert His chastisement from you in other words you have no helper. The disbelievers are in nothing but delusion Satan has deluded them into believing that the chastisement will not befall them."
  67,21,"Or who is it that will provide for you if He the Compassionate One withholds His provision? that is to say if He withholds the rain from you the response to the conditional has been omitted but is indicated by what preceded it namely the statement to the effect ‘who will provide for you?’ and so the response would be you have no provider other than Him. Nay but they persist in disdain and aversion moving away further from the truth."
  67,22,"Is he who walks cast down fallen on his face more rightly guided or he who walks upright on a straight path? the predicate of the second man ‘who’ has been omitted but is indicated by the predicate of the first namely ahdā ‘more rightly guided’; the similitude refers to the believer and the disbeliever and to which of the two is more rightly guided."
  67,23,"Say ‘It is He Who created you and endowed you with hearing and sight and hearts. Little do you thank!’ mā tashkurūna mā is extra; the sentence itself is a new independent one informing of how extremely little they give thanks for these graces."
  67,24,"Say ‘It is He Who multiplied you created you on earth and to Him you will be gathered’ for the Reckoning."
  67,25,"And they say to the believers ‘When will this promise be fulfilled the promise of the gathering if you are truthful?’ about it."
  67,26,"Say ‘The knowledge of its coming is only with God and I am but a plain warner’ one whose warning is plain."
