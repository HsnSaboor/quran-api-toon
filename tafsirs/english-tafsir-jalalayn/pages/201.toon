tafsir[7]{c,v,t}:
  9,87,"They are content to be with those who stay behind khawālif is the plural of khālifa meaning the women who ‘stay behind’ takhallafna at home and a seal has been set upon their hearts so they do not understand what is good."
  9,88,"But the Messenger and those who believe with him strive with their wealth and their lives for them are the good things in this life and in the Hereafter; those they are the successful the triumphant."
  9,89,"God has prepared for them Gardens underneath which rivers flow to abide therein that is the supreme triumph."
  9,90,"And those Bedouins who had an excuse al-mu‘adhdhirūn the original tā’ has been assimilated with the dāl in other words it would usually be read as al-mu‘tadhirūn which itself is a variant reading those of them who were excused came to the Prophet s asking for leave to stay behind on account of their excuses and so he gave them leave to do so. And those who lied to God and His Messenger by feigning belief those hypocrites among the Bedouin stayed behind refraining from coming to give their excuses — a painful chastisement shall befall those of them who disbelieve."
  9,91,"As for the weak such as the old and the sick the blind and the chronically ill and those who find nothing to expend for the struggle no blame no sin falls upon them should they stay away from it if they remain true to God and to His Messenger when they stay behind by not spreading false rumours or impeding others from joining the struggle but by adhering to obedience. There is no way of blame no way of reproach against those who are virtuous through such behaviour. And God is Forgiving Merciful to them by granting them such leeway in this matter."
  9,92,"Nor against those who when they came to you so that you might give them a mount to ride with you on the raid — these were seven men of the Ansār; but it is also said that they were the Banū Muqrin — you having said to them ‘I cannot find a mount whereon to mount you’ this last sentence is a circumstantial qualifier turned back this is the response to the clause beginning with idhā ‘when’ that is they departed their eyes flowing pouring with tears min al-dam‘i min is explicative for sorrow that they could not find the means to expend for the campaign struggle."
  9,93,"The way of blame is only against those who ask leave of you to stay behind when they are rich. They are content to be with those who stay behind and God has set a seal on their hearts so that they do not know a similar statement has already been made."
