tafsir[9]{c,v,t}:
  6,19,"When they said to the Prophet s ‘Bring us someone to testify to the truth of your prophethood for the People of the Scripture have denied you’ the following was revealed Say to them ‘What thing is greatest in testimony?’ shahādatan this is for specification and is derived from the implied subject of the sentence. Say ‘God — even if they do not say this there is no other response — He is Witness between me and you to my truthfulness; and this Qur’ān has been revealed to me that I may warn you that I may make you fear O people of Mecca thereby and whomever it may reach wa-man balagha this is a supplement to the suffixed pronoun ‘you’ of undhira-kum ‘I may warn you’ that is to say whomever among men and jinn the Qur’ān may reach. Do you indeed bear witness that there are other gods with God?’ this interrogative is meant as a disavowal. Say to them ‘I do not bear witness’ to this. Say ‘He is only One God and I am innocent of what you associate’ with Him of idols."
  6,20,"Those to whom We have given the Scripture recognise him that is Muhammad (s) by the descriptions of him in their Scripture as they recognise their sons; those of them who have forfeited their own souls do not believe in him."
  6,21,"And who that is none does greater evil than he who invents a lie against God by ascribing to Him an associate or denies His signs? the Qur’ān; it is verily the case that they the evildoers shall not prosper on account of this."
  6,22,"And mention on the day We shall gather them all together then We shall say in rebuke to those who associated other gods with God ‘Where are those associates of yours whom you were claiming?’ to be associates of God?"
  6,23,"Then their dissension read accusative fitnatahum or nominative fitnatuhum their apology was read lam takun or lam yakun only to say in other words was only their saying ‘By God our Lord read rabbinā as an adjective of wa’Llāhi ‘by God’ or rabbanā as a vocative we were never idolaters’."
  6,24,"God exalted be He says See O Muhammad (s) how they lie against themselves by denying that their idolatry and how that which they were forging against God in the way of associates has failed is absent before them!"
  6,25,"And there are some of them who listen to you when you recite and We have placed veils covers upon their hearts so that they do not understand it so that they do not comprehend the Qur’ān; and in their ears a heaviness a deafness so that they do not hear it with a willingness to accept it. And if they were to see every sign they would not believe in it so that when they come to you to argue with you the disbelievers say ‘This Qur’ān is nothing but the fables the lies of the ancients’ similar to their jokes and strange tales asātīr ‘fables’ is the plural of ustūra."
  6,26,"And to people they forbid it the following of the Prophet s and keep away from it and so they do not believe in him it is said that this was revealed regarding Abū Tālib who used to forbid people from hurting him but did not himself believe in him; and it is only themselves they destroy when they keep away from him because the harm thereof will befall them but they do not perceive this."
  6,27,"If you O Muhammad (s) could see when they are made to stand when they are exposed before the Fire and they say ‘Oh yā is for exclamation would that we might be returned to the world; then we would not deny the signs of our Lord but we would be among the believers!’ read nukadhdhibu and nakūnu as a new independent sentence; or read nukadhdhiba and nakūna as the subjunctive response to the optative clause; or read nukadhdhibu and nakūna. The response to the clause ‘if you could see’ would be ‘you would be seeing a terrible thing indeed’."
