tafsir[13]{c,v,t}:
  36,28,"And We did not send mā here is for negation down on his people namely Habīb’s after him after his death any host from the heaven that is any angels to destroy them nor do We ever send down any angels to destroy anyone."
  36,29,"It their punishment was but one Cry — Gabriel gave a cry to them — and lo! they were extinguished silent dead."
  36,30,"Ah the anguish for servants such as these and their like from among those who denied the messengers and were destroyed this word hasra denotes ‘extreme agony’; the vocative here is being used metaphorically in other words ‘It is time for you O anguish so come now!’. Never did a messenger come to them but that they mocked him this statement is given as an explanation of the cause thereof of the ‘agony’ since it the statement entails their mockery which itself results in their being destroyed and which in turn is the cause of the ‘anguish’."
  36,31,"Have they — that is those inhabitants of Mecca who said to the Prophet ‘You have not been sent by God!’ Q. 1343 — not seen not come to know the interrogative is meant rhetorically as an affirmative how many kam here is predicative as opposed to interrogative in other words it is to be understood as kathīran ‘many’; it is operated by the statement that comes next below and it comments on the operative clause for the statement that preceded it; the meaning then is as follows indeed many generations communities We have destroyed before them how that they the ones destroyed never return? to those deniers who are now alive? So will they not learn from their example? from annahum ‘how that they’ to the end of the verse is a substitution for the preceding clause kam ahlaknā qablahum mina’l-qurūni bearing in mind the aforementioned general meaning."
  36,32,"And indeed in is either for negation or is in its softened form every one of them that is every single creature kullun is the subject will be gathered jamī‘un is the predicate of the subject before Us at the Scene following their resurrection arraigned muhdarūna is a second predicate for the Reckoning read lammā with the sense of illā or lamā with the lām functioning as a separator and the mā being extra."
  36,33,"And a sign for them of the truth of resurrection wa-āyatun lahum is a preceding predicate is the dead earth read maytatu or mayyitatu which We revive with water ahyaynāhā is the subject and out of which We bring forth grain such as wheat so that they eat thereof;"
  36,34,"and We have placed therein gardens orchards of date-palms and vines and We have caused a number of springs to gush forth therein"
  36,35,"that they might eat of its fruits read thamarihi or thumurihi in other words of the fruits of the mentioned date-palms and otherwise; but it was not their hands that made it namely they did not cultivate the fruits. Will they not then give thanks? for His favours to them exalted be He?"
  36,36,"Glory be to Him Who created all the pairs the specimens of what the earth produces of seeds and other things and of themselves of males and females and of what they do not know of marvellous and strange creatures."
  36,37,"And a sign for them of the tremendous power of God is the night from which We strip We separate the day and behold they find themselves in darkness passing into the darkness of the night."
  36,38,"And the sun which runs from wa’l-shamsu tajrī to the end of the statement is subsumed by the introductory wa-āyatun lahum ‘and a sign for them’; alternatively it constitutes another sign for them; similar is the case with wa’l-qamara ‘and the moon’ further below to its resting-place in other words it does not overstep it. That namely its running is the ordaining of the Mighty in His kingdom the Knower of His creation."
  36,39,"And the moon — read wa’l-qamaru in the nominative or wa’l-qamara in the accusative; and it may be in the accusative because of a following verb that governs it We have determined it with respect to its course to run in phases — twenty eight phases in twenty eight nights of every month; it becomes concealed for two nights when the month has thirty days and for one night when it has twenty nine days — until it returns during its final phase seeming to the human eye like an aged palm-bough in other words like the stalk with a date cluster when it ages becoming delicate arched and yellowish."
  36,40,"It does not behove — it is neither facilitated nor is it right for — the sun to catch up with the moon and so appear together with it at night nor may the night outrun the day and thus it the night never arrives before the latter ends and each kullun the nunation compensates for the missing genitive annexation that would have been constructed with al-shams ‘the sun’ al-qamar ‘the moon’ and al-nujūm ‘the stars’ of these is in an orbit swimming moving — these celestial bodies are being treated as though they were rational beings."
