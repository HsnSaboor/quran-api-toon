  3,174,"So they returned from Badr with grace and bounty from God safely and with profit and no evil touched them from any slaying or wounds; and they followed the beatitude of God by obeying Him and obeying His Messenger when they agreed to set out for the battle; and God is of bounty abounding for those that obey Him."
  3,175,"That namely the one saying to you ‘The people have gathered against you’ to the end of the verse is only Satan making you fear his friends the disbelievers therefore do not fear them; but fear Me lest you abandon My command if you are truly believers."
  3,176,"Let them not grieve you read yuhzinka or yahzunka from 1st form hazanahu ‘he made him grieve’ an alternative expression to 4th form ahzanahu ‘he made him grieve’ those that vie with one another in unbelief succumbing to it promptly by supporting it namely the Meccans or the hypocrites in other words do not be concerned for their unbelief; they will not hurt God at all by their actions only hurting themselves. God desires not to assign them any portion any lot in the Hereafter that is in Paradise and that is why God forsook them; and theirs is a mighty chastisement in the Fire."
  3,177,"Those who purchase unbelief at the price of faith that is taking it in place of it they will not hurt God at all with their unbelief and there awaits them a painful chastisement alīm means mu’lim ‘painful’."
  3,178,"And let not the disbelievers suppose read lā yahsabanna ‘let them not suppose’ or lā tahsabanna ‘do not suppose’ that what We indulge them in that is that Our indulging them in extending their terms of life and deferring them their death is better for their souls in the case of the reading yahsabanna ‘let them not suppose’ anna of anna-mā and its two operators stand in place of the two objects but only in place of the second in the case of the other reading tahsabanna ‘do not suppose’. We grant them indulgence We give them respite only that they may increase in sinfulness through frequent disobedience and theirs is a humbling chastisement one of humiliation in the Hereafter."
  3,179,"It is not God’s purpose to leave to abandon the believers in the state in which you O people are where the sincere are intermingled with those otherwise till He shall distinguish read yamīza or yumayyiza till He separates the evil one the hypocrite from the good the believer through the burdensome obligations that will reveal this distinction — He did this on the Day of Uhud. And it is not God’s purpose to apprise you of the Unseen so that you could recognise the hypocrites from the others before the distinguishing; but God chooses He selects of His messengers whom He will apprising him of some of His Unseen as when He apprised the Prophet s of the position of the hypocrites. So believe in God and His messengers; and if you believe and guard against hypocrisy then yours shall be a great wage."
  3,180,"Let them not suppose read lā yahsabanna ‘let them not suppose’ or lā tahsabanna ‘do not suppose’ those who are niggardly with what God has given them of His bounty that is with His obligatory almsgiving that it their niggardliness is better for them khayrun lahum is the second direct object; the pronoun huwa ‘that it is’ is used to separate the two statements; the first direct object is bukhlahum ‘their niggardliness’ implicit before the relative clause alladhīna in the case of the reading tahsabanna sc. wa-lā tahsabanna bukhlahum ‘do not suppose their niggardliness…’ or before the pronoun huwa ‘it is’ in the case of the reading yahsabanna sc. wa-lā yahsabanna lladhīna…bukhlahum huwa khayran lahum ‘let them not suppose those who…that their niggardliness is better for them’; nay it is worse for them; what they were niggardly with namely the obligatory almsgiving of their wealth they shall have hung around their necks on the Day of Resurrection when he will have a snake around his neck biting viciously at him as reported in a hadīth; and to God belongs the inheritance of the heavens and the earth inheriting them after the annihilation of their inhabitants. And God is aware of what you do ta‘malūna also read ya‘malūna ‘they do’ and will requite you for it."
