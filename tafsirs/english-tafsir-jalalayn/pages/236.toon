tafsir[10]{c,v,t}:
  12,5,"He said ‘O my son do not relate your vision to your brothers lest they plot against you some plot lest they scheme to kill you out of envy knowing that the interpretation of the dream is that they represent the eleven planets your mother the sun and your father the moon. Truly Satan is to man a manifest foe one of evident enmity."
  12,6,"Thus in the way that you have seen will your Lord prefer you choose you and teach you the interpretation of events the interpretation of visions and perfect His grace upon you with prophethood and upon the House of Jacob — upon his sons — as He perfected it with prophethood formerly on your fathers Abraham and Isaac. Truly your Lord is Knower of His creatures Wise’ in what He does with them."
  12,7,"Verily in the tale of Joseph and his brethren — who were eleven — are signs lessons for those who inquire about their tale."
  12,8,"Mention when they that is when some of Joseph’s brothers said to some of the others ‘Surely Joseph la-Yūsufu is the subject and his brother his full brother Benjamin are dearer ahabbu is the predicate to our father than we are though we be a hardy band a group. Lo! our father is in plain aberration in manifest error for preferring those two to us."
  12,9,"Kill Joseph or cast him away into some land that is into some distant land so that your father might be solely concerned with you so that he might turn his attention to you and not be distracted by anyone else and that thereafter that is after killing Joseph or casting him away you might be a righteous folk’ by repenting."
  12,10,"One of them namely Judah said ‘Do not kill Joseph but cast him throw him into the bottom of a well ghayābat al-jubb is the darkest recess of a well; a variant reading has the plural ghayābāt so that some caravan might pick him up if you are to do anything’ of what you desire in the way of separating Joseph from us so content yourselves with this solution."
  12,11,"They said ‘O father what is wrong with you that you do not trust us with Joseph? We are indeed his well-wishers we are indeed only looking out for his best interests."
  12,12,"Send him forth with us tomorrow to the desert to frolic and play read first person plural narta‘ wa-nal‘ab ‘that we might frolic and play’ or third person plural yarta‘ wa-yal‘ab ‘that he might frolic and play’ in other words so that we might be spirited and roam freely. Surely we shall take good care of him’."
  12,13,"He said ‘Lo! It grieves me that you should go with him that is your departure with him grieves me because I would be separated from him and I fear lest the wolf devour him al-dhi’b here represents the genus for their land had many wolves in it while you are heedless of him’ distracted by something else."
  12,14,"They said ‘Truly if la-in the lām here is for oaths the wolf were to devour him when we are so hardy a band a group then we indeed are losers!’ incapable of anything. Thus he sent him off with them."
