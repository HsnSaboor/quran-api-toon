tafsir[11]{c,v,t}:
  28,60,"And whatever things you have been given are only the short-lived enjoyment of the life of this world and an ornament thereof in other words things which you enjoy and adorn yourselves with for the days of your lives after which they perish; and what is with God in other words His reward is better and more lasting. Will you not understand? ta‘qilūna; or read ya‘qilūna ‘will they not understand’ that what lasts is better than what perishes."
  28,61,"Is he to whom We have given a fair promise which he will receive which he will attain and that promise is Paradise like him to whom We have given the enjoyment of the life of this world enjoyment which will disappear soon then on the Day of Resurrection he will be of those arraigned? before the Fire. The former is the believer the latter the disbeliever in other words the two are not equal."
  28,62,"And mention the day when He God will call to them and say ‘Where then are My partners those whom you used to claim?’ were partners of Mine."
  28,63,"Those against whom the Word of punishment will have become due the justified Word that they be admitted into the Fire — and these are the leaders of misguidance — they shall say ‘Our Lord! These are the ones whom we led astray hā’ūlā’i’lladhīna aghwaynā is both a subject and an adjectival qualification. We led them astray aghwaynāhum the predicate thereof and they went astray even as we went astray — we did not compel them to follow error. We declare our innocence of them before You; it was not us that they worshipped’ mā ‘not’ is for negation; the direct object iyyānā ‘us’ precedes the verb ya‘budūna ‘they worshipped’ in order to concord with the end-rhyme of the verses."
  28,64,"And it shall be said ‘Call now to your associates!’ namely the idols you alleged to be partners of God. So they will call to them but they will not answer them their call and they the former will see they will sight the chastisement they will wish if only they had been guided! in this world they would not have seen it in the Hereafter."
  28,65,"And mention the day when He will call to them and say ‘What response did you give to those messengers who were sent?’ to you."
  28,66,"The tidings the news of deliverance contained in the response will be obscured to them on that day in other words they will not find any statement that might contain hope of deliverance for them; so they will not question one other about this and will fall silent."
  28,67,"But as for him who repents of idolatry and believes in the affirmation of God’s Oneness and acts righteously he observes the duties of religion maybe he will be among the successful those delivered according to God’s promise."
  28,68,"And your Lord creates whatever He will and chooses whatever He will. They the idolaters do not have the choice the right to choose anything. Glory be to God and exalted be He above what they associate above their idolatry."
  28,69,"And your Lord knows what their breasts conceal what their hearts keep secret of disbelief and otherwise and what they proclaim by their tongues of such things."
  28,70,"And He is God; there is no god except Him. To Him belongs all praise in the former namely the life of this world and in the latter Paradise. And to Him belongs the judgement the decree effective in the case of all things and to Him you will be returned through resurrection."
