tafsir[5]{c,v,t}:
  4,87,"God — there is no god except Him and by God He will surely gather you from your graves to on the Day of Resurrection whereof there is no doubt no uncertainty. And who is truer in statement in speech than God? that is no one is."
  4,88,"When a group retreated from Uhud people were at variance over their status. Some said ‘Let us slay them’ while others said ‘No!’ So the following was revealed What is wrong with you what is the matter with you that you have become two parties two groups regarding the hypocrites when God has overthrown them He has turned them back to disbelief for what they earned? in the way of disbelief and acts of disobedience. What do you desire to guide him whom God has sent astray? that is to count them among the guided the interrogative in both places is for disapproval. And he whom God sends astray you will never find for him a way a path to guidance."
  4,89,"They long they wish that you should disbelieve as they disbelieve so then you and they would be equal in unbelief; therefore do not take friends from among them associating with them even if they should outwardly manifest belief until they emigrate in the way of God a proper emigration that would confirm their belief; then if they turn away and remain upon their ways take them as captives and slay them wherever you find them; and do not take any of them as a patron to associate with or as a helper to assist you against your enemy."
  4,90,"Except those who attach themselves to who seek refuge with a people between whom and you there is a covenant a pledge of security for them and for whoever attaches himself to them in the manner of the Prophet’s s covenant with Hilāl b. ‘Uwaymir al-Aslamī; or those who come to you with their breasts constricted dejected about the prospect of fighting you being on the side of their people or fighting their people siding with you in other words those who come to you refraining from fighting either you or them then do not interfere with them neither taking them as captives nor slaying them this statement and what follows was abrogated by the ‘sword’ verse. Had God willed to give them sway over you He would have given them sway over you by strengthening their hearts so that assuredly they would have fought you but God did not will it and so He cast terror into their hearts. And so if they stay away from you and do not fight you and offer you peace reconciliation that is if they submit then God does not allow you any way against them He does not allow you a means to take them captive or to slay them."
  4,91,"You will find others desiring to have security from you by manifesting belief before you and security from their own people through unbelief when they return to them and these were the tribes of Asad and Ghatafān; yet whenever they are returned to sedition whenever they are summoned to idolatry they are overwhelmed by it falling into it in the worst of ways. So if they do not stay away from you by refraining from fighting you and do not offer you peace and do not restrain their hands from you then take them as captives and slay them wherever you come upon them wherever you find them; against them We have given you clear warrant a clear and manifest proof for you to slay them and capture them on account of their treachery."
