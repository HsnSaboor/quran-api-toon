tafsir[4]{c,v,t}:
  9,69,"You O hypocrites are like those before you who were far mightier than you and more abundant in wealth and children. They enjoyed their share their lot in this world. So you enjoy O hypocrites your share just as those before you enjoyed their share and you indulge in vain talk in falsehood and defamation of the Prophet s just as they indulged in vain talk. Those their works have become invalid in this world and in the Hereafter; and those they indeed are the losers."
  9,70,"Has not the tidings the tale of those before them reached them — the folk of Noah and ‘Ād the folk of Hūd and Thamūd the folk of Sālih and the folk of Abraham and the dwellers of Midian the folk of Shu‘ayb and the Deviant cities? the cities of the folk of Lot meaning its inhabitants. Their messengers brought them clear proofs with miracles but they denied them and so were destroyed. God would never have wronged them by punishing them for no sin on their part but they wronged themselves by committing sin."
  9,71,"And the believers both men and women are allies of one another; they enjoin decency and forbid indecency; they observe prayer and pay the alms and they obey God and His Messenger. Those God will have mercy on them. Truly God is Mighty nothing can prevent Him from fulfilling His promise and His threat; Wise He puts everything in its proper place."
  9,72,"God has promised the believers both men and women Gardens underneath which rivers flow to abide therein and blessed dwellings in the Gardens of Eden for residence and beatitude from God is greater is superior to all of that. That is the supreme triumph."
