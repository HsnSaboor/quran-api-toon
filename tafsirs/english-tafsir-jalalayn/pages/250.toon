Truly your Lord is forgiving to mankind despite their evil-doing for otherwise He would not have left a single creature on the face of it the earth; and truly your Lord is severe in retribution against those who disobey Him."
  13,7,"And those who disbelieve say ‘Why has not some sign been sent down upon him upon Muhammad (s) from his Lord!’ the like of the staff and the glowing hand or the she-camel. God exalted be He says You are only a warner one to threaten the disbelievers for it is not your duty to bring forth signs; and for every folk there is a guide a prophet to guide them to their Lord with the signs that He gives him and not what with they request."
  13,8,"God knows what every female bears of male or female one or more and otherwise and what the wombs reduce of the time of gestation and what they increase of it. And everything with Him is according to a precise measure a precise amount and limit which it does not exceed;"
  13,9,"He is the Knower of the unseen and the visible of what is hidden and what is witnessed; the Great the Tremendous the High Exalted above His creation through His overpowering subjugation read al-muta‘ālī or al-muta‘āl ‘the High Exalted’."
  13,10,"They are all the same according to His knowledge exalted be He those of you who speak secretly and those who do so openly and those who lurk who hide themselves in the night in its darkness and those who go forth those who are manifest to view when they make their way by day."
  13,11,"For him for man are attendants angels who follow him to his front and to his rear guarding him through God’s command that is by His command from the danger of the jinn and others. Indeed God does not alter the state of a people — He does not deprive them of His grace — unless they have altered the state of their souls from their comely nature through an act of disobedience. And if God wills misfortune chastisement for a people there is none that can repel it either from among the attendant angels or others; and they for whom God wills misfortune have no protector min wālin min is extra to avert it from them apart from Him that is other than God."

He unleashes the thunderbolts — these are a fire which issues forth from the clouds — and smites with them whom He will such that it burns that person this was revealed regarding a man to whom the Prophet s had sent someone to invite to Islam and who said ‘Who is the Messenger of God? And what is God? Is He made of gold or of silver or of copper?’ whereupon a thunderbolt came down on him and blew off the top of his head; yet they that is the disbelievers dispute argue with the Prophet s about God though He is great in might in power or in the severity of His retribution."
