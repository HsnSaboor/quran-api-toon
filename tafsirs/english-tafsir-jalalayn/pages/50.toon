  3,1,"Alif Lām Mīm God knows best what He means by these letters."
  3,2,"God! There is no god except Him the Living the Eternal."
  3,3,"He has revealed to you O Muhammad (s) the Book the Qur’ān enveloped by the truth with veracity in what it announces confirming what was before it of Books; and He revealed the Torah and the Gospel"
  3,4,"before that is to say before revealing it the Qur’ān as guidance hudan a circumstantial qualifier meaning hādiyīn ‘guides from error’ to people to those who followed these two Books He uses the word anzala for the revelation of these two and nazzala for that of the Qur’ān for the latter entails repetition whereas the two Books were revealed in one instance; and He revealed the Criterion al-furqān meaning the Scriptures that discriminate between truth and falsehood. He mentions this Criterion after He has mentioned the three Scriptures so that it encompasses all revealed Scriptures besides these. As for those who disbelieve in God’s signs the Qur’ān or any other revelation for them awaits a terrible chastisement; God is Mighty victorious in His affair so that nothing can prevent Him from effecting His promise and His threat; Lord of Retribution with a severe punishment for those that disobeyed Him the like of which none can do."
  3,5,"Nothing no existent thing whatever is hidden in heaven and earth from God on account of His knowledge of universals and particulars. God specifies them heaven and earth because sensory perception does not go beyond these."
  3,6,"He it is Who forms you in the wombs as He will as males or females white black or otherwise. There is no god except Him the Mighty in His Kingdom the Wise in His actions."
  3,7,"He it is Who revealed to you the Book wherein are verses that are clear lucid in proof forming the Mother Book the original basis for rulings and others allegorical whose meanings are not known such as the opening verses of some sūras. He God refers to the whole Qur’ān as 1 ‘clear’ muhkam where He says A Book whose verses have been made clear Q. 111 meaning that it contains no imperfections; and as 2 ‘allegorical’ mutashābih where He says A Book consimilar Q. 3923 meaning that its parts resemble each other in terms of beauty and veracity. As for those in whose hearts is deviation inclination away from truth they follow the allegorical part desiring sedition among the ignorant of them throwing them into specious arguments and confusion and desiring its interpretation its explanation and none knows its interpretation its explanation save God Him alone. And those firmly rooted established and capable in knowledge al-rāsikhūna fī’l-‘ilm is the subject the predicate of which is what follows say ‘We believe in it the allegorical part that it is from God and we do not know its meaning; all of the clear and the allegorical is from our Lord’; yet none remembers yadhdhakkar the initial tā’ of yatadhakkar has been assimilated with the dhāl that is none is admonished but people of pith possessors of intellect who when they see those following that allegorical part only also say"
  3,8,"Our Lord do not cause our hearts to deviate do not cause them to incline away from the truth in their desire to interpret it such as is inappropriate for us — as You caused the hearts of those others to deviate — after You have guided us after You have shown us the way to it; and give us mercy from You as a strengthening; You are the Bestower."
  3,9,"Our Lord You shall gather mankind for a day that is on a day of which there is no doubt no uncertainty that is the Day of Resurrection when You will requite them for their deeds as You had promised; verily God will not fail the tryst His promise of the Upraising there is a shift of address here from the second to the third person and these last words could constitute God’s speech. The purpose of their supplication in this way is to show that their concern is with the matter of the Hereafter and for this reason they ask God for adherence to the path of guidance in order to attain its reward. The two Shaykhs Bukhārī and Muslim reported that ‘Ā’isha may God be pleased with her said ‘The Messenger of God s recited this verse It is He Who revealed to you the Book wherein are verses clear to the end of the verse and said “When you see those pursuing the allegorical parts know that these are the ones God refers to in this verse so beware of them” ’. Al-Tabarānī reported in his al-Kabīr that Abū Mūsā al-Ash‘arī heard the Prophet s say ‘I fear nothing for my community except three faults’ and he mentioned that one of these would be when the Book is opened in front of them and the believer will desire to interpret it and yet none knows its interpretation save God; and those firmly rooted in knowledge say ‘We believe in it all is from our Lord; yet none remembers but people of pith’ Q. 37 end of the hadīth."
