  9,101,"And among those around you O inhabitants of Medina of the Bedouins there are hypocrites such as the tribes of Aslam Ashja‘ and Ghifār and among the townspeople of Medina there are also hypocrites who are obstinate in hypocrisy engrossed in it and persisting in it. You do not know them — an address to the Prophet s — but We know them and We shall chastise them twice by disgracing them or having them killed in this world and by way of punishment in the grave then they will be returned in the Hereafter to a terrible chastisement namely the Fire."
  9,102,"And there are others ākharūn is the subject another folk who have confessed their sins for having stayed behind i‘tarafū bi-dhunūbihim is an adjectival qualification of it the subject and the predicate is the following khalatū ‘amalan sālihan they have mixed a righteous deed that is their former participation in the struggle or the their confession of their sins or otherwise with another that was bad which is their having stayed behind. It may be that God will relent to them. Truly God is Forgiving Merciful this was revealed regarding Abū Lubāba and a group of men who tied themselves to the walls of the mosque after they heard what had been revealed regarding those who stayed behind; they swore that only the Prophet s would untie them which he did when this verse was revealed."
  9,103,"Take of their wealth some alms to purify them and to cleanse them thereby of their sins; he thus took a third of their wealth and gave it away as charity; and pray for them that is supplicate for them; truly your prayers are a comfort a mercy for them it is also said to mean reassurance for them that their repentance has been accepted. And God is Hearer Knower."
  9,104,"Do they not know that God is He Who accepts repentance from His servants and takes accepts the voluntary alms and that God is He Who is the Relenting to His servants by accepting their repentance and the Merciful? to them the interrogative is intended as an affirmative statement and is meant to incite them to offer repentance and charity."
  9,105,"And say to them or to people in general ‘Act as you will for God will surely see your actions and so will His Messenger and the believers and you will be returned through resurrection to the Knower of the unseen and the visible that is to God and He will tell you what you used to do’ and so requite you for it."
  9,106,"And there are others from among those who stayed behind who are deferred read murja’ūna or murjawna whose repentance is delayed to God’s command concerning them according to His will whether He chastises them by causing them to die without their having made any repentance or relents to them; and God is Knower of His creatures Wise in what He does with them. These others mentioned are the three who will be mentioned afterwards Murāra b. al-Rabī‘ Ka‘b b. Mālik and Hilāl b. Umayya. They stayed behind out of laziness and their inclination for peace and quiet not out of hypocrisy. Unlike the others however they did not excuse themselves before the Prophet s and so the matter regarding them was suspended for fifty days during which time people avoided them until it was later revealed that God had relented to them."
