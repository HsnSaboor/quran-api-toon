  48,16,"Say to those of the Bedouins mentioned who were left behind to test them ‘You shall be called against a people possessed of great might — these are said to have been the tribe of Banū Hanīfa the inhabitants of the region of al-Yamāma; but it is also said that these were the Persians and the Byzantines — you shall fight them tuqātilūnahum is a circumstancial qualifier referring to an implied future situation which constitutes that to which the ‘call’ will be made; or they will submit so that you will not have to fight. So if you obey the command to fight them God will give you a good reward; but if you turn away like you turned away before He will chastise you with a painful chastisement’."
  48,17,"There is no blame on the blind nor is there blame on the lame nor is there blame on the sick to refrain from participating in the struggle. And whoever obeys God and His Messenger He will admit him read yudkhilhu or nudkhilhu ‘We will admit him’ into gardens underneath which rivers flow; and whoever turns away him He will chastise read yu‘adhdhibhu or nu‘adhdhibhu ‘him We will chastise’ with a painful chastisement."
  48,18,"Verily God was pleased with the believers when they pledged allegiance to you at al-Hudaybiyya under the tree this was an acacia — they these believers numbered 1300 or more; he took an oath of allegiance from them that they would fight against Quraysh and not attempt to flee from death. And He God knew what was in their hearts of sincerity and loyalty so He sent down the spirit of Peace upon them and rewarded them with a near victory which was the conquest of Khaybar following their departure from al-Hudaybiyya"
  48,19,"and abundant spoils which they will capture from Khaybar and God is ever Mighty Wise that is to say He is ever possessed of such attributes."
  48,20,"God has promised you abundant spoils which you will capture through the various conquests. So He has expedited this one the spoils of Khaybar for you and withheld men’s hands from you with regard to your families after you had set off on the campaign as the Jews had intended to plot against them; but God cast terror into their hearts; so that it the expedited one wa-li-takūna is a supplement to an implied verb that is to say li-tashkurūhu ‘that you may give thanks to Him’ may be a sign for the believers of their being assisted by God and that He may guide you on a straight path that is to say the way in which you should rely on Him and entrust any affair to Him exalted be He;"
  48,21,"and others wa-ukhrā is an adjectival qualification of the implied subject maghānima ‘spoils’ which you were not able to capture — namely spoils from the Persians and the Byzantines; God has verily encompassed these already that is to say He knows that they will be yours. And God has power over all things that is to say He is ever possessed of such an attribute."
  48,22,"And if those who disbelieve had fought you at al-Hudaybiyya they would have turned their backs to flee — then they would not have found any protector to guard them or helper."
  48,23,"That is the way of God sunnata’Llāhi is a verbal noun emphasising the import of the preceding sentence about the defeat of the disbelievers and the victory of the believers that is to say sanna’Llāhu dhālika sunnatan ‘God has established this as His way of dealing with believers and disbelievers’ which has taken its course before and you will never find in God’s way any change by Him."
