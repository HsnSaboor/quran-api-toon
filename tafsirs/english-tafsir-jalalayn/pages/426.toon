tafsir[8]{c,v,t}:
  33,55,"They the Prophet’s wives would not be at fault with regard to socialising with their fathers or their sons or their brothers or their brothers’ sons or their sisters’ sons or their own believing women or what their right hands own of slavegirls or male servants in seeing them or conversing with them without a screen. And fear O women God in what you have been commanded. Surely God is Witness to all things with nothing being hidden from Him."
  33,56,"Indeed God and His angels bless the Prophet Muhammad (s). O you who believe invoke blessings on him and invoke peace upon him in a worthy manner in other words say ‘O God bless our master Muhammad and grant him peace’ Allāhumma sallī ‘alā sayyidinā Muhammad wa-sallim."
  33,57,"Indeed those who are injurious to God and His Messenger — and they are the disbelievers who attribute to God what He is exalted above of such things as His having a son or a partner and they deny His Messenger — God has cursed them in this world and the Hereafter He has banished them from His mercy and has prepared for them a humiliating chastisement and that is the Fire."
  33,58,"And those who cause hurt to believing men and believing women without the latter’s having done anything those who accuse them of what they have not done have verily borne the guilt of calumny they have borne lies and the burden of manifest sin."
  33,59,"O Prophet! Tell your wives and daughters and the women of the believers to draw their cloaks closely over themselves jalābīb is the plural of jilbāb which is a wrap that covers a woman totally — in other words let them pull part of it also over their faces leaving one eye visible when they need to leave the house for something. That makes it likelier that they will be known to be free women and not be molested by being approached. In contrast slavegirls did not use to cover their faces and so the disbelievers used to pester them. And God is Forgiving of any occasion in the past when they may have neglected to cover themselves Merciful to them in His veiling them."
  33,60,"If la-in the lām is for oaths the hypocrites do not desist from their hypocrisy and likewise those in whose hearts is a sickness in their urge to fornicate as well as the scaremongers in the city who alarm the believers by saying to them things like ‘Your enemy is here and your raiding parties have been massacred!’ or they say to them ‘They have been defeated!’. Assuredly We will urge you to take action against them We will give you sway over them then they will not be your neighbours they will not dwell near you in it except for a little while after which they will depart."
  33,61,"Accursed banished from mercy shall they be wherever they are found they shall be seized and slain violently that is to say that is the ruling concerning them — meant as a command for the Prophet."
  33,62,"God’s precedent in other words God has made this His precedent in dealing with those who passed away before with regard to the hypocrites of past communities who used to alarm believers with their scaremongery and you will find that there is no changing God’s precedent no changing of it from Him."
