tafsir[7]{c,v,t}:
  60,12,"O Prophet if believing women come to you pledging allegiance to you that they will not ascribe anything as partner to God and that they will not steal nor commit adultery nor slay their children as used to be done during the time of pagandom jāhiliyya when they would bury new-born girls alive fearing ignominy and impoverishment nor bring any lie that they have invented originating between their hands and their legs that is by bringing a foundling which they then falsely ascribe to the husband — it the lie is described in terms of a real child because when a woman gives birth to a child it falls between her hands and legs; nor disobey you in doing what is decent which is that which concords with obedience to God such as refraining from wailing ripping apart their clothes in grief pulling out their hair tearing open the front of their garments or scratching their faces then accept their allegiance — the Prophet s did this but in words and he did not shake hands with any of them — and ask God to forgive them; surely God is Forgiving Merciful."
  60,13,"O you who believe do not befriend a people against whom God is wrathful namely the Jews. They have truly despaired of the Hereafter of attaining its reward — despite their being certain of its truth out of obstinacy towards the Prophet even though they know him to be sincere — just as the disbelievers have despaired — they themselves being — of those who are in the tombs that is to say those who are entombed and barred from the good of the Hereafter for they are shown both their would-have-been places in Paradise had they believed and the Fire for which they are destined."
  61,1,"All that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth glorifies God that is to say everything proclaims His transcendence the lām of li’Llāhi is extra and mā has been used instead of min in order to indicate the predominance of non-rational creatures and He is the Mighty in His kingdom the Wise in His actions."
  61,2,"O you who believe why do you say in demanding to participate in the struggle what you do not do? for you retreated at Uhud."
  61,3,"It is greatly loathsome maqtan is for specification to God that you say an taqūlū constitutes the agent of the verb kabura ‘it is greatly’ what you do not do."
  61,4,"Indeed God loves He assists and honours those who fight for His cause in ranks saffan is a circumstantial qualifier in other words understand it as sāffīna as if they were a solid structure with all of its parts compacted together firm."
  61,5,"And mention when Moses said to his people ‘O my people why do you harm me — for they had said that he had a hernia in his testicles which he did not have and they denied him — when certainly qad is for confirmation you know that I am the messenger of God to you?’ annī rasūlu’Llāhi ilaykum this sentence is a circumstantial qualifier and when you know that messengers ought to be respected. So when they deviated when they swerved away from the truth by harming him God caused their hearts to deviate He turned them away from guidance in accordance to what He had preordained since pre-eternity and God does not guide the immoral folk those who in His knowledge are disbelievers."
