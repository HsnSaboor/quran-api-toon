tafsir[8]{c,v,t}:
  3,166,"And what afflicted you the day the two hosts encountered at Uhud was by God’s leave by His will and that He might know through knowledge manifested outwardly the true believers."
  3,167,"And that He might also know the hypocrites and those who when it was said to them after they had fled the fighting namely ‘Abd Allāh b. Ubayy and his companions ‘Come now fight in the way of God His enemies or defend’ us against the enemy by increasing the multitude of our fighters if you are not going to fight; they said ‘If we knew how if we were skilled enough to fight we would follow you’. God then said showing them to be liars They that day were nearer to unbelief than to belief for what they manifested of their forsaking the believers whereas before they had been outwardly nearer to belief; saying with their mouths that which was not in their hearts for even if they had known how to fight they would not have followed you. And God knows best what they hide of hypocrisy."
  3,168,"Those who alladhīna substitutes for the previous alladhīna or constitutes an adjectival qualification of it said to their brothers in religion whilst they themselves had stayed put refraining from joining the struggle ‘Had they the martyrs at Uhud or those who stayed put with us obeyed us they would not have been slain’. Say to them ‘Then avert ward off death from yourselves if you speak the truth’ in that staying put delivers one from it sc. from death."
  3,169,"The following was revealed regarding martyrs Count not those who were slain read qutilū or quttilū in God’s way that is for the sake of His religion as dead but rather that they are living with their Lord their spirits inside green birds that take wing freely wherever they wish in Paradise as reported in a hadīth; provided for by Him with the fruits of Paradise."
  3,170,"Rejoicing farihīna a circumstantial qualifier referring to the person governing yurzaqūn ‘sustained’ in what God has given them of His bounty and they are rejoicing joyful for the sake of those who have not joined them but are left behind from among their believing brothers allādhīna ‘those who’ may be substituted by what follows sc. ‘rejoicing…that no fear’ that no fear shall befall them those that have not yet joined them neither shall they grieve in the Hereafter meaning they rejoice for their brothers’ future security and felicity allā of allā khawfun is an-lā meaning bi-an lā."
  3,171,"Joyful in grace in the reward and bounty in addition to it from God and that read wa-anna as a supplement to ni‘matin or wa-inna to denote a new clause God does not let the wage of believers go to waste but rewards them."
  3,172,"Those who alladhīna is the subject responded to God and the Messenger to his call to set out for battle when Abū Sufyān and his companions wanted to resume hostilities they agreed with the Prophet s that the encounter would be at the annual market-fair of Badr a year from the date of Uhud; after the wounds had afflicted them at Uhud — the predicate of the subject alladhīna is what follows for all those who were virtuous by obeying him and feared to disobey him shall be a great wage namely Paradise."
  3,173,"Those to whom alladhīna substitutes for the previous alladhīna ‘those who’ or an adjectival qualification of it people that is Nu‘aym b. Mas‘ūd al-Ashja‘ī said ‘The people Abū Sufyān and his companions have gathered their multitudes against you in order to exterminate you therefore fear them’ and do not go out to encounter them; but that saying increased them in faith in their belief in God and in certainty and they said ‘God is sufficient for us He will deal fully for us with their affair; an excellent Guardian is He’  the One to whom the matter is entrusted. They thus set out with the Prophet s and arrived at the market-fair of Badr but God had cast terror into the hearts of Abū Sufyān and his followers and so they did not turn up. They the believers had merchandise with them and so they traded and made profits. God exalted be He says"
