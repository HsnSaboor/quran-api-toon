tafsir[7]{c,v,t}:
  62,9,"O you who believe when the call for prayer is made on Friday hasten set off to the remembrance of God to the prayer and leave aside all commerce suspend all such contracts. That is better for you should you know that it is better for you then do it."
  62,10,"And when the prayer is finished disperse in the land this is an imperative denoting permissibility and seek provision through God’s bounty and remember God with remembrance frequently that perhaps you may be successful that perhaps you may be the winners."
  62,11,"On one occasion the Prophet s was delivering the Friday sermon when a caravan arrived and so as was the custom drums were beaten to announce its arrival whereat the people began to leave the mosque to go to it all except for twelve men. The following verse was then revealed But when they sight some opportunity for business or a diversion they scatter off towards it that is towards the business since it is what they seek more than diversion and leave you during the sermon standing. Say ‘That which is with God in the way of reward is better for those who believe than diversion and commerce. And God is the best of providers’. They say that every person ‘provides for’ yarzuqu his dependants by which they mean that such a person does so by means of the provision given by God min rizqi’Llāhi exalted be He."
  63,1,"When the hypocrites come to you they say with their tongues in contradiction of what is in their hearts ‘We bear witness that you are indeed the Messenger of God.’ And God knows that you are indeed His Messenger and God bears witness He knows that the hypocrites truly are liars in what they conceal that which is contrary to what they say."
  63,2,"They have taken their oaths as a shield as a means of protection for their possessions and their lives and so they have barred thereby from the way of God that is from using them for the struggle. Evil indeed is that which they are wont to do."
  63,3,"That namely their evil deed is because they believed by affirming faith only with the tongue then disbelieved in their hearts that is to say they persist in harbouring disbelief in it; therefore their hearts have been stamped sealed with disbelief. Hence they do not understand faith."
  63,4,"And when you see them their figures please you on account of their fairness; and if they speak you listen to their speech because of its eloquence. Yet they are by virtue of the enormous size of their figures yet in their lack of comprehension like blocks of timber read khushbun or khushubun that have been propped-up set reclining against a wall. They assume that every cry made like a battle-cry or one made to retrieve a lost camel is directed against them because of the extent of terror in their hearts lest something should be revealed deeming their blood licit. They are the enemy so beware of them for they communicate your secrets to the disbelievers. May God assail them! destroy them! How can they deviate? how can they be turned away from faith after the proofs for it have been established?"
