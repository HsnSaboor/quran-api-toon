  3,141,"And that God may prove the believers purifying them of sins through what befalls them and efface that is destroy the disbelievers."
  3,142,"Or nay did you suppose you should enter Paradise without God knowing through knowledge manifested outwardly who among you have struggled and who are patient in times of hardship?"
  3,143,"You were longing for tamannawna one of the two letters tā’ has been omitted from the original tatamannawna death before you met it when you said ‘Would that we had a day like the Day of Badr in order to attain what its martyrs attained.’ Now you have seen it that is the cause of it war looking on that is with your eyes open and contemplating the conditions so why did you retreat?"
  3,144,"With regard to their being routed when it was rumoured that the Prophet had been killed and the hypocrites had said to the believers ‘If he has been killed go back to your previous religion’ the following was revealed Muhammad is only a messenger; messengers have passed away before him. Why if he should die or is slain like others will you turn back on your heels will you return to unbelief the last statement is the locus of the interrogative of denial in other words ‘he was not a worshipped being so that if he were to die you should turn back to your previous religion’. If any man should turn back on his heels he will not harm God in any way but will be harming himself and God will requite those that are thankful for His graces by staying firm."
  3,145,"It is not for any soul to die save by the leave of God by His decree a prescribed kitāban here a verbal noun that is God has prescribed this term that is to say a term fixed in time neither brought forward nor deferred so why did you retreat in defeat? Defeat does not ward off death nor does standing one’s ground sever life. And whoever desires by his deeds the reward of this world that is his requital in it We will give him of it what has been alloted to him but he shall have no share in the Hereafter; and whoever desires the reward of the Hereafter We will give him of it that is of its reward; and We will requite the thankful."

And God loves the patient during trials meaning that He will reward them."
  3,147,"All that they said when their prophet had been killed while they stood their ground and were steadfast was ‘Our Lord forgive us our sins and our excesses our overstepping the bounds in our affairs a declaration of the fact that what had befallen them was the result of their evil actions and a humbling of their selves and make firm our feet with strength for the struggle and help us against the unbelieving folk’."
  3,148,"And God gave them the reward of this world victory and booty and the fairest reward of the Hereafter that is Paradise husnuhu ‘the fairest of it’ denotes extra favour in addition to what is deserved; and God loves the virtuous."
