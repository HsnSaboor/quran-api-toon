  3,30,"And remember the day every soul shall find what it has done of good present before it and what it has done of evil the last statement constitutes the subject the predicate of which is what follows it will wish that between it and that there were a great distance an extremely lengthy distance so that it the evil could never reach it. God warns you of His Self this is repeated for emphasis and God is Kind to His servants."
  3,31,"When they said ‘We only worship idols out of our love for God that they might bring us close to Him’ the following was revealed Say O Muhammad (s) ‘If you love God follow me and God will love you meaning that He will reward you and forgive you your sins; God is Forgiving as regards the sins committed previously by one who now follows me; Merciful to him."
  3,32,"Say to them ‘Obey God and the Messenger’ as regards the belief in the Oneness of God which he enjoins upon you. But if they turn their backs if they object to obedience God loves not the disbelievers meaning that He will chastise them the third person pronominalisation ‘they’ is replaced by the overt noun ‘the disbelievers’."
  3,33,"Lo! God preferred He has chosen Adam and Noah and the House of Abraham and the House of ‘Imrān meaning He preferred their selves sc. Abraham and ‘Imrān above the worlds by making prophethood reside in them and their progeny"
  3,34,"the seed of one offspring from another of them; God is Hearer Knower."
  3,35,"Mention when the wife of ‘Imrān Hanna said after she had reached old age and longed for a child and supplicated to God and sensed that she was carrying child ‘O Lord I have vowed to offer You what is within my womb as a consecration one liberated and delivered from the distractions of this world for the service of Your Holy House in Jerusalem. Accept this from me. Lo! It is You Who are the Hearer of petition the Knower of intentions. ‘Imrān died while she was still pregnant."
  3,36,"And when she gave birth to her a girl and she had been hoping for a boy since only males were consecrated to the service of God she said apologetically ‘O Lord I have given birth to a female’ — and God knew very well what she had given birth to a parenthetical statement constituting God’s speech a variant reading for wada‘at ‘she gave birth’ has wada‘tu ‘I gave birth’ making these Hanna’s words sc. ‘and God knows very well what I have given birth to’; the male that she had asked for is not as the female that was bestowed upon her because he is designed for the service of God while she would not be suitable on account of her lesser physical ability her private parts the effects of menstruation on her and so on. ‘And I have named her Mary and commend her to You with her seed her children to protect them from the accursed the outcast Satan’. In a hadīth it is stated ‘Every new-born is touched by Satan and begins life by crying except for Mary and her son’ as reported by the two Shaykhs Bukhārī and Muslim."
  3,37,"Her Lord accepted the child that is He received Mary from her mother with gracious acceptance and made her grow excellently He made her grow up with excellent character. She would grow in a day by as much as a new-born grew during a year. Her mother took her to the priests the keepers of the Holy House of Jerusalem and said ‘This here before you is the dedication I offered’. They competed for guardianship of her because she was the daughter of their religious leader at which point Zachariah said ‘I am most worthy of her for her maternal aunt lives with me’. The others said ‘No not until we have cast lots’. Thus all twenty nine of them departed to the River Jordan where they cast their quills agreeing that the one whose quill remained fast and floated to the surface of the water would be most worthy of being guardian over her. Zachariah’s quill remained fast and surfaced. He took charge of her and built for her a gallery-room with a ladder in the temple and none apart from him went up to her. He used to bring her food drink and oil and would find her with summer fruits in winter and winter fruits in summer just as God says and Zachariah took charge of her he took her to him a variant reading of kafalahā ‘he took charge of her’ is kaffalahā ‘He God gave Zachariah charge of her’ with Zakariyyā’ or Zakariyyā in the accusative and ‘God’ as the subject of the verb. Whenever Zachariah went into the sanctuary that is the room the most noble seat in the temple where she was he found her with provisions. ‘O Mary’ he said ‘Whence comes this to you?’ She still very young said ‘From God He sends it to me from Paradise’ ‘Truly God provides abundant provision for whomever He will without reckoning’ without consequence."
