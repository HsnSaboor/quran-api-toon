tafsir[7]{c,v,t}:
  42,16,"And those who argue with the Prophet concerning the religion of God after His call has been answered through faith on account of His miracle having been manifested — and they are the Jews — their argument stands refuted is invalid with their Lord and His wrath shall be upon them and there will be a severe chastisement for them."
  42,17,"God it is Who has revealed the Book the Qur’ān with the truth bi’l-haqqi is semantically connected to anzala ‘revealed’ as well as the Balance Justice. And what do you know — perhaps the Hour that is its arrival is near! la‘alla ‘perhaps’ comments on the verb describing the action with what follows it functioning as two direct objects."
  42,18,"Those who do not believe in it seek to hasten it they say ‘When will it come?’ as a presumption on their part that it will never come; but those who believe are apprehensive of it and know that it is the truth. Nay but verily those who are in doubt those who argue concerning the Hour are indeed in extreme error!"
  42,19,"God is Gracious to His servants both the pious and the profligate for He does not destroy them through hunger despite their acts of disobedience. He provides for whomever He will from among each of the two classes of individuals whatever He will. And He is the Strong in effecting what He wants the Mighty Whose way always prevails."
  42,20,"And whoever desires in return for his actions the harvest of the Hereafter in other words its gains and that is reward We will enhance for him his harvest by multiplying in it the good deed up tenfold or more; and whoever desires the harvest of this world We will give him of it without multiplying any of it giving him only what is his preordained share; but in the Hereafter he will have no share."
  42,21,"Or have they the Meccan disbelievers associates — these being their devils — who have prescribed for them for the disbelievers a religion a corrupt religion which God has not given permission for? such as idolatry and denial of resurrection? And were it not for a prior decisive word in other words a prior decree to the effect that requital will take place on the Day of Resurrection it would have been judged between them and the believers by chastising the former in this world. Truly the wrongdoers the disbelievers will have a painful chastisement."
  42,22,"You will see the wrongdoers on the Day of Resurrection apprehensive because of what they had earned in this world in the way of evil deeds lest they be requited for these; and it that is the requital for these deeds will surely befall them on the Day of Resurrection inevitably; but those who believe and perform righteous deeds will be in the lushest Gardens in other words in the best of these Gardens in comparison with the other ones. They will have whatever they wish near their Lord; that is the great favour."
