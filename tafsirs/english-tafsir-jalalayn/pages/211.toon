tafsir[5]{c,v,t}:
  10,21,"And when We made people that is the disbelievers of Mecca taste of mercy of rain and fertility after adversity misery and drought that had afflicted them behold! they have some plot concerning Our signs in the way of mockery and denial. Say to them ‘God is swifter at plotting at requiting; surely Our guardian messengers are writing down that which you are plotting’ tamkurūn is also read yamkurūn ‘they are plotting’."
  10,22,"He it is Who conveys you yusayyirukum a variant reading has yanshurukum across the land and the sea until when you are in ships and they sail with them there is a shift of address from second to third person with a fair gentle breeze and they rejoice therein there comes upon them a stormy wind blowing violently destroying everything and waves come on them from every side and they think that they are overwhelmed that is that they shall perish they call upon God secure in their faith their supplication only to Him ‘If la-in the lām is for oaths You deliver us from these terrors we shall verily be of the thankful’ of those who affirm Your Oneness."
  10,23,"Yet when He has delivered them behold! they are insolent in the earth wrongfully by associating others with God. O mankind your insolence wrongdoing is only against yourselves since the sin thereof shall fall against them; it is but the enjoyment of the life of this world which you will enjoy for a short while then to Us is your return after death and We shall inform you of what you used to do and then requite you for it a variant reading for nominative matā‘u has accusative matā‘a ‘an enjoyment’ in other words read as with an omitted verb such as tatamatta‘ūna ‘one which you shall enjoy’."
  10,24,"The likeness the description of the life of this world is only as water rain which We send down from the heaven then the plants of the earth mingle with it they mingle because of it attaching themselves one to another whereof mankind eat plants such as wheat and barley and so on and cattle eat of pasture until when the earth has taken on its ornaments its splendour of plants and has adorned itself with flowers izzayyanat ‘adorned itself’ is originally tazayyanat but the tā’ has been substituted with the zāy and assimilated with it and its inhabitants think that they are masters of it fully capable of harvesting its fruits Our command Our decree or Our chastisement comes upon it by night or day and We make it that is its crops as reaped corn like that which has been reaped with sickles as though ka-an is softened in other words read it as ka-annahā the previous day it had not flourished as though it never were. Thus do We detail do We make clear the signs for a people who reflect."
  10,25,"And God summons to the Abode of Peace that is the Abode of security which is Paradise by summoning people to faith and He guides whomever He wills that he be guided to a straight path the religion of Islam."
