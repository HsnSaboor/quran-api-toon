  4,38,"And those wa’lladhīna a supplement to the previous alladhīna ‘those’ who expend of their substance to show off to people to be seen of them and believe not in God and the Last Day the likes of the hypocrites and the Meccans. Whoever has Satan for a comrade for a companion whose command he follows as these do then an evil comrade has he."
  4,39,"And what burden is on them if they were to believe in God and the Last Day and expend of what God has provided them? that is to say what harm would this cause them? In other words there is no harm therein. Rather harm lies in what they follow the interrogative is meant as a disavowal; the law of law āmanū ‘if they were to believe’ conveys the sense of the verbal noun sc. mādhā ‘alayhim īmānuhum ‘what burden would their belief be upon them?’. God is ever Aware of them and will requite them for what they have done."
  4,40,"Surely God shall not wrong anyone so much as the weight of an atom the weight of the smallest ant by diminishing thereby a person’s good deeds or increase thereby his evil deeds; and if it the atom be a good deed in taku hasanatan ‘if it be a good deed’ is also read in taku hasanatun in which case the kāna construction is syntactically complete from a believer He will double it yudā‘ifuhā also read yuda‘‘ifuhā from ten times up to more than seven hundred times and give from Himself in addition to the doubling a great wage that no one can estimate."
  4,41,"So how shall it be the predicament of the disbelievers when We bring forward from every community a witness to testify against it regarding its deeds and this shall be its prophet; and We bring you O Muhammad (s) as witness against these?"
  4,42,"Upon that day the day of bringing forward; the disbelievers those who have disobeyed the Messenger will wish that law ‘if’ means an ‘that’ the earth might be levelled with them read passive tusawwā or active tasawwā or tassawwā so that like it they might also become dust and this is because of the terror of that day as is stated in another verse The disbeliever shall say ‘O would that I were dust!’ Q. 7840. And they will not hide from God any talk of what they did although at another stage they do actually hide it and say ‘By God our Lord we never associated anything with You’ Q. 623."
  4,43,"O you who believe draw not near to prayer that is do not perform prayer whilst you are inebriated by a drink this was revealed concerning being drunk during the congregational prayer; until you know what you are saying when you have sobered up; nor whilst you are defiled as a result of sexual penetration or ejaculation junuban ‘defiled’ is in the accusative because it is a circumstantial qualifier and may be used to refer to the singular or plural — unless you are traversing crossing a way a route that is unless you are travelling — until you have washed yourselves in which case you may perform prayer a proviso is made for the traveller because a different stipulation applies to him as will follow. It is said that the purpose of this verse is to prohibit the approach to places of prayer that is mosques the exception being if one were merely passing through and not staying. But if you are sick with an illness made worse by contact with water or on a journey that is or travelling whilst you are ritually defiled or impure or if any of you comes from the privy al-ghā’it a place designated for relieving nature that is to say or if any of you have defecated or you have touched women lāmastum a variant reading has lamastum both mean lams that is ‘touching with the hand’ as stated by Ibn ‘Umar; this is also the opinion of al-Shāfi‘ī and it extends to touching with other parts of the skin; according to Ibn ‘Abbās however it is referring to sexual intercourse; and you can find no water with which to purify yourselves for prayer having made the effort to seek it out and search for it — the sick being exempt in this case — then resort to seek when the time for the prayer has commenced wholesome soil clean earth strike it twice and wipe your faces and your hands with it up to the elbows the verb masaha ‘to wipe’ may stand on its own with a direct object or take a particle before the direct object sc. masaha bi-. God is ever Pardoning Forgiving."
  4,44,"Have you not seen those who were given a share a portion of the Book namely the Jews purchasing error with guidance and desiring that you should err from the way? that you should stray from the path of truth and be like them."
