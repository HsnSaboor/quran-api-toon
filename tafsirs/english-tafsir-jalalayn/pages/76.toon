tafsir[6]{c,v,t}:
  3,195,"And their Lord answers them their supplication by saying that ‘I do not let the labour of any labourer among you go to waste be you male or female — the one of you is as the other this statement is a reaffirmation of the previous one that is they are both equal when it comes to recompensing them for their deeds and for not neglecting them. When Umm Salama asked ‘O Messenger of God why is there no mention of women when it comes to the Emigration hijra?’ the following was revealed and those who emigrated from Mecca to Medina and were expelled from their habitations those who suffered hurt in My way for My religion and fought the disbelievers and were slain read qutilū or quttilū — them I shall surely absolve of their evil deeds concealing these with forgiveness and I shall admit them to Gardens underneath which river flow’. A reward thawāban is a verbal noun reaffirming the import of la-ukaffiranna from God! there is a shift of person here. And God — with Him is the fairest reward the fairest requital."
  3,196,"When the Muslims began to say ‘Look at the enemies of God how comfortable they are while we are struggling!’ the following was revealed Let it not delude you that the disbelievers go to and fro in the land engaging in commerce and acquiring profit"
  3,197,"That is but a little enjoyment which they enjoy for a short while in this world and then perishes; then their abode is Hell — an evil cradling an evil resting place it is!"
  3,198,"But those who fear their Lord — for them shall be Gardens underneath which rivers flow abiding that is it is decreed for them to abide therein; a hospitality nuzul is what is prepared for a guest; it is in the accusative nuzulan because it is a circumstantial qualifier referring to jannāt ‘gardens’ and its operator is the import of the adverbial phrase from God Himself. That which is with God in the way of reward is better for the pious than the enjoyment of this world."
  3,199,"Verily there are some among the People of the Scripture who believe in God like ‘Abd Allāh b. Salām and his companions and the Negus and what has been revealed to you that is the Qur’ān and what has been revealed to them that is the Torah and the Gospel humble before God khāshi‘īn is a circumstantial qualification of the person of the verb yu’min ‘who believe’ and takes into account the potentially plural sense of man ‘who’ not purchasing with the verses of God which they have before them in the Torah and the Gospel pertaining to the descriptions of the Prophet s a small price of this world by concealing them for fear of losing their supremacy as others like the Jews have done. Those — their wage the reward for their deeds is with their Lord a reward which they will be given twice over as stated in the sūrat al-Qasas Q. 2854. God is swift at reckoning reckoning with the whole of creation in about half a day of the days of this world."
  3,200,"O you who believe be patient in performing acts of obedience in the face of afflictions and in refraining from acts of disobedience and vie in patience with the disbelievers lest they be more patient than you; be steadfast persist in the struggle; fear God in all of your circumstances so that you will prosper so that you will win admittance to Paradise and be delivered from the Fire."
