  6,74,"And mention when Abraham said to his father Āzar which was his cognomen his first name being Terah Tārikh ‘Do you take idols as gods to worship? an interrogative meant as a rebuke. I see you and your people by this act of taking them as gods in manifest error’ far from the truth."
  6,75,"And so just as We show him the misguidance of his father and his people We show Abraham the kingdom of the heavens and the earth that he might infer thereby the truth of Our Oneness and that he might be of those knowing it with certainty the sentence beginning with wa-kadhālika ‘and so’ and what follows it is a parenthetical statement and a supplement to the one beginning with qāla ‘he said’."
  6,76,"When night descended when it darkened upon him he saw a star — said to have been Venus — and said to his people who were astrologers ‘This is my Lord’ as you are wont to claim. But when it set when it disappeared he said ‘I love not those that set’ to take them as lords because it is not possible for a true Lord to be transformed or to change place as such attributes pertain to accidents — but this had no effect on them."
  6,77,"And when he saw the moon rising appearing he said to them ‘This is my Lord.’ But when it set he said ‘Unless my Lord guides me unless He establishes me within true guidance I shall surely become one of the folk who are astray’ — an intimation to his people that they are astray but still this had no effect on them."
  6,78,"And when he saw the sun rising he said ‘This is my Lord; this is greater!’ than the star and the moon the masculine demonstrative pronoun hādhā ‘this’ is used for the feminine shams ‘sun’ because the predicate rabbī ‘my Lord’ is masculine. But when it set and the argument against them had become stronger and they still had not repented he said ‘O my people surely I am innocent of what you associate with God in the way of idols and accidental bodies which require an originator. They then asked him ‘What do you worship?’"
  6,79,"He said Verily I have turned my face to I am seeking in worship Him Who originated created the heavens and the earth namely God; a hanīf inclining towards the upright religion and I am not of those that associate others’ with Him."
  6,80,"But his people disputed with him they argued with him about his religion and threatened him that the idols would strike him with evil if he abandoned them. He said ‘Do you dispute with me read a-tuhājjūnnī or a-tuhājūnī where one of the two letters nūn is omitted the nūn which grammarians refer to as nūn al-raf‘ ‘the nūn of modal independence’ and which the Qur’ānic reciters refer to as nūn al-wiqāya ‘the nūn of preservation’; do you argue with me concerning the Oneness of God when He exalted be He has guided me to it? I have no fear of what you associate with Him in the way of idols that they might strike me with some evil since they have no power to do anything unless my Lord wills something harmful to befall me and it does. My Lord encompasses all things through His knowledge; will you not remember this and believe?"
  6,81,"How should I fear what you have associated with God when it can neither profit nor harm and you fear not God in that you have associated with God in worship that for which He has not revealed to you any warrant?’ any argument or proof when He has power over all things. Which of the two parties has more right to security is it us or you if you have any knowledge of who has more right? In other words it is us so follow Him. God exalted be He says"
