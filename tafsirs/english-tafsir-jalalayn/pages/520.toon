  50,36,"And how many a generation We destroyed before them that is before the disbelievers of Quraysh We destroyed many generations of disbelievers who were mightier than these in prowess and who then searched throughout the land wondering is there any escape? for them and others from death but they found none."
  50,37,"Assuredly there is in that which is mentioned a reminder an admonition for him who has a heart a mind or gives ear or listens to admonitions in full witness present in heart and mind."
  50,38,"And verily We created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them in six days the first of which was Sunday and the last of which was Friday and no weariness no fatigue touched Us this was revealed as a refutation of the Jews’ claim that God rested on the Saturday and lay down upon the Throne. The preclusion of weariness in His case is absolute on account of His transcending of the attributes of creatures and the non-existence of any contiguity between Him and other beings His command when He wills a thing is just to say to it ‘Be’ and it is Q. 3682."
  50,39,"So endure patiently addressing the Prophet s what they the Jews and others say in the way of anthropomorphic comparisons and denials and glorify with praise of your Lord perform prayers with praise of Him before the rising of the sun in other words perform the morning prayer and before the sunset that is to say perform both the midday and the afternoon prayers;"
  50,40,"and glorify Him at some part of the night that is to say perform the two evening prayers and after prostrations read adbār as the plural of dubur or idbār as the verbal noun from adbara ‘to pass’ in other words perform supererogatory prayers as prescribed by the Sunna after the obligatory ones; it is also said to mean the actual uttering of glorifications at these times with continuous praise."
  50,41,"And listen — O addressee to My words — on the day when the caller namely the archangel Isrāfīl calls out from a place that is near to the heaven this is the Rock of the Holy House of Jerusalem the place on earth that is the nearest to the heaven. He Isrāfīl will say ‘O withered bones severed limbs torn flesh and scattered hairs! God verily commands you to come together for the passing of judgement’."
  50,42,"On the day yawma substitutes for the previous yawma when they that is all creatures hear the Call of truth of the Resurrection — this will be Isrāfīl’s second blast and it may precede or follow his initial call — that day of the call and the hearing is the day of coming forth from the graves yawma ‘on the day is in the accusative because of an implied yunādī ‘when he will call’ that is to say they will come to know the consequence of their denial."

  50,44,"On the day when yawma substitutes for the previous yawma with the intervening statement being a parenthetical the earth is split asunder read tashaqqaqu or tashshaqqaqu where the original second tā’ of tatashaqqaqu has been assimilated with it the shīn from them they will come hastening forth sirā‘an sirā‘ the plural of sarī‘ a circumstantial qualifier referring to an implied clause that is to say together they would read fa-yakhrujūna musri‘īna ‘they come forth hastening’. That is an easy gathering for Us dhālika hashrun ‘alaynā yasīr there is here a separation of the noun from its adjective by what is semantically connected to it for the purpose of specification — which is rhetorically unobjectionable; dhālika ‘that’ is meant to point out the signification of the ‘gathering’ which itself is also predicated by this demonstrative particle and this signification is the bringing back to life after extinction and the assembly for the exposition and the reckoning before God."
  50,45,"We know best what they the disbelievers of the Quraysh say and you are not to be a coercer of them so as to coerce them to embrace faith — but this was revealed before the command to struggle against these disbelievers. So admonish by the Qur’ān those who fear My threat namely believers."

  51,4,"and those that apportion by command the angels who distribute provisions and the rains and other things across the lands and to all servants"
  51,5,"assuredly what you are promised mā ‘what’ relates to the verbal action in other words the promise given to them of resurrection and other matters is true is indeed a true promise"
