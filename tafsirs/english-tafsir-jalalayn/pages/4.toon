  2,17,"Their likeness the way they are in their hypocrisy is as the likeness of one who kindled that is one who lit a fire in darkness and when it illumined all about him so that he is able to see and to feel warm and secure from those he feared God took away their light extinguishing it the plural pronoun in nūrihim takes into account the plural import of alladhī; and left them in darkness unable to see what is around them confused as to the way in fear; likewise are those who have found temporary security by professing faith but who will meet with terror and punishment upon death; these last are"
  2,18,"deaf to the truth so that they cannot hear it and accept it; dumb mute as regards goodness unable to speak of it; and blind to the path of guidance so that they cannot perceive it; they shall not return from error."
  2,19,"Or the likeness of them is as a cloudburst that is the likeness of them is as people are during rain ka-sayyib the term is originally sayyūb from the verb sāba yasūbu meaning ‘it came down’; out of the heaven out of the clouds in which clouds is darkness layer upon layer and thunder the angel in charge of them sc. the clouds; it is also said that this thunder is actually the sound of his voice; and lightning the flash caused by his voice which he uses to drive them — they the people under the rain put their fingers that is their fingertips in their ears against because of the thunderclaps the violent sound of thunder in order not to hear it cautious of fearful of death if they were to hear it. Similar is the case with these when the Qur’ān is revealed in which there is mention of the unbelief that is like darkness the threat of punishment that is like the sound of thunder and the clear arguments that are like the clear lightning they shut their ears in order not to hear it and thereby incline towards true faith and abandon their religion which for them would be death; and God encompasses the disbelievers in both knowledge and power so they cannot escape Him."
  2,20,"The lightning well-nigh almost snatches away their sight that is takes it away swiftly; whensoever it gives them light they walk in it in its light; and when the darkness is over them they stop that is they stand still a simile of the perturbation that the Qur’ānic arguments cause in their hearts and of their acknowledging the truths of what they love to hear and recoiling from what they detest; had God willed He would have taken away their hearing and their sight that is the exterior faculty in the same way that He took away their inner one; Truly God has power over all things that He wills as for example His taking away of the above-mentioned."
  2,21,"O people of Mecca worship profess the oneness of your Lord Who created you made you when you were nothing and created those that were before you; so that you may be fearful of His punishment by worshipping Him la‘alla ‘so that’ is essentially an optative but when spoken by God it denotes an affirmative"
  2,22,"He Who assigned to you created for you the earth for a couch like a carpet that is laid out neither extremely hard nor extremely soft so as to make it impossible to stand firm upon it; and heaven for an edifice like a roof; and sent down from the heaven water wherewith He brought forth all types of fruits for your provision; so set not up compeers to God that is partners in worship while you know that He is the Creator that you create not and that only One that creates can be God."
  2,23,"And if you are in doubt in uncertainty concerning what We have revealed to Our servant Muhammad (s) of the Qur’ān that it is from God then bring a sūra like it that is also revealed min mithlihi min is explicative that is a sūra like it in its eloquence fine arrangement and its bestowal of knowledge of the Unseen; a sūra is a passage with a beginning and end made up of a minimum of three verses; and call your witnesses those other gods that you worship besides God that is other than Him so that it can be seen if you are truthful in your claim that Muhammad (s) speaks it from himself. So do this for you are also fluent speakers of Arabic like him. When they could not do this God said"
  2,24,"And if you do not do what was mentioned because you are incapable and you will not a parenthetical statement that is never will you be able to because of its inimitability then fear through belief in God and belief that this is not the words of a human the Fire whose fuel is men disbelievers and stones like their very idols indicating that its heat is extreme since it burns with the stones mentioned unlike the fires of this world that burn with wood and similar materials; prepared and made ready for disbelievers so that they are punished in it this phrase u‘iddat li’l-kāfirīna ‘prepared for disbelievers’ is either a new sentence or a sustained circumstantial qualifier."
