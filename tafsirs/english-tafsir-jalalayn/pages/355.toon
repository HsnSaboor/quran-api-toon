  24,37,"men rijālun the subject of the verb yusabbihu ‘make glorifications’; if the passive is read yusabbahu ‘glorifications are made’ it rijālun ‘men’ substitutes for the impersonal subject of lahu ‘to Him’ so that rijālun ‘men’ is the subject of an implied verb in response to an implied question as if one had asked who makes glorifications to Him? whom neither trading purchase nor sale distracts from the remembrance of God and the observance of prayer the final hā’ of iqāmat ‘the observance’ has been omitted to facilitate the reading and payment of the alms. They fear a day when hearts and eyes will be tossed about in fear the hearts tossed about between the hope of deliverance and the fear of destruction and the eyes to the right and to the left out of anxiety — this is the Day of Resurrection;"
  24,38,"so that God may reward them for the best of what they did that is reward them the reward for it ahsana means husna and give them more out of His bounty; and God provides whomever He will without any reckoning one says of someone yunfiqu bi-ghayri hisābin to mean that such a person is so generous that it is as though he does not need to reckon what he spends."
  24,39,"And as for those who disbelieve their works are like a mirage in a plain qī‘a is the plural of qā‘ that is to say fulāt ‘an open space’. A mirage is a kind of radiation which one might observe therein at midday during extreme heat resembling running water — which the thirsty man supposes to be water until he comes to it and finds it to be nothing like what he had supposed. Likewise is the case of the disbeliever who supposes that his deeds such as some voluntary alms will benefit him; but when he dies and comes before his Lord he will not find his deed in other words it will be of no benefit to him; and he finds God there namely in the place of his deeds Who pays him his account in full that is He requites him for it in this world; and God is swift at reckoning that is at requiting."
  24,40,"Or it is that those who disbelieve their evil deeds are as the manifold darkness on a deep sea covered by a billow above which that is above which billow there is another billow above which second billow there are clouds these being the manifold layers of darkness one on top of another the darkness of the sea the darkness of the first billow the darkness of the second together with the darkness of the clouds. When he an observer holds out his hand in such layers of darkness he can scarcely see it in other words he would not even come close to seeing it. And he whom God has not granted any light has no light that is to say he whom God does not guide cannot be guided."
  24,41,"Have you not seen that God is glorified by all who are in the heavens and the earth prayer being one form of glorification and the birds tayr is the plural of tā’ir between the heaven and the earth spreading their wings? sāffātin is a circumstantial qualifier. Of each one of them He God verily knows its prayer and its glorification; and God knows what they do — the statement is predominantly directed to rational beings."
  24,42,"And to God belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth the treasuries of rain provision and vegetation and with God is the journey’s end the final return."
  24,43,"Have you not seen how God drives the clouds moves them along gently then composes them joining some with others and making scattered pieces as one then piles them up some on top of others whereat you see the rain issuing from the midst of them from specific outlets in them? And He sends down from the heaven out of the mountains min jibālin min is extra that are therein in the heaven fīhā substitutes for mina’l-samā’i ‘from the heaven’ with the repetition of a genitive preposition hail that is He sends down some hail and smites with it whom He will and turns it away from whom He will. The brilliance of its lightning its flashing would almost take away the eyes that look at it in other words it would almost snatching them away."
