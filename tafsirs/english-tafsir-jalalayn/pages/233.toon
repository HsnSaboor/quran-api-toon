  11,100,"That which is mentioned dhālika is the subject the predicate of which follows is something of the tidings of the towns which We relate to you O Muhammad (s). Some of them that is of the towns are standing only its inhabitants having been destroyed and some of them have been cut down destroyed together with its inhabitants such that there are no vestiges thereof much like crops harvested with sickles."
  11,101,"And We did not wrong them destroying them for not having committed any sins but they wronged themselves through idolatry. Their gods did not avail defend them in any way min shay’in min is extra those gods upon whom they called whom they worshipped besides God that is other than Him when the command of your Lord His chastisement came; and they their gods — through their the disbelievers’ worship of these gods did not increase them in anything but ruin but loss."
  11,102,"Such like that seizing is the seizing of your Lord when He seizes the towns meaning its inhabitants while they are doing wrong by way of sins in other words nothing can avail them in any way when He seizes them. Truly His seizing is painful severe.

Truly your Lord is Doer of what He desires."
  11,108,"And as for those who are fortunate read sa‘idū or su‘idū they shall be in Paradise abiding therein for as long as the heavens and the earth endure except other than what your Lord may will — as mentioned already of increasing the duration which in their case is indicated by His words an endless bounty one not to be cut off.
