  2,197,"The Pilgrimage the time for it is in months well-known Shawwāl Dhū’l-Qa’da and ten nights some say all of Dhū’l Hijja; whoever undertakes upon himself the duty of Pilgrimage during them by entering into the state of pilgrimage inviolability then no lewdness no sexual intercourse for them nor wickedness nor acts of disobedience or disputing or quarrelling in the Pilgrimage a variant reading for fa-lā rafathun wa-lā fusūqun wa-lā jidāla has the accusative for all three nouns sc. fa-lā rafatha wa-lā fusūqa wa-lā jidāla; prohibition is meant in all three cases. Whatever good you do by way of voluntary almsgiving God knows it and will reward you for it. And take provision to suffice you your journey this was revealed regarding the people of Yemen who use to make the Pilgrimage and not take any provisions with them thus becoming a burden for others. But the best provision is piety taqwā ‘piety’ literally ‘guarding’ with which you are able to guard against asking others for things; and fear you Me O people of pith! O possessors of intellect."
  2,198,"You would not be at fault if you should seek bounty sustenance from your Lord by engaging in commerce at the Pilgrimage this was revealed in response to their aversion to such an idea; but when you press on push on from ‘Arafāt having stood in prayer upon it then remember God after the overnight stay at Muzdalifa by repeating the talbiya sc. labbayka Llāhummā labbayk ‘at thy service O God at thy service’ the tahlīl lā ilāha illā Llāh ‘no god but God’ and making supplications at the Sacred Waymark a mountain at the end of Muzdalifa called Quzah. In one hadīth the Prophet s stood there remembering God and supplicating until his face began to glow brightly according to Muslim; and remember Him as He has guided you to the principal rites of His religion and the rituals of His Pilgrimage the kāf of ka-mā ‘as’ is the particle denoting the reason though previously before His guidance you were astray."
  2,199,"Then thumma denotes the sequence intended press on O Quraysh from where the people press on that is from ‘Arafa by standing there together with them for they used to stand at Muzdalifa disdaining to stand with other people; and seek God’s forgiveness for your sins; God is Forgiving Merciful to the believers."
  2,200,"And when you have performed and completed your holy rites that is the devotions pertaining to your pilgrimage having cast stones at the Jamrat al-‘Aqaba performed the circumambulation and stopped at Minā remember God by extolling Him and repeating the takbīr saying Allāhu akbar ‘God is Great’ as you remember your fathers as you used to remember them and boast about them at the end of your pilgrimage or yet more intensely than your remembrance of them ashadda is in the accusative because it is a circumstantial qualifier referring to dhikr ‘remembrance’ which itself is in the accusative as the object of udhkurū ‘remember’ because had it come after it it would have functioned as an adjectival phrase. There are some people who say ‘Our Lord give to us our lot in this world’ and they are given it; such people will have no part no lot in the Hereafter."
  2,201,"And there are others who say ‘Our Lord give to us in this world good a grace and good Paradise in the Hereafter and guard us against the chastisement of the Fire’ by not making us enter it. This former statement depicts the manner of the idolaters while the latter the way of the believers and is intended to encourage people to petition for good in both abodes for which one is promised a reward as He says"
  2,202,"Those — they shall have a portion a reward from as a result of what they have earned the deeds they have performed such as Pilgrimage and supplication; and God is swift at reckoning reckoning with the whole of creation in half a day of this world as one hadīth states."
