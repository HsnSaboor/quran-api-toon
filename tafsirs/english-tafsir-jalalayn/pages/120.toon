  5,71,"And they thought they presumed that there would be no read as an lā takūnu where an has been softened; or read an lā takūna where it an requires a following subjunctive that is to say ‘that there would not befall them’ trial a punishment against them for their denial of the messengers and their slaying of them; and so they were wilfully blind to the truth and could not see it and deaf unable to hear it. Then God relented to them when they repented then they were wilfully blind and deaf a second time many of them kathīrun minhum substitutes for the third person ‘they’; and God sees what they do and will requite them for it."
  5,72,"They indeed are disbelievers those who say ‘Indeed God is the Messiah son of Mary’ a similar verse has preceded Q. 517. For the Messiah said to them ‘O Children of Israel worship God my Lord and your Lord for I am a servant and not a god. Verily he who associates anything with God in worship for him God has made Paradise forbidden He has forbidden him admittance to it and his abode shall be the Fire; and for wrongdoers wa-mā li’l-zālimīna min the min is extra there shall be no helpers’ to guard them against the chastisement of God."
  5,73,"They are indeed disbelievers those who say ‘God is the third of three’ gods that is He is one of them the other two being Jesus and his mother and they who claim this are a Christian sect; when there is no god but the One God. If they do not desist from what they say when they declare a trinity and profess His Oneness those of them who disbelieve that is those who are fixed upon unbelief shall suffer a painful chastisement namely the Fire."
  5,74,"Will they not turn in repentance to God and seek His forgiveness? for what they say the interrogative is intended as a rebuke; God is Forgiving to the one who repents Merciful to him."
  5,75,"The Messiah son of Mary was only a messenger; messengers passed away before him and so he passed away like them for he is not a god as they claim otherwise he would not have passed away; his mother was a truthful woman siddīqa means extremely truthful; they both used to eat food like all other human beings and one who is such cannot be a god because of his compound being and fallible nature and because of the impurities such as urine and excrement that he produces. Behold in amazement how We make the signs of Our Oneness clear to them then behold how they are turned away! how they are turned away from the truth despite the proof being established."
  5,76,"Say ‘Do you worship besides God that is other than Him what cannot hurt or profit you? God is the Hearer of your sayings the Knower’ of your circumstances the interrogative is meant as a disavowal."
