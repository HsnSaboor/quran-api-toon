tafsir[4]{c,v,t}:
  6,91,"They that is the Jews measured not God with His true measure that is they have not extended Him the grandeur that truly befits Him or it means they have not attained the true knowledge of Him when they said to the Prophet s disputing with him about the Qur’ān ‘God has not revealed anything to any mortal.’ Say to them ‘Who revealed the Book which Moses brought a light and guidance for mankind? You put it in all three instances the verbs may be read either in the third person plural yaj‘alūnahu ‘they put it’; yubdūnahā ‘they reveal it’; wa-yukhfūna ‘and they hide’ or in the second person plural taj‘alūnahu ‘you put it’; tubdūnahā ‘you reveal it’; wa-tukhfūna ‘and you hide’ on parchments that is you write it down on fragments of notes which you disclose that is what you choose to disclose thereof but you hide much of what is in them as in the case of the descriptions of Muhammad (s); and you have been taught O Jews in the Qur’ān what you did not know neither you nor your fathers’ in the Torah through the elucidation therein of what you were confused about and in disagreement over. Say ‘God’ revealed it — and if they do not say it there is no other response — then leave them to play in their discourse their falsehood."
  6,92,"And this Qur’ān is a blessed Book We have revealed confirming that which was before it of scriptures and that you may warn li-tundhira or read li-yundhira ‘that it may warn’ as supplement to the import of the preceding statement sc. ‘to confirm that which was before it and to warn’ in other words We have revealed it for the blessings it gives as a vindication of previous scripture and for you to warn therewith the Mother of Towns and those around it that is the inhabitants of Mecca and all other people; and those who believe in the Hereafter believe in it and they observe their prayers fearing the punishment thereof."
  6,93,"And who that is none does greater evil than he who invents lies against God by claiming prophethood when he has not been called to it or who says ‘It is revealed to me’ when nothing has been revealed to him — this was revealed regarding the false prophet Musaylama al-Kadhdhāb — or he who says ‘I will reveal the like of what God has revealed’? — these were the mockers who would say If we wish we can speak the like of this Q. 831; If you could only see O Muhammad (s) when the mentioned evildoers are in the agonies the throes of death and the angels extend their hands against them beating and torturing them saying to them in stern censure ‘Give up your souls! to us that we may seize them. Today you shall be requited with the chastisement of humiliation because you used to say about God other than the truth of claiming prophethood and inspiration falsely and that you used to scorn His signs’ disdaining to believe in them. The response to the conditional statement beginning with law ‘if you could only see’ is ‘you would be seeing a terrifying thing’."
  6,94,"And it is said to them upon their resurrection ‘And now you have come to Us singly each alone without family possessions or children as We created you the first time that is barefoot naked and with foreskins and you have left what We conferred on you of wealth behind your backs in the world without you having any choice; and — it is said to them in rebuke — We do not see with you your intercessors the idols whom you claimed to be associates of God amongst you that is in deserving your worship; it has been severed between you that is to say your bond has been dissolved a variant reading for baynukum ‘your union’ has baynakum ‘between you’ making it an adverbial qualifier that is the bond ‘between you’ has been severed’ and that intercession of theirs which you claimed in the world has failed abandoned you’."
