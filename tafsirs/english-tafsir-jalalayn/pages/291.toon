tafsir[10]{c,v,t}:
  17,87,"it is only — but We have let it remain — as a mercy from your Lord. Truly His favour to you is ever great tremendous for He has revealed to you and granted you the praiseworthy station as well as other kinds of merit."
  17,88,"Say ‘Verily should mankind and jinn come together to produce the like of this Qur’ān the like thereof in terms of clarity and rhetorical excellence they could not produce the like thereof even if they backed one another’ even if one was an assistant of the other. This verse was revealed as a refutation of their statement ‘If we wish we can speak the like of this’ Q. 831."
  17,89,"And verily We have dispensed explained for people in this Qur’ān every kind of similitude min kulli mathalin this is an adjectival qualification of an omitted clause in other words ‘We have dispensed a similitude from every kind of similitude’ that they might be admonished; but most people that is the people of Mecca insist on disbelieving on denying the truth."
  17,90,"And they say wa-qālū is a supplement to abā illā ‘insist on’ ‘We will not believe you until you make gush forth for us from the ground a spring from which water issues forth;"
  17,91,"or until you come to have a garden an orchard of date-palms and vines and cause streams to gush forth therein in the midst of these abundantly;"
  17,92,"or until you cause the heaven to fall upon us as you assert in pieces or bring God and the angels right in front of us face to face with us before our very eyes so that we might see them;"
  17,93,"or until you come to have a house adorned with gold or ascend into the heaven upon a ladder and even then we will not believe your ascension if you were to ascend into it until you bring down for us therefrom a book in which is confirmed your truthfulness that we may read’. Say to them ‘Glory be to my Lord — this is a statement of amazement — Am I anything but a human a messenger from God?’ in other words I am like all other messengers for they never brought any signs except by God’s leave."
  17,94,"And nothing prevented mankind from believing when guidance came to them but that they said that is except their saying in denial ‘Has God sent a human as a messenger from Him?’ instead of sending an angel."
  17,95,"Say to them ‘Had there been in the earth instead of humans angels walking and living secure We would have sent down to them from the heaven an angel as Messenger’ for when a messenger is sent to a people he is always of their kind so that they are able to speak to him and understand from him his message."
  17,96,"Say ‘God suffices as a witness between me and you of my sincerity. Truly He is Aware Seer of His servants’ Knower of what they hide and what they manifest."
