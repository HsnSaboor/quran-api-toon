tafsir[10]{c,v,t}:
  28,85,"Indeed He Who has prescribed for you the Qur’ān He Who has revealed it will surely restore you to a place of return to Mecca — he had yearned for it. Say ‘My Lord knows best him who brings guidance and him who is in manifest error’ — this was revealed in order to refute what the Meccan disbelievers had said to him ‘Indeed you are error’. In other words God is saying that he the Prophet is the one who has brought guidance while they are the ones in error."
  28,86,"And you never expected that the Scripture the Qur’ān would be conferred on you; but it was conferred on you as a mercy from your Lord. So never be a supporter of the disbelievers in that religion of theirs to which they summon you."
  28,87,"And never let them bar you yasuddunnaka is actually yasuddūnannaka but the nūn of the indicative ending has been omitted because of the apocopating particle lā as has the wāw of the third person plural subject of the verb because of its coming together with an unvocalised nūn from God’s signs after they have been revealed to you in other words do not consult with them in such matters and summon people to your Lord by affirming His Oneness and worshipping Him and never be of the idolaters by supporting them lā takūnanna the apocopating particle does not affect the ending of the verb here because of its invariability."
  28,88,"And do not call on do not worship another god with God; there is no god except Him. Everything will perish except His Countenance except Him. His is the judgement the effective decree and to Him you will be brought back by being raised from the grave."
  29,1,"Alif lām mīm God knows best what He means by these letters."
  29,2,"Do people suppose that they will be left to say that is that they will be left alone because of their saying ‘We believe’ and they will not be tried? tested with that which will reveal the sincerity of their belief. This verse was revealed regarding a group of individuals who when they became believers endured suffering at the hands of the idolaters."
  29,3,"And certainly We tried those who were before them. So God shall surely know those who are sincere in their faith — a knowledge of direct vision — and He shall surely know those who are liars regarding it."
  29,4,"Or do those who commit evil deeds idolatry and acts of disobedience suppose that they can elude Us? so that We will not be able to requite them. Evil is that judgement of theirs which they judge!"
  29,5,"Whoever expects to encounter God should know that God’s appointed term for this encounter will indeed come; so let him prepare for it. And He is the Hearer of the sayings of His servants the Knower of their actions."
  29,6,"And whoever struggles in war or against the temptations of his own soul struggles only for his own sake because the benefits to be reaped from his struggle will be for his sake and not for God’s. For truly God is Independent of the creatures of all the Worlds mankind jinn and angels and He is also without need of their worship."
