tafsir[7]{c,v,t}:
  4,80,"Whoever obeys the Messenger verily obeys God; and whoever turns his back whoever avoids obedience to you do not be concerned with them We have not sent you as a watcher over them to keep watch over their deeds but as a warner. Their affair is Ours to deal with and We will requite them. This statement was before the command to fight them was revealed."
  4,81,"They say that is the hypocrites say when they come to you ‘Our affair is all about Obedience to you’; but when they sally forth when they depart from you a party of them harbour the final tā’ of the feminine-ending in bayyatat ‘harbour’ can either be elided with the following tā’ of tā’ifa ‘a party’ or simply omitted they entertain secretly feelings other than what they say to you in your presence in the way of their obedience in other words they hide disobedience to you. God writes down He commands that it be written what they harbour in their scrolls of deeds so that they will be requited for it. So turn away from them in forgiveness rely on God put your trust in Him for He will suffice you; and God suffices as a Guardian to Whom matters are entrusted."
  4,82,"What do they not ponder do they not contemplate the Qur’ān? and the marvellous truths contained in it. If it had been from other than God surely they would have found therein much inconsistency much contradiction in meaning and irregularity in arrangement."
  4,83,"And when there comes to them an issue news concerning the raiding parties sent by the Prophet s and what has happened to them be it of security through victory or of fear through defeat they broadcast it they make it widely-known this was revealed regarding a group from among the hypocrites or from among the feeble believers who used to do this and so the hearts of the believers would lose courage and the Prophet s would become distressed. If they had referred it the news to the Messenger and to those in authority among them that is the judicious elders among the Companions in other words if they had kept quiet about it until they were fully informed; those among them who are able to think it out those who follow it up and seek knowledge of it the ones who broadcast it would have known it and whether it is a matter that ought be broadcast or not from them from the Prophet s and those of authority. And but for the bounty of God to you through Islam and His mercy to you through the Qur’ān you would surely have followed Satan in the abominations to which he commands you except a few of you."
  4,84,"So fight O Muhammad (s) in the way of God; you are charged only with yourself so do not be concerned with their failing to join you the meaning being fight even if you are on your own for you have been promised victory. And urge on the believers incite them to fight and make them desire it; maybe God will restrain the might the war of the disbelievers; God is mightier than them and more severe in castigation in punishment than them. And so the Messenger of God s said ‘By Him in Whose Hand is my soul I shall sally forth to fight even if I go alone’. Thereupon he sallied forth with seventy cavalrymen to the first battle at Badr where God restrained the might of the disbelievers by casting terror into their hearts and preventing Abū Sufyān from sallying forth as has already been mentioned in sūrat Āl ‘Imrān Q. 3151."
  4,85,"Whoever intercedes between people with a good intercession one in accordance with the Law shall receive a share of the reward for it because of it; and whoever intercedes with an evil intercession one in contravention of it the Law shall receive the like the share of the sin from it because of it. God conserves He has power over all things and so requites every person according to his deeds."
  4,86,"And when you are greeted with a greeting as when it is said to you ‘Peace be upon you’ greet the one that greeted you with better than it by responding to him with ‘Peace be upon you and God’s mercy and blessings’ or return it by saying back to him what he said; in other words it is a duty to greet in one of these two ways the former being the preferred one. Surely God keeps count of He holds you accountable for all things and requites accordingly including things such as returning a greeting. The Sunna specifies that one should not return the greeting of an disbeliever an innovator a wicked person and of the one that greets a person who is in the act of relieving himself or one in the bath or one eating — indeed it is actually disapproved with the exception of the last. To the disbeliever who says ‘peace be upon you’ one should simply say ‘And upon you’."
