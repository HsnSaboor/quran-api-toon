tafsir[6]{c,v,t}:
  4,135,"O you who believe be upright in justice; witnesses of the truth for God even though it the witnessing be against yourselves so be witness against them your selves by affirming the truth and not concealing it; or against parents and kinsmen whether the person witnessed against be rich or poor; God is closer to the two than you and He has better knowledge of what is good for them. So do not follow any whim in your testimonies by being partial to the rich one seeking his pleasure or by being partial to the poor one out of compassion for him lest you swerve so that you do not incline away from the truth for if you twist a variant reading for talwūw has talū if you distort your testimony or refrain from giving it surely God is ever aware of what you do and will requite you accordingly."
  4,136,"O you who believe believe with perseverance in God and His Messenger and the Book which has been revealed to His Messenger Muhammad (s) and that is the Qur’ān; and the Book which was revealed before to the messengers namely the scriptures a variant reading for nuzzila and unzila ‘was revealed’ has the active form for both verbs nazzala and anzala ‘He revealed’. And whoever disbelieves in God and His angels and His Books and His messengers and the Last Day verily he has strayed far away from the truth."
  4,137,"Verily those who believed in Moses namely the Jews and then disbelieved by worshipping the calf and then believed after that and then disbelieved in Jesus and then increased in disbelief in Muhammad — it was not for God to forgive them for what they have persisted in of disbelief nor to guide them to a way to the truth."
  4,138,"Give tidings to inform O Muhammad (s) the hypocrites that for them there is a painful chastisement namely the chastisement of the Fire."
  4,139,"Those who alladhīna is either a substitution for or an adjectival qualification of al-munāfiqīna ‘the hypocrites’ take disbelievers for friends instead of believers because they mistakenly believe them to be strong — do they desire do they seek power with them? an interrogative of disavowal that is to say they shall not find such power with them. Truly power belongs altogether to God in this world and the Hereafter and none but His friends shall attain it."
  4,140,"It has been revealed read active nazzala ‘He has revealed’ or passive nuzzila ‘It has been revealed’ to you in the Book in the Qur’ān in sūrat al-An‘ām Q. 668 that an has been softened and its subject omitted in other words read it as annahu ‘When you hear God’s signs the Qur’ān being disbelieved in and mocked do not sit with them that is the disbelievers and the mockers until they engage in some other talk for otherwise you if you were to sit with them would surely be like them’ in sinfulness. God will gather the hypocrites and disbelievers all together into Hell just as they were gathered together in this world in unbelief and mockery."
