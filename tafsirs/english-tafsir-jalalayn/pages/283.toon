tafsir[10]{c,v,t}:
  17,8,"And We said in the Scripture It may be that your Lord will have mercy upon you after the second time if you were to repent; but if you revert to working corruption We too will revert to punishment. And assuredly they did revert by denying the Prophet s and so he was given power over them through the slaying of the Banū Qurayza the expulsion of the Banū Nadīr and the exacting of the jizya-tax from them; and We have made Hell a dungeon for the disbelievers a place of detention and a prison for them."
  17,9,"Truly this Qur’ān guides to that to that way which is straightest most upright and correct and gives tidings to the believers who perform righteous deeds that there is a great reward for them."
  17,10,"And it this Qur’ān informs that those who do not believe in the Hereafter We have prepared for them a painful chastisement namely the Fire."
  17,11,"And man prays for ill against himself and his family when he is frustrated as avidly as he prays for good. And mankind is ever hasty to pray against himself without contemplating the consequence thereof."
  17,12,"And We made the night and the day two signs both indicators of Our power. Then We effaced the sign of the night extinguishing its light with darkness so that you might repose therein the annexation āyata’layli ‘the sign of the night’ is explicative and made the sign of the day sight-giving in other words one in which it is possible to see because of the light; that you may seek therein bounty from your Lord by earning your livelihood and that you may know by both day and night the number of years and the reckoning of the times of the day and everything that might be needed We have detailed very distinctly We have explained clearly."
  17,13,"And We have attached every person’s omen — his deeds — for him to carry upon his neck — this site is singled out for mention because fastening something to it is much more severe; Mujāhid b. Jabr al-Makkī said ‘There is not a child born but it has a leaf around its neck in which it is decreed that the child will be either fortunate or damned’ — and We shall bring forth for him on the Day of Resurrection a book in which his deeds are recorded and which he will find wide open yalqāhu manshūran both are adjectival qualifications of kitāban ‘a book’."
  17,14,"And it will be said to him ‘Read your book! This day your soul suffices as your own reckoner’."
  17,15,"Whoever is guided is guided only to the good of his own soul because the reward of his guidance will be for him; and whoever goes astray goes astray only to its his soul’s detriment because the sin thereof will be held against it. No burdened no sinful soul shall bear the burden of another soul. And We never chastise anyone until We have sent a messenger to make clear to him that which is his obligation."
  17,16,"And when We desire to destroy a town We command its affluent ones those inhabitants of its who enjoy the graces of God meaning its leaders We command them to obedience by the tongue of Our messengers; but they fall into immorality therein rebelling against Our command and so the Word is justified concerning it that it should be chastised and We destroy it utterly We annihilate it by annihilating its inhabitants and leaving it in ruins."
  17,17,"How many — in other words many — generations communities We have destroyed since Noah! And your Lord suffices as One Informed and Beholder of the sins of His servants Knower of the hidden and manifest aspects of these sins bi-rabbika ‘your Lord’ is semantically connected to bi-dhunūb ‘of the sins’."
