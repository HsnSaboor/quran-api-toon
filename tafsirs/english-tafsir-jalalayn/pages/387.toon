  28,14,"And when he came of age namely at 30 or 33 and then was fully mature that is when he reached the age of 40 We gave him judgement wisdom and knowledge comprehension of religious matters before he was sent as a prophet. And so just as We rewarded him do We reward those are virtuous to their own souls."
  28,15,"And he Moses entered the city Pharaoh’s city Memphis having been absent from it for a while at a time when its people were oblivious the time of the afternoon nap and found therein two men fighting one of his own faction namely an Israelite and the other of his enemies in other words an Egyptian who was exploiting an Israelite to carry firewood to Pharaoh’s kitchen. So the one who was of his faction called to him for help against the one who was of his enemies and so Moses said to him ‘Leave him be!’ and it is said that he replied to Moses thus ‘I am truly considering making you carry this firewood!’. So Moses punched him that is he hit him with his fist clenched — he Moses was a strong man with a powerful strike and did away with him that is he killed him but he had not intended to kill him. He buried him in the sand. He said ‘This killing of him is of Satan’s doing inciting my anger. Indeed he is an enemy to the son of Adam a manifest misleader’ of him."
  28,16,"He said remorsefully ‘My Lord I have indeed wronged myself by killing him so forgive me!’ So He forgave him. Truly He is the Forgiving the Merciful that is to say the One Who has always possessed and will always possess these two attributes."
  28,17,"He said ‘My Lord forasmuch as You have been gracious to me with forgiveness protect me so I will never be a partisan a supporter of the criminals’ the disbelievers henceforth if you were to protect me."
  28,18,"In the morning he was in the city fearful vigilant waiting to see what would happen to him in reaction from the side of the slain man; — when behold the one who had sought his help the day before cried out to him for help again asking for his help against another Egyptian. Moses said to him ‘Clearly you are a trouble-maker!’ whose trouble-making is evident judging by what you did yesterday and today."
  28,19,"But when fa-lammā an an is extra he was about to strike the man who was an enemy to both of them to Moses and the one seeking his help he the one seeking help supposing that Moses was about to strike him because of what he Moses had said to him said ‘O Moses do you want to slay me just as you slew a soul yesterday? You merely want to be a tyrant in the land and you do not want to be of the reformers’. The Egyptian heard this and realised that the slayer had been Moses. Thus he hurried off to Pharaoh to inform him of this. Pharaoh then ordered slaughterers to slay Moses and they set off in his direction."
  28,20,"And a man who was the only believer among Pharaoh’s kinsfolk came from the outskirts of the city hastening walking fast via a route quicker than theirs. He said ‘O Moses lo! the council of Pharaoh’s folk are conspiring discussing the means to slay you. So leave the city. Truly I am speaking to you in good faith’ in bidding you to leave."
  28,21,"So he departed from it fearful vigilant lest any of the pursuers catch up with him or in the hope that God might rescue him. He said ‘My Lord deliver me from the evildoing people’ Pharaoh’s people."
