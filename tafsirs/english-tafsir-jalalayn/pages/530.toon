  54,28,"And inform them that the water is to be divided between them and the She-camel one day for them and the next for it every drinking every portion of water will be attended’ by the people drawing water on their designated day and by the She-camel on its day. They adhered to this regime but eventually became impatient with it and decided to slaughter the She-camel."
  54,29,"But they called their companion Qudār to slay it so he took he drew his sword and he hamstrung with it the She-camel in other words he slew her in compliance with their wish."
  54,30,"How then were My chastisement and My warnings? My warning them of chastisement before it was sent down? In other words it was justified. He explains it their chastisement by saying"
  54,31,"Indeed We unleashed upon them a single Cry and they became like the chaff of a corral builder al-muhtazir is one who makes a pen from dried tree-branches and thorns for his sheep to protect them from wolves and beasts of prey; the fallen parts which they tread are called hashīm."
  54,32,"And verily We have made the Qur’ān easy to remember. So is there anyone who will remember?"
  54,33,"The people of Lot denied the warnings they denied those issues of which they were warned by his Lot’s tongue."
  54,34,"Indeed We unleashed upon them a squall of pebbles a wind hurling at them pebbles namely small stones a single one of these being no larger than the palm of the hand and they were destroyed; all except the family of Lot namely his two daughters together with him whom We delivered at dawn from among the dawns the morning time of an unspecified day had a specific day been meant for that mentioned dawn it sahar would have been treated as a diptote instead of the declined form saharin being a definite noun derived from al-sahar for with definite nouns one ought to use the preceding definite article al. So was the squall unleashed at first with the family of Lot still there? There are two opinions regarding this in the case of the former that it was unleashed upon them including the family of Lot the exception is understood as a continuous one while in the case of the latter opinion that they were delivered before the squall the exception is understood as a discontinuous one even if it ‘the family of Lot’ is actually subsumed by the collective noun ‘the people of Lot’ and so they were delivered as a kindness from God;"
  54,35,"as a grace ni‘matan is a verbal noun that is to say in‘āman ‘an act of grace’ from Us. So like that requital do We requite him who gives thanks for Our graces and is a believer or it means him who is a believer in God and His messenger and is obedient to both."

So We blotted out their eyes We blinded them and made them without slits so that they were continuous folds of skin like the rest of the face by having Gabriel smack them with his wing. ‘So taste now so We said to them taste My chastisement and My warnings’ that is to say taste the effects and the substance of My warning and My threat."
  54,38,"And verily there greeted them in the early morning the morning time of an unspecified day an abiding chastisement a permanent chastisement continuous with the chastisement of the Hereafter."
  54,39,"‘So taste now My chastisement and My warnings!’"

  54,43,"Are your disbelievers O Quraysh better than those? mentioned beginning from the people of Noah to those of Pharaoh which is why they have not been chastised? Or have you O disbelievers of Quraysh been granted some immunity from chastisement in the Scriptures? the Books? the interrogative in both instances is meant as a denial in other words it is not so."
  54,44,"Or do they the disbelievers of Quraysh say ‘We are a host that will be helped to victory’? against Muhammad (s)? When Abū Jahl on the day of Badr said ‘We are a host that will be helped to victory’ the following was revealed"

  54,48,"The day when they are dragged into the Fire on their faces in the Hereafter and it is said to them ‘Taste now the touch of Saqar’ Hell’s affliction of you."
  54,49,"Truly everything read inna kulla shay’in is in the accusative as a dependent clause because of a verb governing it have We created in a measure by ordainment bi-qadarin ‘in a measure’ is a circumstantial qualifier referring to kulla ‘every’ in other words ‘already predetermined’; a variant reading for kulla has nominative kullu as the subject the predicate of which is khalaqnāhu ‘We have created’."
