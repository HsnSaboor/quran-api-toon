  24,62,"Only they are believers who believe in God and His Messenger and who when they are with him namely the Messenger in a collective affair such as during the Friday sermon do not leave when they have an excuse until they have asked leave of him. Truly those who ask leave of you — it is they who believe in God and His Messenger. So when they ask leave of you for some affair some matter of theirs give permission to whom you will of them to leave and ask God to forgive them. Truly God is Forgiving Merciful."
  24,63,"Do not among yourselves consider the calling of the Messenger to be like your calling of one another by saying ‘O Muhammad!’ s but say ‘O Prophet of God’ or ‘O Messenger of God!’ gently respectfully and in a low voice. Verily God knows those of you who slip away surreptitiously that is those who leave the mosque secretly during the sermon without asking leave hiding behind something qad ‘verily’ is for confirmation. So let those who contravene His command that is God’s command or that of His Messenger beware lest an ordeal a trial befall them or there befall them a painful chastisement in the Hereafter."
  24,64,"Lo! surely to God belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth by way of possession creation and servitude. He is ever aware of how you O you who are obligated to the prescriptions of the Law are behaving with regard to faith or hypocrisy and He knows the day when they shall be returned to Him there is a shift here from the second person address to that of the third person in other words He knows when this day will be — He will inform them thereupon of what they did of good and evil and God is Knower of all things which they do and otherwise."
  25,1,"Blessed exalted is He Who revealed the Criterion al-furqān the Qur’ān — called thus al-furqān because it has discriminated faraqa between truth and falsehood — to His servant Muhammad (s) that he may be to all the worlds to mankind and the jinn but not the angels a warner a threatening of God’s chastisement."
  25,2,"He to Whom belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and Who has not taken a son nor has He any partner in sovereignty; and He created everything which was meant to be created and then determined it in a precise measure He fashioned it in a balanced form."
