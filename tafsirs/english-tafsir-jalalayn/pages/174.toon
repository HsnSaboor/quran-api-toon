tafsir[9]{c,v,t}:
  7,179,"And We have indeed urged unto Hell many of the jinn and mankind having hearts wherewith they do not understand the truth and having eyes wherewith they do not perceive the proofs of God’s power with a perception that entails reflection and having ears wherewith they do not hear the signs or the admonitions in a way so as to reflect and take heed. These they are like cattle in their failure to understand perceive or listen — nay rather they are further astray than cattle because at least they cattle seek what is beneficial to them and stay away from what is harmful to them these individuals on the other hand are proceeding towards the Fire out of sheer obstinacy. These — they are the heedless."
  7,180,"And to God belong the ninety nine Most Beautiful Names — mentioned in hadīth — al-husnā is the feminine for al-ahsan so invoke name Him by them and leave those who blaspheme His Names yulhidūn ‘they blaspheme’ from fourth form alhada or first form lahada meaning ‘those who incline away from the truth’ by deriving from them names for their gods as in the case of al-Lāt from Allāh ‘God’ al-‘Uzzā from al-‘Azīz ‘Mighty’ and Manāt from al-Mannān ‘Lord of Favours’. They will be requited in the Hereafter the requital for what they did — this was revealed before the command to fight them."
  7,181,"And of those whom We created there is a community who guide by the truth and act justly therewith this is the community of Muhammad (s) as stated in a hadīth."
  7,182,"And those who deny Our signs — the Qur’ān — from among the people of Mecca We will draw them on by degrees We will lead them on gradually whence they do not know."
  7,183,"And I will respite them — assuredly My scheme is strong powerful and cannot be withstood."
  7,184,"Have they not considered and so realised that that there is no madness in their comrade Muhammad (s)? He is but a clear warner one whose warning is evident."
  7,185,"And have they not reflected upon the dominion the kingdom malakūt is mulk of the heaven and of the earth and upon what things God has created min shay’in is an explication of the preceding mā ‘what’ so that they are able to infer the power of their Creator and His Oneness and upon that upon the fact that it may be that their term is already near so that they might hasten to believe lest they die as disbelievers and move towards the Fire? In what fact then after this that is the Qur’ān will they believe?"
  7,186,"Whomever God sends astray he has no guide. And He leaves them read in the imperfect indicative wa-yadharuhum or wa-nadharuhum ‘and We leave them’ as the beginning of a new sentence; or the same verbs in the imperfect jussive apocopated form wa-yadharhum or wa-nadharhum as a supplement to what comes after fā’ of fa-lā hādiya lahu ‘so he has no guide’ in their insolence to wander on blindly hesitating out of perplexity."
  7,187,"They that is the people of Mecca will question you about the Hour the Resurrection when it shall come to pass. Say to them ‘The knowledge of when it shall be is only with my Lord. He alone shall reveal it manifest it at its proper time li-waqtihā the lām here functions as fī ‘at’. It weighs heavily tremendously in the heavens and the earth upon their inhabitants because of its awesomeness. It will not come on you save all of a sudden’. They will question you as if you were preoccupied with obsessed with inquiring about it such that you have come to acquire knowledge of it. Say ‘Knowledge of it is only with God innamā ‘ilmuhā ‘inda’Llāhi is for emphasis but most people do not know’ that knowledge of it lies with God exalted be He."
