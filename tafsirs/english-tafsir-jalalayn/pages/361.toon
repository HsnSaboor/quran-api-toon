  25,12,"When it sees them from a distant place they will hear it raging boiling like an enraged person when his heart boils with anger and roaring producing a powerful noise. Alternatively what is meant by their ‘hearing it raging’ is their vision of it and awareness of it."
  25,13,"And when they are flung into a narrow place thereof read dayyiqan or dayqan ‘narrow’ such that it constricts them; minhā ‘thereof’ is a circumstantial qualifier referring to makānan ‘place’ because it is actually an adjectival qualification of it bound together shackled with their hands bound to their necks in chains the use of the intensive form muqarranīna as opposed to muqranīna is meant to indicate a large number they will at that point pray for their own annihilation and it will be said to them"
  25,14,"‘Do not pray for a single annihilation on this day but pray for many annihilations!’ which will be the nature of your chastisement."
  25,15,"Say ‘Is that which is mentioned of the threat of chastisement and the description of the Fire better or the Garden of Immortality which has been promised to the God-fearing which will be in God’s knowledge exalted be He their requital their reward and journey’s end?’ their place of return."
  25,16,"In it they shall have what they wish abiding therein — an irrevocable state — it the promise to them of what is mentioned is a promise binding on your Lord a promise much besought requested by those who have been promised it as is clear from the following Our Lord grant us what You have promised us through Your messengers Q. 3194 or requested on their behalf by the angels who say Our Lord and admit them into the Gardens of Eden which You have promised them Q. 408."
  25,17,"And on the day when He will assemble them yahshuruhum; a variant reading has nahshuruhum ‘We assemble them’ and that which they worship besides God that is other than Him such as the angels Jesus Ezra and the jinn and will say exalted be He fa-yaqūlu; a variant has fa-naqūlu and We shall say’ to those who were worshipped as a way of establishing the argument against the worshippers of the former ‘Was it you read a-antum pronouncing both hamzas or by substituting the second one with an alif or not pronouncing this last and inserting an alif between the one not pronounced and the former or without such an insertion who misled these servants of Mine causing them to fall into error by commanding them to worship you or did they go astray from the way? the path of truth by themselves?"
  25,18,"They will say ‘Glory be to You — exalted be You above what does not befit You! It was not it would not have been right for us to take any guardians besides You that is other than You min awliyā’a the first direct object the min being extra added to emphasise the negation; the preceding min dūnika ‘besides You’ is the second direct object. So how can we command that we be worshipped? But You gave them and their fathers before them ease of living by granting them long life and abundant provision until they forgot the Remembrance until they became remiss about admonitions and belief in the Qur’ān and became a lost folk’ a folk destroyed. God exalted be He says"
  25,19,"Thus they will deny you that is the ones who were worshipped denied those who worshipped them in what you allege namely that they are gods and they will neither be able to read yastatī‘ūna or second person plural tastatī‘ūna in other words neither they nor you will be able to circumvent ward off the chastisement from you nor help nor protect you from it. And whoever of you does evil whoever ascribes partners to God We shall make him taste an awful a severe chastisement in the Hereafter."
  25,20,"And We did not send before you any messengers but that they ate food and walked in the marketplaces and so you are like them in this respect and truly what was said to them is being said to you. And We have made some of you a trial for others a test trying the rich with the poor the healthy with the sick the honourable with the vulgar in each case the latter would say ‘Why can I not be like the other person?’ Will you be steadfast? and endure what you hear from those with whom you are tried? the interrogative is meant as an imperative in other words ‘Be steadfast!’. And your Lord is ever Watchful of those who remain steadfast and those who become miserable."
