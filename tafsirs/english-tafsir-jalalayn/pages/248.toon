tafsir[8]{c,v,t}:
  12,104,"Nor do you ask them any wage that you should take for it that is for the Qur’ān — it namely the Qur’ān is but a reminder an admonition to all the worlds."
  12,105,"And how many a sign indicating the Oneness of God is there in the heavens and the earth which they pass by which they witness but disregard! not reflecting upon it."
  12,106,"And most of them do not believe in God such that they might affirm that He is the Creator and the Sustainer without ascribing partners to Him by worshipping idols; which is why when crying their ritual response to God they used to say ‘At Your service no partner have You save a partner that belongs to You; You possess him and all that he possesses’ meaning it when they said it."
  12,107,"Do they deem themselves secure from the coming upon them of a pall a calamity enveloping them of God’s chastisement or the coming of the Hour upon them suddenly while they are unaware? of the time of its arrival beforehand?"
  12,108,"Say to them ‘This is my way — which He explains by saying I call to the religion of God being upon sure knowledge plain proof I and whoever follows me whoever believes in me man ittaba‘anī is a supplement to anā ‘I’ the subject predicated by what preceded sc. ‘being upon sure knowledge’. So Glory be to God! in affirmation of His being exalted high above having partners and I am not of the idolaters’ — this sentence is also subsumed by the explanation of his statement about ‘his way’."
  12,109,"And We did not send before you any messengers save men inspired by revelation yūhā ilayhim a variant reading has nūhī ilayhim ‘to whom We revealed’ — and not angels — from among the people of the towns the principal towns since they are more knowledgeable and wiser than the people of the desert who are crude and ignorant. Have they the people of Mecca not travelled in the land and seen the nature of the consequence for those who were before them? that is how they ended up when they were destroyed for denying their messengers? And verily the abode of the Hereafter that is Paradise is better for those who are wary of God. Will they not understand? read a-fa-lā ya‘qilūn or a-fa-lā ta‘qilūn. ‘Will you not understand?’ this O people of Mecca and so have faith?"
  12,110,"Until hattā indicates the end result indicated by the previous statement wa-mā arsalnā min qablika illā rijālan And We did not send before you any messengers save men above Q. 12109 that is to whom Our support waned until when the messengers despaired and thought when the messengers were certain that they were denied read kudhdhibū to mean that they were denied to such an extent that they believed that there would not be any possible acceptance of faith thereafter; or read kudhibū to mean that the communities thought that their messengers had been lied to concerning the victory which they had been promised Our help came to them and whomever We willed We delivered read fa-nunajjī or fa-nunjī; or fa-nujjiya as past tense ‘whomever We wished was delivered’. And Our wrath Our chastisement cannot be averted from the sinning the idolatrous folk."
  12,111,"Verily there is in their stories that is the messengers’ stories a lesson for people of pith possessors of intellect. It this Qur’ān is not a fabricated an invented discourse but it is a confirmation of what was revealed before it of scriptures and a detailing an elucidation of everything that one needs for the proper observance of religion and a guidance from error and a mercy for a folk who believe such folk are singled out for mention because they are the ones to benefit from it to the exclusion of others."
