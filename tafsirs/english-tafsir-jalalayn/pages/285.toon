tafsir[11]{c,v,t}:
  17,28,"But if you have to overlook them that is the kinsmen and the others mentioned and do not give to them seeking mercy from your Lord a mercy which you expect in the future that is you do not give to them because of a request for provision which you are waiting to come to you from your Lord before you give to them then speak to them gentle words pleasant and reasonable words promising them that you will give to them when the provision from God arrives."
  17,29,"And do not keep your hand chained to your neck in other words do not withhold it completely from expending nor open it in order to expend completely or you will sit blameworthy — this refers to the first case — and denuded cut off having nothing — this refers to the latter case."
  17,30,"Truly your Lord expands provision He makes it abundant for whomever He will and He straitens He restricts it for whomever He will. Indeed He is ever Aware and Seer of His servants Knower of what they hide and what they manifest giving them provision in accordance with their welfare."
  17,31,"And do not slay your children by burying them alive fearing penury poverty. We shall provide for them and for you. Slaying them is truly a great sin."
  17,32,"And do not come anywhere near fornication — this form of expressing it is more effective than saying ‘Do not commit it’. It is indeed an indecency an abomination and it is an evil way."
  17,33,"And do not slay the soul whose life God has made inviolable except with due cause. Whoever is slain wrongfully We have certainly given his heir the one inheriting from him a warrant a sanction to retaliate against the slayer; but let him not commit excess let him not overstep the bounds in slaying by slaying other than the killer of the one slain or by other than that instrument with which he the slain was killed; for he is supported by the Law."
  17,34,"And do not come anywhere near an orphan’s property except in the fairest manner until he comes of age. And fulfil the covenant should you make a covenant with God or with people in general. Indeed the covenant will be enquired into."
  17,35,"And give full measure complete it when you measure and weigh with a right balance with an even balance that is better and fairer in return."
  17,36,"And do not pursue that of which you have no knowledge. Indeed the hearing and the sight and the heart — of each of these it will be asked of that person what he did with them."
  17,37,"And do not walk in the earth exultantly that is exultant with pride and conceit. Indeed you will not rend the earth you will not pierce it and reach its depths with your pride nor attain the mountains in height the meaning is that you shall never attain such ends so how can you be so arrogant?"
  17,38,"All of that which has been mentioned — the evil of it is hateful in the sight of your Lord."
