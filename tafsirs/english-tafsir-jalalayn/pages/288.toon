tafsir[8]{c,v,t}:
  17,59,"Nothing prevented Us from sending the signs requested by the people of Mecca except that the ancients denied them when We sent such signs and so We destroyed them if We were to send them to these people of Mecca they would deny them and would thus deserve destruction. However We have judged that they be given respite so that the mission of Muhammad (s) be completed. And We gave Thamūd the she-camel as a sign that was apparent one that was clear and evident but they wronged they disbelieved it and were therefore destroyed. And We do not send signs miracles except for deterrence to servants so that they might believe."
  17,60,"And remember when We said to you ‘Truly your Lord encompasses mankind’ in knowledge and power over them such that they are within His grasp so deliver the Message to them and do not fear anyone because God will protect you from them. And We did not appoint the vision that We showed you before your very eyes during the Night Journey except as a test for people for the people of Mecca — since they denied it and some of them even apostatised when he the Prophet informed them of it — and likewise the tree cursed in the Qur’ān namely the tree called Zaqqūm Q.3762ff that issues from the very root of the Blazing Fire of Hell; We made it a test for them because they said ‘Fire consumes trees so how can it cause it the Zaqqūm tree to issue forth?’. And We seek to deter them with it but it Our deterrence only increases them in gross insolence."
  17,61,"And mention when We said to the angels ‘Prostrate yourselves before Adam’ a prostration of salutation by inclining oneself and so they all prostrated themselves except Iblīs he said ‘Shall I prostrate myself before one whom You have created from clay?’ tīnan is in the accusative because the operator of the oblique min ‘of’ has been omitted in other words it would normally be min tīnin."
  17,62,"Said he ‘Do You see — in other words inform me this one whom You have honoured whom You have preferred above me? by commanding that prostration should be made before him when ‘I am better than him. You created me from fire while him You created from clay’ Q. 712. If la-in the lām is for oaths You defer me to the Day of Resurrection I shall verily eradicate his seed by leading them astray all save a few’ of them of those whom You have given divine protection."
  17,63,"Said He exalted be He to him Iblīs ‘Begone deferred to the time of the First Blast of the Trumpet. Whoever of them follows you — indeed Hell shall be your requital both yours and theirs a requital that is indeed ample sufficient and complete."
  17,64,"And tempt dupe whomever of them you can with your voice by your calling them with songs and pipes and with every invitation to acts of disobedience; and rally incite against them your cavalry and your infantry namely those who ride and walk in acts of disobedience and share with them in wealth that is illicit such as usury and extortion and children from acts of adultery and make promises to them’ to the effect that there will not be any resurrection or requital. And Satan promises them thereby nothing but delusion falsehood."
  17,65,"‘Truly as for My servants the believers you shall have no warrant’ no sway or ability. And Your Lord suffices as a guardian as a protector for them against you."
  17,66,"Your Lord is He Who drives for you the ships upon the sea that you may seek of His bounty exalted be He through engaging in commerce. Truly He is ever Merciful towards you by disposing these ships for you."
