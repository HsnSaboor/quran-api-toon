That namely Paradise is the reward the sequel of those who were wary of idolatry and the requital of the disbelievers is the Fire!"
  13,36,"And those to whom We have given the Scripture such as ‘Abd Allāh b. Salām and others from among the believing Jews rejoice in that which has been revealed to you because of its according with what they have with them of revelation; and among the factions that aligned themselves against you in enmity from among the idolaters and the Jews are those who reject some of it such as the mention of the ‘Compassionate One’ al-Rahmān and all that is other than the stories related therein. Say ‘I have been commanded — in that which has been revealed to me — only to worship God and not to associate anything with Him. To Him I call and to Him shall be my return’."
  13,37,"And so just like that manner of revelation We have revealed it that is the Qur’ān as a decisive judgement in Arabic in the language of the Arabs for you to judge thereby between people. And if you should follow their whims that is those of the disbelievers in that to which they summon you of their creed hypothetically speaking after what has come to you of knowledge of God’s Oneness you shall have no protector to assist you against God mina’Llāhi min the second min is extra and no defender to ward off His chastisement."
  13,38,"And when they derided him for having many wives the following was revealed And indeed We sent messengers before you and We assigned to them wives and seed children — and you are like them; and it was not for any Messenger from among them that he should bring a sign save by God’s leave because they are servants enthralled by Him. For every term period there is a Book wherein is inscribed its delimitation."
  13,39,"God effaces of it the Book whatever He will and He fixes read yuthbit or yuthabbit therein whatever He will of rulings or other matters and with Him is the Mother of the Book its source of origin of which nothing is ever changed and which consists of what He inscribed in pre-eternity azal."
  13,40,"And whether read as immā the nūn of the conditional particle in ‘whether’ has been assimiliated with the extra mā We show you a part of that which We promise them of chastisement during your lifetime the response of the conditional statement has been omitted in other words understand it as being fa-dhāk ‘then so shall it be’; or We take you to Us before chastising them; it is for you only to convey the Message your duty is only to deliver the Message and it is for Us to do the reckoning when they finally come to Us whereupon We shall requite them."
  13,41,"Or is it that they the people of Mecca have not seen how We visit the land how We target their land diminishing it at its outlying regions? by giving victory to the Prophet s. And God judges among His creatures as He will; there is none that can repel His judgement and He is swift at reckoning."
  13,42,"And indeed those that were before them of communities plotted against their prophets just as they plot against you; but to God belongs all plotting. And nor is their plotting like the plotting of God for exalted be He He knows what every soul earns and so its requital is prepared for it and this is the ultimate plotting since He brings it to them whence they are not aware. The disbeliever the genus is meant here; a variant reading has kuffār ‘the disbelievers’ shall assuredly know for whom shall be the sequel of the heavenly Abode that is the praiseworthy sequel in the abode of the Hereafter will it be theirs or that of the Prophet s and his Companions?"
