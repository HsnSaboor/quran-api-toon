tafsir[5]{c,v,t}:
  66,8,"O you who believe! Repent to God with sincere repentance read nasūhan or nusūhan a truthful repentance so that one does not return to committing that sin again nor have the desire to return to it. It may be that your Lord ‘asā an expression denoting ‘a hope’ that will be realised will absolve you of your misdeeds and admit you into gardens orchards underneath which rivers flow on the day when God will not let down by admitting into the Fire the Prophet and those who believe with him. Their light will be running before them in front of them and it will be on their right. They will say yaqūlūna this denotes the beginning of a new syntactically independent sentence ‘Our Lord! Perfect our light for us towards Paradise — whereas the hypocrites their light will be extinguished — and forgive us Our Lord. Assuredly You have power over all things’."
  66,9,"O Prophet! Struggle against the disbelievers with the sword and the hypocrites by the tongue and with argument and be stern with them in rebuke and hatred. For their abode will be Hell — and what an evil journey’s end! it is."
  66,10,"God has struck a similitude for those who disbelieve the wife of Noah and the wife of Lot. They were under two of Our righteous servants yet they betrayed them in their religion for they both disbelieved — Noah’s wife called Wāhila used to say to his people that he was a madman while Lot’s wife called Wā‘ila used to tell his people the whereabouts of his guests when they stayed with him at night by lighting a fire and during the day by making smoke. So they that is Noah and Lot did not avail the two women in any way against God against His chastisement and it was said to the two women ‘Enter both of you the Fire along with the incomers’ from among the disbelievers of the peoples of Noah and Lot."
  66,11,"And God has struck a similitude for those who believe the wife of Pharaoh — she believed in Moses her name was Āsiya; Pharaoh chastised her by tying her hands and feet to pegs and placing a huge millstone on her chest and having her laid out in the sun; but when those in charge of her would leave her the angels would come to shade her — when she said during her torture ‘My Lord build for me a home near You in Paradise — so He disclosed for her a veil of the Unseen and she saw it which in turn alleviated for her the torture — and deliver me from Pharaoh and his work his torture and deliver me from the evildoing folk’ the followers of his Pharaoh’s religion whereat God took unto Himself her spirit in death. Ibn Kaysān said ‘She was raised to Paradise alive where she eats and drinks’."
  66,12,"And Mary wa-Maryama is a supplement to imra’ata Fir‘awna daughter of ‘Imrān who preserved the chastity of her womb so We breathed into it of Our Spirit namely Gabriel — when he breathed into the opening of her shirt by God’s creation of this action of his which reached her womb thus conceiving Jesus — and she confirmed the words of her Lord His prescriptions and His revealed Scriptures and she was of the obedient one of the obedient folk."
