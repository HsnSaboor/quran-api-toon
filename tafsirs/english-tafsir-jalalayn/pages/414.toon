tafsir[6]{c,v,t}:
  31,29,"Have you not seen have you not realised O you being addressed that God makes the night pass into the day and makes the day pass into the night such that the increase of the one is relative to the decrease of the other and He has disposed the sun and the moon each of the two running in its course to an appointed term namely to the Day of Resurrection and that God is Aware of what you do?"
  31,30,"That which is mentioned is so because God He is the Truth the established truth and whatever they call on read yad‘ūna; or tad‘ūna ‘you call on’ whatever they worship besides Him is evanescent falsehood and because God is the High Exalted above His creation by virtue of His subjugation of them the Great the Mighty."
  31,31,"Have you not seen that the ships run upon the sea by the grace of God that He may show you O you who are being addressed in this statement some of His signs? Surely in that there are signs lessons for every servant who is steadfast in abstaining from acts of disobedience to God grateful for His grace."
  31,32,"And if waves cover them that is if these rise above the disbelievers like awnings like mountains that act as awnings over those below them they call on God sincere before Him in their faith that is in their supplication that He may deliver them in other words they do not call on any other god with Him; but when He delivers them to land some of them compromise middling between belief and disbelief while others persist in their disbelief. And none denies Our signs an example of which is Our delivering them from such treacherous waves except every perfidious ingrate ungrateful for God’s graces exalted be He."
  31,33,"O people namely such as the people of Mecca fear your Lord and fear a day when no parent shall avail a child thereon in any way; and no child thereon shall avail its parent in any way. Surely God’s promise of resurrection is true. So do not let the life of this world deceive you and divert you from Islam and do not let the Deceiver Satan deceive you concerning God because of His forbearance and granting people respite."
  31,34,"Lo! God with Him lies knowledge of the Hour when it will come to pass; and He sends down read yunzilu or yunazzilu the rain at times which only He knows; and He knows what is in the wombs whether it is a male or a female; and not one of the three things is known by anyone other than God exalted be He. And no soul knows what it will earn tomorrow of good or evil but God exalted be He knows this; and no soul knows in what land it will die but God exalted be He knows this. Truly God is Knower of all things Aware of the inward and outward aspects thereof. Al-Bukhārī reported by way of an isnād from ‘Abd Allāh Ibn ‘Umar the following hadīth ‘The Keys of the Unseen are five Lo! God with Him lies knowledge of the Hour … to the end of the sūra’ above."
