tafsir[5]{c,v,t}:
  9,118,"And He relented to the three who were left behind formerly denied His relenting to them for the same reason as those mentioned above when the earth was straitened for them for all its breadth that is despite its vastness so they could find no place wherein to feel secure and their souls that is their hearts were straitened for them because of the anxiety and their sense of alienation resulting from the delay of God’s relenting to them with mercy such that they their souls could not find happiness or solace; until they thought they were certain that read the softened an there is no refuge from God except in Him. Then He turned relenting to them He made them successful in finding repentance that they might also turn in repentance. Truly God is the Relenting the Merciful."
  9,119,"O you who believe fear God by refraining from acts of disobedience to Him and be with those who are truthful in their faith and covenants by adhering to sincerity."
  9,120,"It is not for the people of Medina and for the Bedouins who dwell around them to stay behind God’s Messenger when he sets out on a campaign and to prefer their lives to his life by guarding them against hardships which he the Prophet is content to suffer himself this statement is a prohibition expressed as a predicate; that prohibition against staying behind is because neither thirst nor toil nor hunger afflicts them in the way of God nor tread they any tread mawti’an is a verbal noun meaning wat’an that enrages the disbelievers nor gain any gain from the enemy of God be it through slaughter capture or plunder but a righteous deed is therefore recorded for them that they may be rewarded for it. Truly God does not leave the wage of the virtuous to go to waste that is the wage of those mentioned rather He rewards them."
  9,121,"Nor expend they therein in the way of God any sum small even if it be a single date or great nor do they cross a valley during a campaign march but it is recorded for them as a righteous deed that God may reward them the best of what they used to do that is the due reward thereof."
  9,122,"When the Prophet s was about to dispatch a raiding party — after they certain Muslims had been reproached for staying behind — all of them went forth and so the following was revealed It is not for the believers to go forth on a raid altogether why should not a party a group of every section of every tribe of them go forth while the others remain behind so that they those who remain behind may become learned in religion and that they may warn their folk when they return to them from the raid by teaching them some of the rulings which they have come to learn so that they may beware? of God’s punishment by adhering to His commands and prohibitions. Ibn ‘Abbās said that this verse is specifically intended for raiding parties while the previous one is specifically to prohibit any individual staying behind when the Prophet s sets out on a campaign."
