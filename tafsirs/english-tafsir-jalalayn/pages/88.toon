tafsir[6]{c,v,t}:
  4,60,"The following verse was revealed when a Jew and a hypocrite fell into a dispute. The hypocrite called on Ka‘b b. al-Ashraf to arbitrate between them while the Jew called on the Prophet s. When they came to him the Prophet ruled in favour of the Jew. But the hypocrite was not satisfied and so they went before ‘Umar. The Jew told him what had happened whereupon he ‘Umar turned to the hypocrite and asked him ‘Is this true?’ and when he replied ‘Yes’ he ‘Umar killed him. Have you not seen those who claim that they believe in what has been revealed to you and what was revealed before you desiring to take their disputes to a false deity tāghūt one excessive in tempting others to falsehood tughyān namely Ka‘b b. al-Ashraf when they have been commanded to renounce him? and not to associate with him. But Satan desires to mislead them far astray from the truth."
  4,61,"And when it is said to them ‘Come to what God has revealed as regards rulings in the Qur’ān and the Messenger’ that he may judge between you you see the hypocrites turn away from you vehemently to others."
  4,62,"How would it be what would they do when an affliction a punishment befalls them for what their own hands have sent before them of unbelief and acts of disobedience that is to say would they then be able to turn away and escape it? No! They then come to you thumma jā’ūka a supplement to yasuddūn ‘they turn away’ of the previous verse swearing by God that in turning to other than you for arbitration ‘We sought only virtue settlement and harmony’ reconciliation between the disputing parties by any approximate judgement without regard for the painful truth."
  4,63,"Those — God knows what is in their hearts in the way of hypocrisy and the mendacity of their excuses; so turn away from them with forgiveness and admonish them make them fear God and say to them regarding the issue of their souls penetrating words affecting them in other words reprimand them so that they repent of their unbelief."
  4,64,"We never sent any Messenger but that he should be obeyed in what he commands and judges by the leave by the command of God and not that he should be disobeyed or opposed. If when they had wronged themselves by seeking the judgement of the false idol they had come to you repentant and asked forgiveness from God and the Messenger had asked forgiveness for them there is a shift from the second to the third person in this address in deference to his the Prophet’s s status; they would have found God Relenting to them Merciful to them."
  4,65,"But no fa-lā the lā is extra by your Lord! They will not believe until they make you judge over what has broken out has become mixed up between them and find in themselves no inhibition no constraint or doubt regarding what you decide but submit but comply with your ruling in full submission without objection."
