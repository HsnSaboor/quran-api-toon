tafsir[7]{c,v,t}:
  9,41,"Go forth light and heavy! that is energetically or not; it is also said to mean go forth strong or weak or rich or poor — but this was abrogated by the verse The weak would not be at fault … Q. 991. Struggle in the way of God with your possessions and your lives that is better for you if only you knew that it is better for you; so do not sink down heavily."
  9,42,"The following was revealed regarding the hypocrites who stayed behind away from the campaign Had it — that to which you summon them — been a near easily acquired gain a transient pleasure of this world and an easy journey of moderate length they would have followed you seeking spoils; but the distance the hardship was too great for them and so they stayed behind. Still they will swear by God when you return to them saying ‘Had we been able to go forth we would have gone forth with you’ destroying their souls by swearing false oaths and God knows that they truly are liars in this saying of theirs."
  9,43,"The Prophet s exercising his personal judgement had given leave to a group to stay behind and so the following was revealed as a reprimand for him but with the pardon first in order to reassure his heart May God pardon you! Why do you give them leave to stay behind; why did you not leave them until it was clear to you which of them spoke the truth in their excuse and you knew those who were lying in it?"
  9,44,"Those who believe in God and the Last Day do not ask leave of you to stay behind that they may struggle with their possessions and their lives; and God knows the pious."
  9,45,"They alone ask leave of you to stay behind who do not believe in God and the Last Day and whose hearts are doubtful uncertain about religion so in their doubt they waver they are confused."
  9,46,"If they had desired to go forth with you they would have made some preparation for it some equipment such as tools and provisions but God was averse that they should be sent forth that is He did not want them to go forth so He slowed them down He made them feel lethargic and it was said to them ‘Stay back with those who stay back!’ with the sick the women and the children in other words God decreed this."
  9,47,"Had they gone forth among you they would only have caused you more trouble more corruption by abandoning the believers and would have hurried to and fro among you that is they would have hastened to spread slander among you seeking desiring to stir up sedition by casting enmity between you; and among you there are some who would listen to them to what they say listening in readiness to accept it; and God knows the evildoers."
