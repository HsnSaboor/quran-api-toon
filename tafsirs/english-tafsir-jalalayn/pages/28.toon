tafsir[5]{c,v,t}:
  2,182,"But if any one fears injustice an error in straying from what is right or sin because he has purposely increased the share of a third or specified a rich individual from one making testament read mūsī or muwassī and so makes things right between them the testator and the trustee by commanding that justice be done then no sin shall be upon him with regard to this matter; surely God is Forgiving Merciful."
  2,183,"O you who believe prescribed for you obligatory for you is the Fast just as it was prescribed for those communities that were before you so that you might guard yourselves against acts of disobedience for it the fast curbs the desires that prompt these acts."
  2,184,"For days ayyāman ‘days’ is in the accusative as the object of al-siyām ‘the fast’ or of an implied yasūmū ‘he fasts’ numbered few or specific in number that is those of Ramadān as will be mentioned below; God has specified a small number as a way of facilitating matters for those under the obligation; and if any of you during the month be sick or be on a journey in which prayers are shortened or if one is strained by the fast in both cases and breaks it then a number of other days equal to the ones during which he broke his fast — let him fast them instead; and for those who are not able to do it to fast on account of old age or chronic illness a redemption which is the feeding of a poor man with about the same amount one consumes in a given day that is one mudd measure of the principal food of that town each day a variant reading has genitive fidyatin as an explicative clause. It is also said that the lā negation of the verb yutīqūnahu is not actually implied because at the very beginning of Islam they could choose between fasting or offering the redemption; but later on this was abrogated by fixing the Fast as an obligation where God says So let those of you who are present at the month fast it Q. 2185 Ibn ‘Abbās said by way of qualification ‘Except for the pregnant one and the one breastfeeding if they break their fast out of concern for the child; in the case of these two the verse remains valid and has not been abrogated’. For him who volunteers good by offering more than the minimum amount mentioned for the redemption; that volunteering is good for him; but that you should fast wa-an tasūmū is the subject is better for you khayrun lakum is its predicate than breaking the fast and paying the redemption if you but knew that this is better for you then do it."
  2,185,"These days of the month of Ramadān wherein the Qur’ān was revealed from the Preserved Tablet to the earthly heaven on the Night of Ordainment laylat al-qadr from Him a guidance hudan ‘a guidance’ is a circumstantial qualifier guiding away from error for the people and as clear proofs lucid verses of the Guidance the rulings that guide to truth and of the Criterion that discriminates between truth and falsehood; So let those of you who are present at the month fast it and if any of you be sick or if he be on a journey then a number of other days this concession has already been mentioned but it is repeated here to avoid the mistaken impression that it has been abrogated by the comprehensive implication of man shahida ‘who are present’. God desires ease for you and desires not hardship for you and for this reason He has permitted you the breaking of the fast during illness or travel this ease being the very reason He has commanded you to fast; He supplements the previous statement with and that you fulfil read tukmilū or tukammilū the number of the fasting days of Ramadān and magnify God when you have completed them for having guided you for having directed you to the principal rites of His religion and that you might be thankful to God for this."
  2,186,"A group of followers of the Prophet s asked him ‘Is our Lord nearby so that we should talk to Him secretly or is He far away so that we should call out to him?’ and the following was revealed And when My servants question you concerning Me — I am near to them in My knowledge and he informed them of this; I answer the call of the caller by granting him his request when he calls to Me; so let them respond to Me My call to them to be obedient and let them believe let them persevere in faith in Me that they might go aright that they might become guided."
