tafsir[7]{c,v,t}:
  40,34,"And verily Joseph brought you before in other words before Moses — according to one opinion this Joseph is the son of Jacob having been given life until the time of Moses; according to another opinion this is Joseph son of Abraham son of Joseph son of Jacob — clear signs manifest miracles but you continued to be in doubt concerning what he had brought you until when he died you said without any evidence to support such a claim “God will never send any messenger after him” — in other words you will never cease to disbelieve in Joseph and others that may come after him. So that is just as you have been led astray God leads astray one who is a prodigal an idolater a skeptic’ a doubter of that which the clear signs have certified."
  40,35,"Those who dispute the signs of God His miracles alladhīna yujādilūna fī āyāti’Llāhi the subject without any warrant any evidence that has come to them — greatly hateful is that disputing of theirs kabura the predicate of the subject in the sight of God and in the sight of those who believe. So just as they have been led astray God sets a seal of misguidance on the heart of every arrogant tyrant read qalbin ‘the heart of’ with nunation or without qalbi. As the heart grows arrogant so does the individual and vice versa kulli in both readings is meant to indicate the totality of the misguidance of such hearts not the totality of the hearts."
  40,36,"And Pharaoh said ‘O Hāmān! Build for me a tower a lofty edifice that perhaps I may reach the routes —"
  40,37,"the routes of the heavens — the paths that lead to it and look upon read indicative fa-attali‘u as a supplement to ablughu ‘I may reach’; or read subjunctive fa-attali‘a as the response to ibni lī ‘build for me’ the God of Moses; for I truly think that he that is Moses is lying’ about his having a god other than me — Pharaoh said this in order to disguise the truth. And that is how the evil nature of his conduct was made to seem fair to Pharaoh and that is how he was barred from the right way the path to guidance read sadda ‘that is how he barred others’ or sudda ‘that is how he was barred’. And Pharaoh’s guile ended only in ruin loss."
  40,38,"And he who believed ‘O my people! Follow me read ittabi‘ūnī with the final long yā’ or ittabi‘ūni without; I will guide you to the way of rectitude a similar statement has already been mentioned verse 29 above."
  40,39,"O my people! Truly this life of the world is only an ephemeral enjoyment containing comforts which will eventually disappear whereas the Hereafter truly is the enduring abode."
  40,40,"Whoever commits an evil deed shall not be requited except with the like of it; but whoever acts righteously whether male or female and is a believer — such shall be admitted into Paradise read passive yudkhalūna or the opposite active yadkhulūna ‘they shall enter’ wherein they will be provided without any reckoning an abundant provision given to them unconditionally."
