tafsir[7]{c,v,t}:
  4,141,"Those who alladhīna substitutes for the previous alladhīna of verse 139 wait in watch for you hoping for misfortunes to befall you and if a victory such as a conquest or booty comes to you from God say to you ‘Were we not with you?’ in religion and in the struggle? So give us from the booty; but if the disbelievers have some luck by gaining a victory over you they say to them ‘Did we not gain mastery authority over you capable of capturing you and slaying you but we spared you and did we not defend you against the believers?’ lest they be victorious over you by forsaking them and apprising you of their plans and thus have we not done you a favour? God exalted be He says God will judge between you and them on the Day of Resurrection admitting you into Paradise and them into the Fire; and God will never grant the disbelievers a way a means to success over the believers by annihilating them."
  4,142,"The hypocrites seek to trick God by manifesting the opposite of what they hide in themselves of unbelief in order to escape His rulings in this world; but He is tricking them He will requite them for their trickery and so they will be disgraced in this world through God apprising His Prophet of what they hide and punished in the Hereafter. When they stand up to pray with the believers they stand up lazily reluctantly and for their prayers to be seen by people and they do not remember pray to God save a little for ostentation."
  4,143,"Wavering hesitant all the time between that unbelief and belief — not belonging to these disbelievers neither to those believers; and he whom God sends astray you will never find for him a way a path back to guidance."
  4,144,"O you who believe take not the disbelievers as friends instead of the believers do you desire to give God over you by your taking them as friends a clear warrant? a manifest proof of your hypocrisy?"
  4,145,"Verily the hypocrites will be in the lowest level place of the Fire that is its bottom; and you will never find a helper for them anyone to guard them from the Fire."
  4,146,"Save those who repent of hypocrisy and make amends in their deeds and hold fast to put their trust in God and make their religion purely God’s free from any pretence; those are with the believers in terms of what they shall be given; and God will certainly give the believers a great wage in the Hereafter and that is Paradise."
  4,147,"Why would God chastise you if you are thankful of His favours and believe in Him? the interrogative is meant as a denial in other words He would not punish you. God is ever Thankful of the deeds of believers rewarding them Knowing of His creation."
