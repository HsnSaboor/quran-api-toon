  31,12,"And verily We gave Luqmān wisdom comprising knowledge religiousness and right-mindedness in speech; his many wisdoms are well-known. He used to give legal opinions in matters of religion before David was summoned to prophethood but lived on into the latter’s summoning. He then took to acquiring knowledge from him David and refrained from giving any more legal opinions explaining this thus ‘Should I not be content if someone like the prophet David has spared me the trouble?’ He was once asked ‘What is the worst kind of person?’ He said ‘The one who does not care that people should see him doing evil’. In other words We gave him wisdom and We said to him ‘Give thanks to God for the wisdom that He has given you. Whoever gives thanks only for his own sake because the reward for his gratitude shall be his and whoever is ungrateful for a grace then surely God is Independent without need of His creation Praised’ in what He does."
  31,13,"And mention when Luqmān said to his son when he was admonishing him ‘O my son yā bunayya is an affectionate diminutive of yā ibnī do not ascribe partners to God idolatry is truly a tremendous wrong’ so return to him in repentance and submit to Him."
  31,14,"And We have enjoined man concerning his parents We commanded him to be dutiful towards them — his mother bears him and weakens in weakness after weakness that is to say she is weakened by the pregnancy the pains of labour and the delivery; and his weaning is in two years and We said to him to man ‘Give thanks to Me and to your parents. To Me is the journey’s end the return."
  31,15,"But if they urge you to ascribe to Me as partner that whereof you have no knowledge that accords with any reality then do not obey them. And keep them company in this world honourably in other words with decency dutifulness and kindness — and follow the way of him who returns to Me in penitence with acts of obedience. Then to Me will be your return and I will inform you of what you used to do and requite you for it the entire sentence containing the ‘enjoinder’ verse 14 and what comes after it constitutes a parenthetical statement."
  31,16,"‘O my son! Even if it namely the evil trait should be the weight of a grain of mustard-seed and even if it be in a rock or in the heavens or in the earth in other words in the most concealed place therein God will bring it forth and He will call that person to account for it. Truly God is Subtle in bringing it forth Aware of its location."
  31,17,"O my son! Establish prayer and enjoin decency and forbid indecency. And be patient through whatever may befall you as a result of such enjoining and forbidding. Truly that which is mentioned is true constancy in other words that is one of those necessary things regarding which one must have firm resolve."
  31,18,"And do not turn your cheek disdainfully from people tusa‘‘ir a variant reading has tusā‘ir do not turn your face away in disdain and do not walk upon the earth exultantly in other words with haughtiness. Truly God does not like any swaggering braggart strutting in his step boasting in front of people."
  31,19,"And be modest in your bearing being moderate in it neither dragging slowly nor rushing but peaceful and dignified and lower your voice; indeed the most hideous of voices is the donkey’s voice’ beginning its hideous bray with an exhalation and ending with an inhalation."
