He said ‘Did I not say to you “Indeed I know from God what you do not know?” ’"
  12,97,"They said ‘O our father ask forgiveness for us of our sins; truly we have been sinful’."
  12,98,"He said ‘Assuredly I shall ask forgiveness for you of my Lord. Lo! He is the Forgiving the Merciful’ he Jacob put off this plea of forgiveness until the last hour before dawn in order to be closer to the likelihood of it being accepted or he put it off until the eve of Friday.

  12,99,"And when they entered to Joseph in his tent he took his parents his father and his mother — or and his maternal aunt — into his arms and said to them ‘Enter into Egypt if God will in safety’ and they entered and Joseph sat down on his throne."
  12,100,"And he raised his parents he seated them next to him upon the throne and they fell down that is his parents and brothers prostrating before him — a prostration that was actually a bowing down not placing their foreheads down on the ground; this was their standard form of greeting at that time. Then he said ‘O father this is the interpretation of my vision of old. Indeed my Lord has made it true. And indeed He has been gracious to me since He brought me out of the prison — he did not say ‘out of the well’ in a show of magnanimity lest his brothers feel ashamed — and has brought you from the desert after Satan had incited ill feeling made trouble between me and my brethren.

Take me in death to You in submission to You and join me to the righteous’ from among my fathers. He lived after that for another week or more. He died at the age of 120 years.
