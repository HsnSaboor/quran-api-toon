  39,15,"So worship whatever you wish besides Him’ other than Him — herein is a threat for them as well as a declaration of the fact that they do not worship God exalted be He. Say ‘Indeed the losers are those who will have lost their souls and their families on the Day of Resurrection by condemning their souls to abide forever in the Fire and their failure to attaining the bliss promised among the black-eyed virgins who would have been prepared for them in Paradise had they been believers. Truly that is the manifest loss!’"
  39,16,"Above them they will have canopies layers of fire and beneath them they will have similar canopies of fire.

God does not fail the tryst He does not break His promise."
  39,21,"Have you not seen realised that God sends down water from the heaven then conducts it as springs making it enter points of springs in the ground? Then with it He brings forth crops of diverse hues. Then they wither they become dried-out and you see them for example after having been green turning yellow. Then He turns them into chaff.
