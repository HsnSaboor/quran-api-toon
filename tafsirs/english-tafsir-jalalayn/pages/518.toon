  50,1,"Qāf God knows best what He means by this letter. By the glorious Qur’ān by the noble Qur’ān the disbelievers of Mecca have certainly not believed in Muhammad (s)."

  50,3,"What! read a-idhā pronouncing both hamzas or not pronouncing the second but inserting an alif between the two in both cases When we are dead and have become dust? shall we return to life? That is a far-fetched return!’ an event that is extremely remote."

  50,5,"Nay but they denied the truth the Qur’ān when it came to them and so they with regard to the Prophet s and the Qur’ān are now in a confounded situation a troubled one. For on one occasion they said that he was ‘A sorcerer!’ cf. Q. 384 and that his statements were ‘Nothing but manifest sorcery!’ cf. Q. 3715 on another ‘A poet!’ cf. Q. 215 and ‘Poetry!’ cf. Q. 3669 and still on another ‘A soothsayer!’ cf. Q. 5229 and that his statements were nothing more than soothsaying cf. Q. 6942."
  50,6,"Have they not then looked with their own eyes at the heaven being above them in order to take heed by their own minds of the consequences for them when they deny the Resurrection how We have built it without supports and adorned it with planets and how there are no cracks in it? no fissures blemishing it."
  50,7,"And the earth wa’l-arda is a supplement to the position of the words ilā l-samā’i ‘at the heaven’ how We have spread it out how We have rolled it across the face of the water and cast in it firm mountains to fix it in place and caused every delightful kind every delightful specimen causing delight by its very beauty to grow in it"
  50,8,"as an insight tabsiratan is a direct object denoting reason that is to say We did this to give an insight from Us and a reminder for every penitent servant who returns to obedience of Us."
  50,9,"And We send down from the heaven blessed water containing much blessing with which We cause to grow gardens orchards and the grain that is harvested"
  50,10,"and the date-palms that stand tall bāsiqātin is an implied future circumstantial qualifier with piled spathes one cluster of dates sitting on top of the other"
  50,11,"as provision for Our servants rizqan li’l-‘ibādi is a direct object denoting reason; and with it We revive a dead land baldatan may be followed equally by the masculine maytan or the feminine adjective maytatan. So like that manner of reviving shall be the rising from the graves so how can you deny it? the interrogative is meant as an affirmative; the meaning then is that they have indeed observed all of these things and are aware of what has been mentioned yet they disbelieve."
  50,12,"The people of Noah denied before them kadhdhabat has a feminine person inflection because of the feminine gender of the import of qawm ‘people’ and so did the dwellers at al-Rass — this was the name of a well around which they dwelt together with their livestock; they worshipped idols and it is said that their prophet was one Hanzala b.

Each of those mentioned denied the messengers as your tribe Quraysh have and so My threat became due the sending down of chastisement on all of them became incumbent so do not be anguished by Quraysh’s disbelieving in you."
  50,15,"Were We then wearied by the first creation? that is to say We were not wearied by it and likewise We will not be wearied by restoring it. Nay yet they are in doubt about a new creation which will be at the Resurrection."
