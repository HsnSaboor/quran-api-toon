  41,12,"Then He ordained them the suffixed pronoun refers back to al-samā’ ‘the heaven’ because it al-samā’ actually denotes that plural sense to which it will lead in the following clause in other words He made them to be seven heavens in two days — Thursday and Friday. He completed them in the last hour thereof in which He created Adam — which is why He does not say sawā’an ‘evenly’ here as He did earlier; what is said here concords with those verse in which it is stated that the heavens and the earth were created in six days; and in each heaven He revealed its commandment’ that to which He commanded those in it to follow in the way of obedience and worship. And We adorned the lowest heaven with lamps with stars and this was also to guard them hifzan is in the accusative because of its implicit verbal sense in other words ‘We guarded it against the devils lest they try to listen therein to the angels by stealth with meteors’. That is the ordaining of the Mighty in His kingdom the Knower of His creatures."
  41,13,"But if they that is the Meccan disbelievers turn away from belief after this clear statement then say ‘I warn you of I threaten you with a thunderbolt like the thunderbolt of ‘Ād and Thamūd’ in other words a chastisement that will destroy you like the one that destroyed them."
  41,14,"When the messengers came to them from in front of them and from behind them that is coming to them to warn them and leaving them behind as they departed but they disbelieved as will be stated shortly — the destruction of them meant would only take place in his time — saying ‘Worship none but God’ they said ‘Had our Lord willed He would have surely sent down to us angels; therefore we indeed disbelieve in what you according to your claim have been sent with!’"

  41,16,"So We unleashed upon them a raging wind cold and violent but without rain during some ill-fated days read nahisātin or nahsātin days that were calamitous for them that We might make them taste the chastisement of disgrace humiliation in the life of this world; yet the chastisement of the Hereafter is indeed more disgraceful more severe and they will not be helped to have it warded off from them."
  41,17,"And as for Thamūd We offered them guidance We pointed out to them the path of guidance but they preferred blindness they chose disbelief as opposed to guidance. So the thunderbolt of the humiliating chastisement seized them on account of what they used to earn."
  41,18,"And We delivered from it those who believed and feared God."
  41,19,"And mention the day when God’s enemies are gathered read either yuhsharu a‘dā’u’Llāhi or nahshuru a‘dā’a’Llāhi ‘when We gather God’s enemies’ to the Fire for they will be driven thereto"
  41,20,"until when they reach it idhā mā the mā is extra their hearing and their eyes and their skins will bear witness against them concerning what they used to do."
