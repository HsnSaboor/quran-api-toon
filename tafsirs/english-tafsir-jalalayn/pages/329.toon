  21,82,"And We disposed of the devils some that dived for him plunging into the sea and bringing out of it jewels for Solomon and performed tasks other than that that is other than diving such as building and otherwise. And We were watchful over them lest they should spoil what they had made for whenever they completed a task before nightfall they would invariably spoil it unless they were occupied with some other task."
  21,83,"And mention Job Ayyūba is substituted by the following idh nādā rabbahu … when he called out to his Lord — after he had been afflicted with the loss of all of his possessions and children the laceration of his body his being shunned by all except his wife for a period of thirteen seventeen or eighteen years as well as the affliction of enduring a straitened means of livelihood — ‘Indeed read annī because of the implicit yā’ of the first person pronoun harm adversity has befallen me and You are the Most Merciful of the merciful’."
  21,84,"So We responded to him in his call and removed the harm that had befallen him and We gave him back his family his male and female children by bringing them back to life — of each sex there were three or seven along with them other children the like of them from his wife for she was made younger. He had also possessed a threshing floor for wheat and another for barley so God sent two clouds and one of them poured forth gold onto the wheat threshing floor and the other poured forth silver onto the barley threshing floor until they overflowed; as a mercy rahmatan a direct object denoting reason from Us min ‘indinā an adjectival phrase and a reminder to worshippers that they be patient and thus be rewarded by God."
  21,85,"And mention Ishmael and Idrīs and Dhū’l-Kifl — all were of the patient in maintaining obedience to God and staying away from acts of disobedience to Him."
  21,86,"And We admitted them into Our mercy through granting them prophethood. Indeed they were among the worthy of it. Dhū’l-Kifl was so called because he undertook takaffala to fast every day and stay up every night in prayer and to pass judgement between people without succumbing to anger and fulfilled this undertaking. It is also said however that he was not a prophet."
  21,87,"And mention Dhū’l-Nūn the one of the whale namely Jonah son of Amittai Yūnus bin Mattā when he went off enraged Dhā’l-Nūn is substituted by the clause idh dhahaba mughādiban by his people that is furious with them because of what he had suffered at their hands — even though he had not been granted permission by God to go off as he did — thinking that We had no power over him that is that We could not compel him to submit to Our decree in the way that We did by imprisoning him inside the stomach of the whale; or that We could not make circumstances difficult for him. Then he cried out in the darknesses through the darkness of the night the darkness of the sea and the darkness of the whale’s stomach that ‘There is no god except You! Glory be to You! I have indeed been one of the wrongdoers’ for leaving my people without Your permission."
  21,88,"So We responded to him and delivered him from the distress by means of those words and thus in the same way that We delivered him We deliver the believers from their anguish when they call out to Us seeking succour."
  21,89,"And mention Zachariah Zakariyyā is substituted by the following idh nādā rabbahu … when he cried out to his Lord saying ‘My Lord do not leave me without an heir without a son to inherit from me and You are the best of inheritors’ the One that endures after all of your creation has perished."
  21,90,"So We responded to him in his call and gave him John as a son and We restored fertility to his wife for him and so she bore a child having been barren. Truly they those prophets that have been mentioned would hasten to they would hurry to perform good works namely acts of obedience and supplicate Us out of desire for Our mercy and in awe of Our chastisement and they were submissive before Us humble in their worship."
