tafsir[4]{c,v,t}:
  24,28,"And if you do not find anyone in them to give you permission still do not enter them until permission has been given to you. And if it is said to you when you are seeking permission ‘Go away’ then go away for this going away is purer that is better for you than sitting and waiting at the doorstep. And God knows what you do whether you enter with permission or without it and He will requite you for it."
  24,29,"You would not be at fault if you enter without permission uninhabited houses wherein is comfort some benefit for you in the way of finding shelter and so on as in the case of travellers inns and charitable hostels. And God knows what you disclose what you do openly and what you hide what you do secretly when entering houses other than your own be it for a righteous purpose or otherwise. It will be mentioned shortly that they should bid themselves peace when entering their own houses."
  24,30,"Tell believing men to lower their gaze from what is unlawful for them to look at min of min absārihim ‘their gaze’ is extra and to guard their private parts from doing with them what is unlawful for them to do. That is purer in other words better for them. Truly God is Aware of what they do with their gazes and private parts and He will requite them for it."
  24,31,"And tell believing women to lower their gaze away from what is not lawful for them to look at and to guard their private parts from what is not lawful for them to do with them and not to display their adornment except for what is apparent namely the face and the hands which may be seen by a stranger when there is no danger of either or both falling into temptation — this being one of two opinions. The second of these is that even this is forbidden because there is a presumption that these parts will cause temptation — and this is the preferred opinion if one must settle this topic with a definitive opinion; and let them draw their veils over their bosoms that is let them cover up their heads necks and chests with veils and not reveal their hidden adornment namely all that is other than the face and the hands except to their husbands bu‘ūl is the plural form of ba‘l ‘male spouse’ or their fathers or their husbands’ fathers or their sons or their husbands’ sons or their brothers or their brothers’ sons or their sisters’ sons or their women or what their right hands own all of whom are permitted to look thereat except for the part from the navel down to the knees which is unlawful for any other than their husbands to see; ‘their women’ however excludes disbelieving women for it is not permitted for Muslim women to reveal themselves to these; ‘what their right hands own’ comprises slaves; or such men who are dependant on what food may be left over not ghayri read as an adjective or read ghayra as an exceptive possessing any sexual desire not those men who are in sexual need of women so for example those whose male member cannot become erect; or children who are not yet aware of women’s private parts in the context of sexual intercourse and so to these they may reveal themselves except for that part from the navel to the knees. And do not let them thump with their feet to make known their hidden ornaments as in a rattling anklet and the like. And rally to God in repentance O believers repenting of the occasions on which you may have looked at what is forbidden to look at of such parts and otherwise so that you might be prosperous so that you might be saved from such sinful acts when your repentance thereof is accepted — in this verse the prevalent address is to males over females."
