tafsir[7]{c,v,t}:
  9,62,"They swear by God to you O believers that what has reached you of the Messenger being injured they did not do so that they might please you but God and His Messenger are more deserving that they should please them through obedience if they are true believers the merging of the pronouns into one in yurdūhu ‘their pleasing them’ is because the ‘pleasure’ of both God and His Messenger are mutually dependent; either that or it is because the predicate of Allāhu wa-rasūluhu ‘God and His Messenger’ has been omitted."
  9,63,"Do they not know that the fact is that whoever opposes God and His Messenger for him shall be the fire of Hell as a requital to abide therein? That is the great abasement."
  9,64,"The hypocrites are cautious they fear lest a sūra should be revealed to them that is to the believers informing them of what is in their the hypocrites’ hearts of hypocrisy and yet despite this they persist in mockery. Say ‘Keep mocking! this is an imperative of threat God will bring out He will make manifest that hypocrisy of yours of which you are fearful’ lest it be brought out."
  9,65,"And if la-in the lām is for oaths you question them about their mockery of you and of the Qur’ān while they were journeying with you towards Tabūk assuredly they will say making excuses ‘We were only engaging in idle talk and jesting’ in conversation in order to pass the time of the road and we did not mean it. Say to them ‘Were you then mocking God and His signs and His Messenger?"
  9,66,"Make no excuses for that. You have disbelieved after believing that is your disbelief has become manifest even as you have manifested belief. If We forgive read passive yu‘fa ‘it is forgiven’ or active first person plural na‘fu ‘We forgive’ a party of you because of its sincerity and its repentance as in the case of Jahsh b. Humayyir We will chastise read either passive tu‘adhdhab ‘it shall be chastised’ or nu‘adhdhib another party because they were sinners’ persisting in hypocrisy and mockery."
  9,67,"The hypocrites both men and women are of one another that is they resemble one another in religion as pieces of an individual entity they enjoin indecency unbelief and acts of disobedience and forbid decency faith and obedience; and they withhold their hands shut from expending in obedience of God; they have forgotten God they have abandoned obedience of Him so He has forgotten them He has deprived them of His grace. Truly the hypocrites they are the wicked."
  9,68,"God has promised the hypocrites both men and women and the disbelievers the fire of Hell to abide therein it will suffice them as a requital and a punishment. And God has cursed them He has removed them from His mercy and theirs will be a lasting perpetual chastisement."
