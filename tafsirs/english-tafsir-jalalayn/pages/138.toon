  6,82,"Those who believe and have not confounded mixed their belief with evildoing that is idolatry — explained as such by a hadīth in the two Sahīhs of Bukhārī and Muslim — theirs is security from chastisement; and they are rightly guided."
  6,83,"That tilka is the subject of the sentence and is substituted by the following hujjatunā argument of Ours with which Abraham inferred God’s Oneness as in the case of the setting stars and what came afterwards; the predicate is what follows We bestowed upon Abraham We guided him to it as an argument against his people. We raise up in degrees whom We will read this as a genitive annexation darajāti man nashā’ or as accusative nunation darajātin man nashā’ degrees in knowledge and wisdom; surely your Lord is Wise in His actions Knowing of His creation."
  6,84,"And We bestowed upon him Isaac and his son Jacob; each one of the two We guided. And Noah We guided before that is before Abraham and of his seed that is Noah’s seed David and his son Solomon and Job and Joseph son of Jacob and Moses and Aaron; and so in the same way that We have requited them We requite the virtuous."
  6,85,"And Zachariah and his son John and Jesus son of Mary — this shows that the term ‘seed’ dhurriyya can include offspring from the female side — and Elias the paternal nephew of Aaron brother of Moses; all of them were of the righteous."
  6,86,"And Ishmael son of Abraham and Elisha Ilyasa‘ the lām is extra and Jonah and Lot son of Hārān brother of Abraham all of them We preferred above all the worlds through prophethood."
  6,87,"And of their fathers and of their seed and of their brethren this clause is a supplement either to the previous kullan ‘all of them’ or to Nūhan ‘Noah’; min ‘of’ is partitive because some of them did not have offspring while others had disbelievers among their offspring; and We chose them and We guided them to a straight path."
  6,88,"That religion to which they were guided is God’s guidance wherewith He guides whom He will of His servants; had they hypothetically speaking been idolaters all that they did would have been in vain."
  6,89,"They are the ones to whom We gave the Scripture meaning the Books of God judgement wisdom and prophethood; so if these people of Mecca disbelieve therein that is in these three then indeed We have entrusted it to We have set aside for it a people who do not disbelieve in it namely the Emigrants Muhājirūn and the Helpers Ansār."
  6,90,"They are the ones whom God has guided; so follow their guidance their way of affirming God’s Oneness and of exercising patience read iqtadih ‘follow’ with the silent hā’ whether pausing or continuing the recitation; a variant reading omits it in continuous recitation. Say to the people of Mecca ‘I do not ask of you to give me any wage for it the Qur’ān; it the Qur’ān is only a reminder an admonition to all the worlds’ of mankind and jinn."
