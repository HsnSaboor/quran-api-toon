tafsir[7]{c,v,t}:
  4,148,"God does not like the utterance of evil words out loud by any person that is to say He will punish him for it unless a person has been wronged in which case He would not punish him for uttering it out loud when he is informing others of the wrong done to him by the wrong-doer or summoning them against him. God is ever Hearer of what is said Knower of what is done."
  4,149,"If you show manifest good in the way of pious deeds or conceal it if you do it in secret or pardon evil injustice then surely God is ever Pardoning Powerful."
  4,150,"Those who disbelieve in God and His messengers and seek to divide between God and His messengers by believing in Him but not in them and say ‘We believe in some of the messengers and disbelieve in some’ of the others and seek to adopt a way a path to follow between them between unbelief and belief."
  4,151,"Those are the disbelievers truly haqqan is the verbal noun emphasising the content of what precedes it in the sentence; and We have prepared for the disbelievers a humiliating chastisement namely the chastisement of the Fire."
  4,152,"And those who believe in God and all of His messengers and do not seek to divide between any of them those — We shall surely give them nu’tīhim also read yu’tīhim ‘He shall surely give them’ their wages the reward for their deeds. God is ever Forgiving to His friends Merciful to those who obey Him."
  4,153,"The People of the Scripture the Jews will ask of you O Muhammad (s) to cause a Book to be revealed to them from the heaven all at once as was revealed to Moses merely to harass you. If you consider this shocking then know that they their forefathers asked Moses for something greater than that for they said ‘Show us God openly’ before our eyes; so the thunderbolt death seized them as punishment for them for their evildoing when they harassed him Moses with this demand. They then took to themselves the golden calf for a god after clear proofs the miracles testifying to God’s Oneness had come to them; yet We pardoned that and did not annihilate them; and We bestowed upon Moses clear authority evident and manifest sway over them for when he commanded them to slay themselves in repentance they obeyed him."
  4,154,"And We raised above them the Mount by the covenant with them that is on account of the covenant made with them that they might fear and so they accepted it; and We said to them while it cast a shadow hovering above them ‘Enter the gate the gate of the town bowing’; and We said to them ‘Transgress not a variant reading of lā ta‘dū is lā ta‘addū where the original tā’ of lā tata‘addū is assimilated with the dāl in other words it is similar in meaning to lā ta‘tadū ‘do not act unjustly in’ the Sabbath’ by fishing during it and We took from them a firm covenant over this but they broke it."
