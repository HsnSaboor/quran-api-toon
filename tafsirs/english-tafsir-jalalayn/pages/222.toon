tafsir[7]{c,v,t}:
  11,6,"And there is not wa-mā min min is extra a creature dābba is that creature which treads dabba in the earth but the sustenance thereof rests on God sustenance which He has undertaken to provide out of His bounty exalted be He. And He knows its habitation its dwelling-place in this world — or in the loins — and its repository after death or in the womb. All that which is mentioned is in a manifest a clear Book which is the Preserved Tablet al-lawh al-mahfūz."
  11,7,"And He it is Who created the heavens and the earth in six days the first of which was Sunday and the last Friday — and His Throne before creating them was upon the water borne by the winds — that He might try you li-yabluwakum is semantically connected to khalaqa ‘He Who created’ in other words He created them and all that is beneficial and good for you in them in order to test you which of you is best in conduct that is which of you is most obedient to God. And if you were to say O Muhammad (s) to them ‘Truly you shall be raised again after death’ those who disbelieve will say ‘This Qur’ān that speaks of resurrection — or this that you are saying — is nothing but manifest clear sorcery’ sihrun a variant reading has sāhirun ‘sorcerer’ in which case the reference is to the Prophet s."
  11,8,"And if we postpone the chastisement for them until the arrival of a reckoned time reckoned moments they will surely say in mockery ‘What is detaining it?’ what is preventing it from being sent down? God exalted be He says Verily on the day when it comes to them it cannot be averted warded off from them and that chastisement which they derided shall surround them it shall come down upon them."
  11,9,"And if We cause the disbelieving man to taste some mercy from Us such as wealth and good health and then wrest it from him lo! he is despairing having lost hope of God’s mercy ungrateful intensely ungrateful to Him."
  11,10,"But if We cause him to taste prosperity after some misery such as impoverishment and hardship that had befallen him assuredly he will say ‘The ills the afflictions have gone from me’ when he had not anticipated that they would go away; yet still he does not give thanks for this; lo! he is exultant wanton boastful to people of what he has been given;"
  11,11,"save but those who endure misery patiently and perform righteous deeds during times of comfort; theirs will be forgiveness and a great reward which is Paradise."
  11,12,"Perhaps O Muhammad (s) you might think to leave out some of what is revealed to you such that you do not convey it to them for they do not take it seriously and that your breast should be straitened by it by reciting it to them because they say ‘Why has a treasure not been sent down for him or an angel not come with him?’ to confirm his sincerity as we had requested? You are but a warner and yours is only to convey the Message not to produce what they have requested; and God is Guardian over all things He is Preserver of all things so He will requite them accordingly."
