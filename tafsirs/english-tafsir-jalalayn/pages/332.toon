  22,1,"O mankind that is the inhabitants of Mecca and others fear your Lord that is of His punishment by being obedient to Him. Surely the earthquake of the Hour of Doom that is the violent quaking of the earth after which the sun will rise from the west something which will be near the time of the Hour is a tremendous thing in the way it will distress people — this itself being a sort of punishment."
  22,2,"On the day when you behold it every actually nursing female on account of this tremendous day will neglect her suckling that is she will forget it; and every pregnant female will deliver her burden and you will see mankind as though drunk because of the severity of their fear yet they will not be drunk because of any drink; but God’s chastisement is severe and so they will be terrified of it."
  22,3,"The following was revealed regarding al-Nadr b. al-Hārith and his companions And among mankind are those who dispute about God without any knowledge — they would say ‘The angels are God’s daughters and the Qur’ān a collection of the fables of the ancients’. In addition they would deny resurrection and the bringing back to life of those who had become dust — and those who follow in their manner of disputing every rebellious devil"
  22,4,"about whom it has been decreed in other words it has been decreed with regards to a devil that whoever takes him for a friend that is whoever follows him he will make him go astray and will lead him summon him to the chastisement of the Blaze namely to the Fire."
  22,5,"O mankind in other words O people of Mecca if you are in doubt about the Resurrection then lo! consider that We have created you that is We have created your origin — Adam — from dust then We created his progeny from a drop a sperm-drop then from a clot congealed blood then from a little lump of flesh mudgha a piece of flesh the size of what one would be able to chew mā yumdagh partly formed shaped complete in form and partly unformed that is uncomplete in form that We may make clear to you the perfect nature of Our power that you might then infer from this initial act of creation the reality of its future restoration. And We establish nuqirru marks a new grammatically independent sentence in the wombs whatever We will for a specified time that is until the time for it to come out then We bring you forth from the bellies of your mothers as infants and then We extend your life that you may come of age ashuddakum that is to say your prime and strength which is that age between thirty and forty years. And there are some of you who are taken away by death before coming of age and there are some of you who are relegated to the most abject time of life its most despicable state of decrepitude and senility so that after having had some knowledge he no longer knows anything — ‘Ikrima said ‘Whoever recites the Qur’ān such a state will not befall him’. And you see the earth torpid barren yet when We send down water upon it it stirs it moves and swells it rises and grows and grows plants of anbatat min min is extra every delightful fair kind species."
