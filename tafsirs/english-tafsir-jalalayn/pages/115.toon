tafsir[4]{c,v,t}:
  5,42,"They are listeners to calumny and consumers of unlawful gain read suhut or suht that which is illicit such as bribes. If they come to you to judge between them then judge between them or turn away from them the second option given here was abrogated by His saying So judge between them to the end of the verse Q. 548. Therefore we Muslims are obliged to judge between them if they request arbitration before us — and this is the more sound of al-Shāfi‘ī’s two opinions. If their request for arbitration involves a Muslim however then we are obliged to judge according to the consensus of legal scholars and not just al-Shāfi‘ī; if you turn away from them they cannot harm you at all; and if you judge between them then judge justly between them; God loves the just those that judge fairly meaning that He will reward them."
  5,43,"But how is it that they make you their judge when they have the Torah wherein is God’s judgement of stoning the interrogative here is for provoking amazement in other words they were not seeking thereby by making you their judge to discover the truth but a lighter punishment for them; and then they turn away and then they reject your ruling of stoning which accords with what is in their Scripture after that request to you for arbitration? Such are not believers."
  5,44,"Surely We revealed the Torah wherein is guidance from error and light that is an exposition of the rulings by which the prophets from the Children of Israel who had submitted who had been compliant before God judged for those of Jewry as did the rabbis the scholars among them and the priests the jurists according to because of that which they were bidden to observe that which was entrusted to them that is to say that which God bid them to observe of God’s Scripture lest they change it and were witnesses to its truth. So do not fear men O Jews in disclosing what you have pertaining to the descriptions of Muhammad (s) the ‘stoning’ verse and otherwise; but fear Me when you conceal it; and do not sell do not exchange My signs for a small price of this world which you take in return for concealing them. Whoever does not judge according to what God has revealed — such are the disbelievers in it."
  5,45,"And therein in the Torah We prescribed We made obligatory for them that a life be slain in return for a life if it has slain one; and an eye should be gouged out for an eye and a nose is to be cut off for a nose and an ear is to be amputated for an ear and a tooth should be pulled out for a tooth a variant reading has the last four nouns in the nominative; and for wounds read wa’l-jurūhu or wa’l-jurūha retaliation that is the person is entitled to retaliate if this is feasible as in the case of a hand or a leg; but in cases where one is not able to retaliate this is left to arbitration. Although this stipulation was prescribed for them it is established in our Law; but whoever forgoes it that is retaliation out of charity able to restrain himself then that shall be an expiation for him of what he has done of other sins. Whoever does not judge according to what God has revealed in the matter of retaliation and otherwise those are the evildoers."
