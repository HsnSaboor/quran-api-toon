tafsir[8]{c,v,t}:
  10,26,"For those who do good by having faith is the fairest reward Paradise and more which is to contemplate God exalted be He as reported in a hadīth by Muslim in his Sahīh; neither dust soot nor ignominy grief shall overcome envelop their faces. Those they are the inhabitants of Paradise therein they will abide."
  10,27,"And for those wa’lladhīna is a supplement to li’lladhīna ahsanū ‘for those who do good’ so understand it as wa-li’lladhīna ‘and for those’ who earn evil deeds by practising idolatry there shall be the requital of an evil deed by the like thereof; ignominy shall overcome them — they have no protector no defender against God — as if their faces had been covered with cloaked in strips of darkest night read qita‘an as the plural of qit‘a; or qit‘an meaning juz’an ‘a part’. Those they are the inhabitants of the Fire therein they will abide."
  10,28,"And mention the day on which We shall gather them that is creation all together then We shall say to those who associated others with God ‘In your place! makānakum is in the accusative because ilzamū ‘adhere to’ is implied sc. ilzamū makānakum. You antum this emphasises the second person plural subject concealed in the implied verb ilzamū and allows for the supplement that follows and your associates!’ that is the idols. Then We shall make a separation We shall distinguish between them and the believers as is stated in the verse wa’mtāzū’l-yawma ayyuhā’l-mujrimūn ‘Now be separate you sinners upon this day!’ Q. 3659; and their associates will say to them ‘It was not us that you were worshipping mā of mā-kuntum ‘you were not …’ is for negation; the direct object iyyānā ‘us’ precedes the verb in order to accord with the end-rhyme of the Qur’ānic verse;"
  10,29,"God suffices as a witness between us and you that indeed in is softened so read as innā we were unaware of your worship’."
  10,30,"There that is on that day every soul shall experience tablū derives from balwā ‘a trial’; a variant reading has tatlū ‘it shall recite’ derived from tilāwa ‘recitation’ what it did before what it offered in the way of deeds and they shall be returned to God their rightful their established everlasting Lord and that which they were inventing of lies against Him in the way of associates shall fail them shall be absent before them."
  10,31,"Say to them ‘Who provides for you rain out of the heaven and plants out of the earth or Who owns hearing meaning the ability to make hear that is the creation of this faculty and sight and Who brings forth the living from the dead and brings forth the dead from the living and Who directs affairs?’ between creatures? They will surely say ‘It is He God.’ Then say to them ‘Will you not then fear?’ Him and believe?"
  10,32,"That Doer of all these things then is God your true established Lord so what is there after truth except error? the interrogative is meant as an affirmative in other words there is nothing after it truth other than that error; thus he who mistakes the truth which is the worship of God has fallen into error. How then are you turned away from faith despite the proofs having been established?"
  10,33,"Thus just as those are turned away from faith so the Word of your Lord is justified concerning those who are wicked those who disbelieve and this Word is either the verse Q. 3213‘Verily I shall fill Hell with jinn and mankind together’ or it is the following that they do not believe."
