Yet among people that is people such as the Meccan disbelievers there are those who dispute concerning God without any knowledge or guidance from a messenger or an illuminating scripture revealed by God rather they dispute by blindly imitating others."
  31,21,"And if it is said to them ‘Follow what God has revealed’ they say ‘We will rather follow what we found our fathers following’. He exalted be He says What! Would they follow such things even though Satan were calling them to the chastisement of the Blaze? that is to what will bring it about necessarily? No!"
  31,22,"And whoever surrenders his purpose to God that is whoever takes to obeying Him and is virtuous a believer in His Oneness has certainly grasped the firmest handle the stronger end which is not in danger of being severed and to God belongs the sequel of all matters their ultimate return."
  31,23,"And whoever disbelieves then do not let his disbelief grieve you O Muhammad (s) do not be concerned with his disbelief. To Us shall be their return and We shall inform them of what they did. Truly God knows best what is in the breasts just as He knows other things and so He will requite them accordingly."
  31,24,"We will give them comfort in this world for a little while for the duration of the days of their lives then We will drive them in the Hereafter to a harsh chastisement namely the chastisement of the Fire from which they will find no escape."
  31,25,"And if wa-la-in the lām is for oaths you were to ask them ‘Who created the heavens and the earth?’ they will surely say ‘God’ la-yaqūlunna ‘they will surely say’ the indicative nūn has been omitted because of the like sc. the nūn coming after it and likewise the wāw of the plural person because of two unvocalised consonants coming together. Say ‘Praise be to God’ for the manifestation of the definitive argument against them by the affirmation of the Oneness of God. Nay but most of them do not realise that this affirmation is an obligation upon them."

  31,27,"And if all the trees on earth were pens and the sea wa’l-bahru is a supplement to mā the subject of anna replenished with seven more seas were ink the Words of God would not be spent those words expressing all the things He knows written in those pens with that amount of ink or with even more ink than that would not be spent for His knowledge exalted be He is infinite. Truly God is Mighty nothing being beyond Him Wise from Whose knowledge and wisdom nothing escapes."
  31,28,"Your creation and your resurrection are only as that of a single soul in terms of creation and resurrection because it is the result of the words kun fa-yakūn ‘“Be!” and it is!’ Truly God is Hearer hearing everything that may be heard Seer seeing everything that may be seen nothing able to distract Him from anything else."
