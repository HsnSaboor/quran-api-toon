  14,6,"And mention when Moses said to his people ‘Remember God’s grace to you when He delivered you from the folk of Pharaoh who were inflicting upon you a dreadful chastisement and were slaughtering your sons the new-born and sparing keeping alive your women — this was because some of the priests of Egypt had stated that a child born among the Israelites shall be the cause of the destruction of Pharaoh’s kingdom; and in that deliverance — or in that chastisement — was a tremendous trial grace — or a tremendous test — from your Lord."
  14,7,"And when your Lord proclaimed when He made it known that “If you are thankful for My graces through affirmation of My Oneness and obedience to Me then assuredly I shall give you more; but if you are thankless if you deny the truth of the grace through disbelief and disobedience then assuredly I shall chastise you — as is indicated by His following words — My chastisement is indeed severe” ’."

He calls you to obedience of Him so that He might forgive you your sins min dhunūbikum min is extra since through submission to the One God all that may have been committed previously is forgiven or else it min ‘some of’ is partitive intended to state that forgiveness which is due to God’s servants and defer you without chastisement to an appointed term’ the term of death. They said ‘You are but mortals like us desiring to bar us from that which our fathers used to worship in the way of idols. So bring us a clear warrant’ a manifest argument demonstrating your truthfulness."
