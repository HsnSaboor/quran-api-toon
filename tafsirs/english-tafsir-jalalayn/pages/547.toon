tafsir[7]{c,v,t}:
  59,10,"And those who will come after them after the Emigrants and the Helpers up to the Day of Resurrection say ‘Our Lord forgive us and our brethren who preceded us in embracing the faith and do not place any rancour any spite in our hearts toward those who believe. Our Lord You are indeed Kind Merciful!’."
  59,11,"Have you not considered have you not seen the hypocrites who say to their brethren who disbelieve from among the People of the Scripture namely the Banū al-Nadīr their brethren in disbelief ‘If la-in the lām is for oaths in all four instances you are expelled from Medina we will assuredly go forth with you and we will never obey anyone against you to forsake you. And if you are fought against wa-in qūtiltum the prefatory lām of la-in has been omitted we will certainly help you’. And God bears witness that they are truly liars."
  59,12,"For indeed if they are expelled they would not go forth with them and if they are fought against they would not help them. And even if they were to help them that is to say even if they came to help them they would surely turn their backs to flee the implied response to the oath suffices in place of the response to the conditional in all five instances — then they the Jews would not be helped."
  59,13,"You indeed arouse greater awe fear in their hearts that is the hearts of the hypocrites than God — but only because He has deferred His chastisement to the Hereafter. That is because they are a people who do not comprehend."
  59,14,"They that is the Jews will not fight against you together all in a single body except in fortified towns or from behind some wall jidār a variant reading has plural judur ‘walls’ some kind of protective fence. Their might their belligerence is great among themselves. You would suppose them to be all together united as a single body but their hearts are disunited scattered contrary to supposition. That is because they are a people who have no sense;"
  59,15,"their likeness in relinquishing faith is as the likeness of those who recently before them a short time before — these being the idolaters from among those who fought at Badr — tasted the evil consequences of their conduct the punishment for it in this world by being killed or otherwise. And for them there will be a painful chastisement in the Hereafter."
  59,16,"In addition their likeness in heeding the words of the hypocrites and their forsaking of them is like Satan when he says to man ‘Disbelieve!’; so that when he man disbelieves he says ‘Lo! I am absolved of you. Indeed I fear God the Lord of the Worlds’ out of mendacity and dissimulation on his part."
