tafsir[9]{c,v,t}:
  6,102,"That then is God your Lord. There is no god but Him the Creator of all things. So worship Him affirm His Oneness. And He is Guardian over He is Keeper of all things."
  6,103,"Vision cannot attain Him that is they the eyes cannot see Him — this is a denial that applies in particular circumstances since it is accepted that the believer will see Him in the Hereafter as indicated by God’s words On that Day faces shall be radiant gazing upon their Lord Q. 7522f. and by the hadīth of the two Shaykhs Bukhārī and Muslim ‘Verily you shall see your Lord as clearly as you see the full moon at night’ — and it is also said to mean that it vision cannot encompass Him; but He attains all vision that is to say He perceives them whereas they cannot perceive Him; it is not possible in the case of anyone other than Him to attain all vision while it vision cannot attain Him or encompass Him in knowledge. And He is the Subtle in dealing with His friends the Aware of them."
  6,104,"Say O Muhammad (s) to them Clear proofs have come to you from your Lord; whoever perceives them and believes then it is for his own good that he has perceived them since the reward resulting from his perception will be his; and whoever is blind to them and goes astray then it the evil consequence of his being astray will be to his own hurt. And I am not a keeper a watcher over you of your deeds I am but a warner."
  6,105,"And so in the same way that We have explained what has been mentioned We dispense We elucidate the signs that they might take heed and that they the disbelievers may say at the end of this ‘You have studied with someone’ that you have consulted with dārasta the People of the Scripture or that you have studied darasta variant reading the scriptures of past peoples and brought this Qur’ān therefrom; and that We may make it clear for a people who have knowledge."
  6,106,"Follow what has been revealed to you from your Lord namely the Qur’ān. There is no god but Him; and turn away from the idolaters."
  6,107,"Had God willed they would not have been idolaters; and We have not set you as a keeper over them a watcher so that you might then requite them for their deeds; nor are you a guardian over them so that you might be able to coerce them to faith — this was revealed before the command to fight them."
  6,108,"Do not revile those whom they call upon besides God namely the idols lest they then revile God out of spite out of aggression and wrongfully through ignorance that is through their ignorance of God. So in the same way that We have adorned for these that which they practise We have adorned for every community their good and evil deeds and they commit them; then to their Lord they shall return in the Hereafter and He will tell them what they used to do and requite them for it."
  6,109,"They that is the disbelievers of Mecca have sworn by God the most earnest oaths that if there came to them a sign of what they requested they will believe in it. Say to them ‘Signs are only with God’ and He sends them down as and when He wills; I am but a warner. But what will make you realise? how would you know if they have believed if these signs did come to them? In other words you would not know this; truly when they come they will not believe because of what I already know a variant reading for lā yu’minūna ‘they will not believe’ has lā tu’minūna ‘you will not believe’ making the address to the disbelievers; another variant reading has annahā instead of innahā ‘that truly’ as meaning la‘alla ‘that perhaps’ or as governed by the preceding clause la’in jā’athum āyatun ‘if there came to them a sign’."
  6,110,"And We shall confound their hearts We shall turn their hearts away from the truth so that they cannot understand it and their eyes away from it so that they do not see it and thus do not believe; just as they did not believe in it that is in the verses that have been revealed the first time; and We shall leave them in their insolence in their misguidance wandering blindly hesitating perplexed."
