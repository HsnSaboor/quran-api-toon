tafsir[9]{c,v,t}:
  3,53,"Lord we believe in what You have revealed of the Gospel and we follow the Messenger Jesus; inscribe us therefore with those who bear witness’ to Your Oneness and to the truthfulness of Your Messenger."
  3,54,"God says And they the disbelievers among the Children of Israel schemed against Jesus by assigning someone to assassinate him; and God schemed by casting the likeness of Jesus onto the person who intended to kill him and so they killed him while Jesus was raised up into heaven; and God is the best of schemers most knowledgeable of him Jesus."
  3,55,"And mention when God said ‘O Jesus I am gathering you seizing you and raising you to Me away from the world without death and I am cleansing you of removing you far away from those who disbelieved and I am setting those who follow you those Christians and Muslims who believed in your prophethood above those who disbelieved in you namely the Jews becoming above them through definitive argument and the sword until the Day of Resurrection. Then to Me shall be your return and I will decide between you as to what you were at variance about as regards religion."
  3,56,"As for the disbelievers I will chastise them with a terrible chastisement in this world through being killed taken captive and made to pay the jizya and the Hereafter in the Fire; they shall have no helpers none to protect them from it."
  3,57,"But as for the believers who do righteous deeds He will pay them in full yuwaffīhim is also read nuwaffīhim ‘We will pay them in full’ their wages. God loves not the evildoers that is He will chastise them. It is reported that God exalted be He sent him Jesus a cloud which raised him up but his mother clutched to him in tears. He then said to her ‘Verily the Resurrection shall bring us together again’. This took place on the Night of Ordainment laylat al-qadr in the Holy House of Jerusalem when he was thirty three years old. His mother lived on after him for six years. The two Shaykhs Bukhārī and Muslim narrate a hadīth in which it is stated that he Jesus will descend when the Hour is nigh and will rule according to the Law of our Prophet Muhammad and that he will slay the false messiah and the swine break the cross and impose the jizya. In a hadīth recorded by Muslim he will remain for seven years; according to Abū Dāwūd al-Tayālisī he will remain for forty years and he will die and have prayers performed over him. It is possible that what is meant by the forty years is the total time he will have spent on earth before he was raised and afterwards."
  3,58,"This what is mentioned of the matter of Jesus We recite to you narrate to you O Muhammad (s) of verses and wise clear remembrance namely the Qur’ān min al-āyāt ‘of verses’ is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the suffixed pronoun hā’ of natlūhu and its operator is the demonstrative import of dhālika ‘this’."
  3,59,"Truly the likeness of Jesus his remarkable case in God’s sight is as Adam’s likeness as the case of Adam whom God created without father or mother this is a comparison of one remarkable thing with another more remarkable so that it convinces the disputer and establishes itself in one’s mind more effectively. He created him Adam that is his form of dust then said He to him ‘Be’ a human being and he was; similarly He said to Jesus ‘Be’ — without a father — and he was."
  3,60,"The truth is from your Lord al-haqqu min rabbik the predicate of a missing subject which is implied to be amr ‘Īsā ‘the matter concerning Jesus’; be not of those who waver those who are uncertain about it."
  3,61,"And whoever from among the Christians disputes with you concerning him after the knowledge of his affair that has come to you say to them ‘Come! Let us call our sons and your sons our wives and your wives our selves and your selves and gather them together then let us humbly pray and invoke God’s curse upon those who lie’ by saying ‘Lord curse the one that tells lies concerning the affair of Jesus’. The Prophet s had called upon the Najrān delegation to do this when they disputed with him about Jesus. They said ‘Let us think about it and we will come back to you’. The judicious one among them said ‘You know that he is a prophet and that every people that has ever challenged a prophet to a mutual imprecation has been destroyed’. They left him and departed. When they went to see the Prophet s who had set out with al-Hasan al-Husayn Fātima and ‘Alī he said to them the Najrān delegation ‘When I supplicate you say ‘Amen’; but they refrained from this mutual imprecation and made peace with the Prophet on the condition that they pay the jizya as reported by Abū Nu‘aym. According to Ibn ‘Abbās the Prophet said ‘Had they set out and performed the mutual cursing they would have gone home and found neither possessions nor family’. It is also reported that had they set out with this intention they would have been consumed by fire."
