tafsir[9]{c,v,t}:
  6,36,"Only those who hear in such a way so as to understand and take heed will answer your call to faith; as for the dead that is the disbelievers — they are likened to them on account of their inability to hear — God will resurrect them in the Hereafter and then to Him they will be returned and He will requite them for their deeds."
  6,37,"And they the disbelievers of Mecca say ‘Why has a sign not been sent down to him from his Lord?’ a sign such as the she-camel of the prophet Sālih or the staff of Moses or the Table of Jesus. Say to them ‘Surely God has the power to send down read yunazzil or yunzil a sign from among those they have requested but most of them do not know’ that its sending down would be a trial for them for if they then still denied it they would necessarily be destroyed."
  6,38,"There is no mā min min is extra animal that crawls on the earth and no bird that flies through the air with its wings but they are communities like to you in the way that its creation has been ordained together with its sustenance and affairs. We have neglected nothing min shay’ min is extra in the Book in the Preserved Tablet al-lawh al-mahfūz nothing that We have not written; then to their Lord they shall be gathered and judgement shall be passed upon them and the hornless sheep shall retaliate against the horned ram and then it will be said to them the animals ‘Be dust’."
  6,39,"And those who deny Our signs the Qur’ān are deaf to hearing them in such a way so as to accept them and dumb unable to utter truth in darkness in unbelief. He whom God wills to send astray He sends astray and whom He wills to guide He sets him on a straight path a straight road the religion of Islam."
  6,40,"Say O Muhammad (s) to the Meccans ‘Do you see yourselves that is inform me if God’s chastisement comes upon you in this world or the Hour the Resurrection which includes this chastisement comes upon you suddenly will ye call upon any other than God? No! If you speak truly!’ that the idols can benefit you then call upon them."
  6,41,"Nay; upon Him and upon none other you will call in times of tribulation and He will remove that which you call upon Him to remove from you such things as suffering if He wills to remove it and you will forget you will neglect what you associate with Him of idols and will not call them."
  6,42,"Indeed We sent to communities before you min qablika min is extra messengers but they denied them and We seized them with misery abject poverty and hardship illness so that they might be humble abased that they might believe."
  6,43,"If only when Our might Our punishment came upon them they had been humble in other words they were not so even though the necessitating factor was there. But their hearts were hard and would not yield to faith and Satan adorned for them what they were doing in the way of disobedient acts and so they persisted in them."
  6,44,"So when they forgot when they neglected that whereof they were reminded that with which they were admonished and threatened in the way of misery and hardship; and they did not heed the admonition We opened read fatahnā or fattahnā to them the gates of all things in the way of graces in order to draw them on by degrees until when they rejoiced in what they were given a wanton rejoicing We seized them suddenly with chastisement and lo! they were confounded despairing of anything good."
