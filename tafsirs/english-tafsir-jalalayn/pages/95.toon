tafsir[4]{c,v,t}:
  4,102,"When you O Muhammad (s) are present among them while you all fear an enemy and you stand to lead them in prayer this type of address is customary in the Qur’ān let a party of them stand with you while another party stand back and let them the party standing with you take their weapons with them. Then when they have performed their prostrations that is when they have prayed let them the other party be behind you on guard until you complete the prayers; thereupon let this party go on guard and let another party who have not prayed come and pray with you taking their precautions and their weapons with them until you have completed the prayers. The Prophet s did this once at Batn Nakhla as reported by the two Shaykhs Bukhārī and Muslim. The disbelievers wish when you have stood up to pray that you should be heedless of your weapons and your baggage that they may descend upon you all at once by making an assault against you and capturing you and herein is the reasoning behind keeping weapons on oneself. You are not at fault if rain bothers you or if you are sick to lay aside your weapons and not carry them this implies that when there is no such excuse it is compulsory to carry them and this is one of two opinions held by al-Shāfi‘ī on this matter; the other opinion is that this precaution constitutes a sunna and this is the more preferable opinion. But take your precautions against the enemy and be on your guard as best you can; God has prepared for the disbelievers a humiliating chastisement."
  4,103,"When you have performed the prayer when you have completed it remember God by repeating ‘There is no god but God’ tahlīl and ‘Glory be to God’ tasbīh standing and sitting and on your sides lying down in other words in all states. Then when you are reassured when you are secure observe the prayer perform it with its proper due surely the prayer is for believers a prescription enjoined that is an obligation at specific times that is its appointed times are set and so it should not be postponed from these times."
  4,104,"After they returned from Uhud the Prophet s dispatched a group to seek out Abū Sufyān and his companions but they complained about their wounds and the following was revealed Be not faint be not weak in seeking in pursuing the enemy the disbelievers in order to fight them; if you are suffering if you have pains from a wound they are also suffering as you are suffering that is just like you yet they do not shrink from fighting you; and you hope from God in the way of victory and the reward for it that for which they cannot hope and since you have this advantage over them you should be more willing for it than them. God is ever Knower of all things Wise in His actions."
  4,105,"Tu‘ma b. Ubayriq stole a coat of mail and hid it with a Jew. When it was discovered with the latter Tu‘ma accused him of having stolen it and swore by God that he Tu‘ma had not stolen it and his clan asked the Prophet s to advocate on his behalf and absolve him whereupon the following was revealed Surely We have revealed to you the Book the Qur’ān with the truth bi’l-haqq is semantically connected to anzalnā ‘We have revealed’ so that you may judge between people by that which God has shown you what God has taught you. And do not be a disputant for traitors like Tu‘ma disputing on their behalf."
