tafsir[5]{c,v,t}:
  58,7,"Have you not seen have you not realised that God knows all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth? Not secret conversation of three takes place but He is their fourth companion by virtue of His omniscience nor of five but He is their sixth nor of fewer than that or more but He is with them wherever they may be. Then He will inform them of what they did on the Day of Resurrection. Assuredly God has knowledge of all things."
  58,8,"Have you not seen have you not observed those who were forbidden from conversing in secret but then returned to that they had been forbidden and all the while hold secret conversations tainted with sin and plans for enmity and disobedience to the Messenger? These were the Jews whom the Prophet s had forbidden them what they used to do in their secret talks that is their habit of conversing secretly with one another and giving the believers looks in order to cast doubt into their hearts about the faith. And who when they come to you they greet you O Prophet with that with which God never greeted you — namely their saying to the Prophet al-sāmu ‘alayka meaning ‘Death be upon you’ and they say within themselves ‘Why does God not chastise us for what we say?’ in the way of such a greeting and our saying that he is not a prophet if he truly were a prophet. Hell will suffice them! In it they will be made to burn — and what an evil journey’s end! it is."
  58,9,"O you who believe if you do talk in secret then do not talk in secret sinfully and in enmity and disobedience to the Messenger but talk secretly in piety and fear of God. And fear God to Whom you will be gathered."
  58,10,"Secret conversations tainted with sin and the like are of the work of Satan a result of his deception that those who believe may end up grieving; but he cannot harm them in any way except God’s leave that is except by His will. And in God let the believers put all their trust."
  58,11,"O you who believe when it is said to you ‘Make room’ during the assembly during the assembly convened with the Prophet s or for remembrance so that those arriving to join you may find room to sit al-majlis ‘assembly’ may also be read in the plural al-majālis then make room; God will make room for you in Paradise. And when it is said ‘Rise up’ stand up for prayer or for other good deeds do rise up a variant reading for unshuzū fa’nshuzū has anshizū in both instances sc. anshizū fa’nshizū; God will raise those of you who have faith thereby obeying this command and He will raise those who have been given knowledge by degrees in Paradise. And God is Aware of what you do."
