  12,15,"So when they went off with him and agreed resolved to put him into the bottom of the well the response of lammā ‘when’ has been omitted in other words understand it as being fa‘alū dhālika ‘they did just that’ by taking off his shirt — after having beaten him humiliated him and desiring to kill him — and lowering him in a bucket into the well. When he reached half-way down the well they flung him from the bucket so that he would fall and die but he fell into the water and took refuge near a rock. They then called to him and he responded thinking that they had decided to have mercy on him. They then wanted to smash his head with a rock but Judah prevented them. And We revealed to him in the well through true revelation wahy haqīqa — he was 17 years of age or just under — in order to reassure his heart ‘Truly you shall inform them after this day of this affair this deed of theirs when they are unaware’ of who you are wa-hum lā yash‘urūna is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the action of ‘informing’."
  12,16,"And they came to their father in the evening weeping."
  12,17,"They said ‘O father we went competing shooting and left Joseph by our things our clothes and the wolf ate him. But you would never believe us even though we speak the truth’ before you you would still have accused us of lying in this story because of your adoration of Joseph so how much more so when you think ill of us?"
  12,18,"And they came with false blood on his shirt ‘alā qamīsihi has the status of an accusative of the verb because it is an adverbial qualifier meaning fawqa qamīsihi they slaughtered a lamb and dabbed it his shirt with its blood — but they forgot to tear it the shirt — and they said that it was his blood. He Jacob said when he saw that it the shirt was undamaged and realised that they were lying ‘Nay but your souls have beguiled you into something and so you did it to him. Yet comely patience! without any anxiety! fa-sabrun jamīlun is the predicate of a missing subject such as amrī ‘my course’. And God is the One Whose succour is sought in that predicament which you describe’ that which you mention of Joseph’s affair."
  12,19,"And there came a caravan — travellers going from Midian to Egypt who stopped near to Joseph’s well — and they sent their water-drawer the one who goes down to the water source to draw from it and he let down his bucket into the well and Joseph clung to it and he pulled him out and when he saw him he said ‘Good news!’ a variant reading of yā bushrā has yā bushrāya this vocative call is figurative in other words it is to be understood as ‘Come O good news now is your time!’ ‘This is a young boy’. His brothers became aware of this and came to him and they hid him that is they disguised his real status claiming that he was as a piece of merchandise by saying ‘This is a slave of ours he is a runaway’; but Joseph did not say anything fearing that they might kill him. But God knew well what they were doing."
  12,20,"Then they sold him — they the caravan purchased him from them — for a very low a diminished price a handful of dirhams 20 or 22; for they that is his brothers set small store by him. So the caravan brought him to Egypt where the one who had bought him sold him for 20 dinars two pairs of sandals and two robes."
  12,21,"And he of Egypt who purchased him Potifar the Court Officer Qitfīr al-‘azīz said to his wife Zulaikha Zulaykhā ‘Give him an honourable place an honourable residence with us. Maybe he will be useful to us or we may adopt him as a son’ — for he was chaste. Thus just as We delivered him from being killed and from the well and softened the Court Officer’s heart for him We established Joseph in the land the land of Egypt until he attained what status he attained that We might teach him the interpretation of events the interpretation of visions wa-li-nu‘allimahu min ta’wīli’l-ahādīth is a supplement to an implied missing part connected to makkannā ‘We established’ in other words an implied li-numallikahu ‘so that We might give him kingship’; or else the wāw of wa-li-nu‘allimahu ‘that We might teach him’ is to be understood as being extra. God’s way always prevails exalted be He nothing being beyond Him but most people — and they are the disbelievers — do not know this."
  12,22,"And when he reached his prime — which was at 30 or 33 years of age — We gave him power of judgement wisdom and knowledge understanding in matters of religion before his call to prophethood. Thus just as We rewarded him We reward those who are virtuous to the good of their souls."
