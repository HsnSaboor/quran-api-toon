tafsir[8]{c,v,t}:
  6,45,"So the last remnant of the people who did evil was cut off by having them annihilated. Praise be to God Lord of the Worlds for giving victory to the messengers and destroying the disbelievers."
  6,46,"Say to the people of Mecca ‘Have you considered inform me if God were to seize your hearing if He were to make you deaf and your sight if He were to make you blind and set stamp a seal upon your hearts so that you no longer knew anything who is the god other than God to give it back to you?’ that which He took away from you as you are wont to claim? See how We dispense how We make clear the signs the proofs of Our Oneness! Yet thereafter they are turning away they reject them and do not believe."
  6,47,"Say to them ‘Have you considered for yourselves if God’s chastisement were to come upon you suddenly or openly? at night or during the day; Would any be destroyed except the evildoing the unbelieving folk?’ That is to say none but these will be destroyed."
  6,48,"We do not send messengers except as bearers of good tidings to those who believe good tidings of Paradise and as warners to those who disbelieve warning of the Fire. Whoever believes in them and makes amends in his deeds no fear shall befall them neither shall they grieve in the Hereafter."
  6,49,"But those who deny Our signs the chastisement shall afflict them because they were wicked rebelling against obedience."
  6,50,"Say to them ‘I do not say to you “I possess the treasure houses of God” from which He provides sustenance; and I do not have knowledge of the Unseen that which is hidden from me and has not been revealed to me. And I do not say to you “I am an angel” from among the angels; I only follow what is revealed to me.’ Say ‘Is the blind man the disbeliever equal to the seeing man the believer? No! Will you not then reflect’ upon this and believe?"
  6,51,"And warn threaten therewith that is with the Qur’ān those who fear they shall be gathered to their Lord apart from Him other than Him they have no protector to help them and no intercessor to intercede for them the negative sentence stands as a circumstantial qualifier referring to the subject of the verb yuhsharū ‘they shall be gathered’ and constitutes the object of what they fear — the sinning believers are meant here; so that they might be wary of God by desisting from what they engage in and performing deeds of obedience."
  6,52,"And do not drive away those who call upon their Lord at morning and evening desiring through their worship His countenance exalted be He and not desiring any of the transient things of this world — and these are the poor. The idolaters had reviled them and demanded that he the Prophet expel them so that they could sit with him. The Prophet s wanted to do this because of his desire that they become Muslims. You are not accountable for them in anything min shay’in min is extra if what they hide in themselves be displeasing; nor are they accountable for you in anything that you should drive them away this is the response to the negative sentence and be of the evildoers if you do this."
