tafsir[5]{c,v,t}:
  4,15,"As for those of your women who commit lewdness adultery call four Muslim men of you to witness against them; and if they witness against them such lewdness then detain them in their houses and prevent them from mixing with people until the angels of death take them or until God appoints for them a way out of it. This was stipulated for them at the very beginning of Islam but then a way out was appointed for them through the stipulation that the virgin should receive a hundred lashes and be banished for a year and the married woman be stoned. The prescribed punishment was explained thus in the hadīth ‘Come listen to me! Come listen to me! God has now made a way out for them’ as reported by Muslim."
  4,16,"And when two of you read wa’lladhāni or wa’lladhānni men commit it that is a lewd act adultery or homosexual intercourse punish them both with insults and beatings with sandals; but if they repent of this lewd act and make amends through good action then leave them be and do not harm them. God ever turns relenting to those who repent and is Merciful to them. This verse is abrogated by the prescribed punishment if adultery is meant by the lewd act and similarly if homosexual intercourse is meant according to al-Shāfi‘ī; but according to him the person who is the object of the penetrative act is not stoned even if he be married; rather he is flogged and banished. Judging by the dual person pronoun it seems more obvious that homosexual fornication is meant by this verse even though the former sc. al-Shāfi‘ī was of the opinion that it referred to an adulterer and an adulteress; but this opinion of his may be countered by the fact that the reference to the two men becomes clear on account of the particle min being attached to a masculine pronoun minkum ‘of you’ and by the fact that they suffer the same punishment both effect the action of repentance and are both granted that they be left alone thereafter all of which applies specifically to men given that for women detention is stipulated as was stated before."
  4,17,"The repentance that God accepts that is the one which He has prescribed for Himself to accept out of His bounty is only of those who do evil an act of disobedience in ignorance bi-jahālatin a circumstantial qualifier in other words ‘they are ignorant’ while they are disobeying their Lord; then repent shortly thereafter before the last gasps of death; God will relent to those He will accept their repentance. And God is ever Knowing of His creatures Wise in what He does with them."
  4,18,"Repentance is not for those who do evil deeds sins until when death approaches one of them and the pangs of death begin he says upon witnessing his predicament ‘Indeed now I repent’ for this would not avail him and would not be accepted from him; neither for those who die disbelieving if they repent in the Hereafter upon seeing the chastisement it will not be accepted from them. Those — We have prepared for them a painful chastisement."
  4,19,"O you who believe it is not lawful for you to inherit women against their will read either karhan or kurhan as alternative forms that is to say coercing them into this. In pre-Islamic times they used to inherit women from their kin and if they so wished they could marry a woman without a dowry or marry her off and take the dowry for themselves or prevent her from marriage until she gave up what she had inherited or until she died and they could inherit from her. They were thus forbidden such practices; neither debar them your former wives from marrying others by retaining them while you have no desire for them yourselves only to harm them; so that you may go off with part of what you have given them of the dowry except when they commit flagrant read mubayyina ‘making it clear’ or mubayyana ‘clear’ lewdness such as adultery or rebellion then you have the right to coerce them until they redeem themselves to you or forfeit their dowries. Consort with them in kindness that is being decent in speaking to them with regard to their expenditure and lodging; for if you hate them then be patient; it may happen that you hate a thing wherein God has set much good that is to say perhaps He does this when He provides you with a righteous child through them."
