tafsir[7]{c,v,t}:
  29,39,"And We destroyed Korah and Pharaoh and Hāmān! And verily Moses brought them beforehand clear signs manifest proofs but they acted arrogantly in the land; and they could not thwart Us they could not elude Our chastisement."
  29,40,"So each of those mentioned We seized for his sin; and among them were some upon whom We unleashed a squall of stones as in the case of the people of Lot and among them were some who were seized by the Cry such as Thamūd and among them were some whom We made the earth swallow such as Korah and among them were some whom We drowned like the people of Noah Pharaoh and his people. And God never wronged them by chastising them for having committed no sin but they wronged themselves by committing sins."
  29,41,"The likeness of those who choose besides God other patrons namely idols from whom they hope to profit is as the likeness of the spider that makes a home for itself in which to shelter. And truly the frailest the weakest of homes is the home of the spider for it neither protects it from heat nor cold — likewise idols cannot benefit those who worship them — if they only knew this they would not worship them."
  29,42,"Truly God knows whatever thing mā functions like alladhī they call on what they worship read yad‘ūna ‘they call on’ or tad‘ūna ‘you call on’ besides Him other than Him. And He is the Mighty in His kingdom the Wise in what He does."
  29,43,"And such similitudes in the Qur’ān We strike them We coin them for the sake of mankind; but none understands them none grasp them except those who know those who reflect."
  29,44,"God created the heavens and the earth with truth that is rightly. Surely in that there is a sign indicating His power exalted be He for believers — they are specifically mentioned because they are the ones to benefit thereby in their faith in contrast to disbelievers."
  29,45,"Recite what has been revealed to you of the Book the Qur’ān and maintain prayer; truly prayer prohibits lewd acts and indecency defined as such according to the Law. In other words that is its purpose provided that the person adheres to observance of it. And the remembrance of God is surely greater than other acts of obedience and God knows what you do and He will requite you for them."
