tafsir[8]{c,v,t}:
  41,39,"And among His signs is that you see the earth desolate dried out without any vegetation but when We send down water upon it it stirs it moves and swells swells and rises. Truly He Who revives it is indeed the Reviver of the dead. Surely He has power over all things."
  41,40,"Indeed those who blaspheme yulhidūna derives from the verb alhada or lahada ‘he blasphemed’ Our signs — the Qur’ān by denying its truth — are not hidden from Us and We will requite them. Is one who is cast into the Fire better off or one who arrives secure on the Day of Resurrection? Act as you wish; indeed He is Seer of what you do — this is meant as a threat for them."
  41,41,"Truly those who disbelieve in the Remembrance — the Qur’ān — when it comes to them … We will requite them — and truly it is an unassailable Book"
  41,42,"falsehood cannot approach it from before it or from behind it in other words there is no scripture before it or after it that contradicts it; it is a revelation from One Wise Praised that is to say from God the One Who is praised in His affair."
  41,43,"Nothing is said to you in terms of denial of you except the like of what has already been said to the messengers before you. Surely your Lord is One of forgiveness to believers and also One of painful punishment for disbelievers."
  41,44,"And had We made it namely the Remembrance a non-Arabic Qur’ān they would have said ‘Why have its signs not been explained clearly? so that we might understand them? What! a Qur’ān that is non-Arabic and an Arab prophet?’ this is an interrogative of denial spoken by them; read a-a‘jamiyyun pronouncing both the first and the second hamza or by changing it into an alif and either writing it out in full or not. Say ‘For those who believe it is guidance from error and a healing from the disease of ignorance; but as for those who do not believe there is a deafness in their ears a heaviness and so they are unable to hear it and they are blind to it so they are unable to comprehend it. Those they are as if they were being called from a distant place’ that is to say they are like one who is called from far away unable to hear or comprehend what is being called out to him."
  41,45,"And verily We gave Moses the Scripture the Torah but differences arose concerning it in terms of some affirming the truth of it and others denying it as with the Qur’ān; and were it not for a Word that had already preceded from your Lord to defer the reckoning and requital of creatures until the Day of Resurrection judgement would have been made between them in this world concerning that over which they differed; for indeed they the deniers of it are in grave doubt concerning it doubt which leads to utter uncertainty."
  41,46,"Whoever acts righteously it is for the good of his own soul that he acts thus and whoever does evil it is to the detriment thereof in other words the harm consequent from his evildoing will only be to him. And your Lord is not at all a tyrant to His servants that is He is not One of injustice as He exalted be He says Surely God shall not wrong so much as the weight of an atom Q. 440."
