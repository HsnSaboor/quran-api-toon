tafsir[7]{c,v,t}:
  34,8,"Has he invented read a’ftarā; the hamza read with a fatha vowelling is for the interrogative and suffices in place of the conjunctive hamza a lie against God in this respect or is there a madness in him does he suffer a dementia on account of which he has imagined that? God exalted be He says Nay but those who do not believe in the Hereafter that comprises resurrection and chastisement will be in the chastisement thereat and in error that is far from the truth in this world."
  34,9,"Have they not observed what is before them and what is behind them in other words what is above them and what is beneath them of heaven and earth? If We will it We can make the earth swallow them or let fall on them fragments read kisfan or kisafan ‘large pieces’ from the heaven a variant reading has the third person singular for all three verbs sc. yashā’ ‘He will’ yakhsif ‘He makes to swallow’ yusqit ‘He lets fall’. Surely in that which is observed there is a sign for every penitent servant turning back to his Lord signs indicating God’s power to resurrect and to do what He will."
  34,10,"And verily We bestowed on David a great favour from Us — prophethood and scripture — and We said ‘O mountains repeat with him in praise by making glorifications and the birds too!’ read wa’l-tayra in the accusative as a supplement to the syntactical locus of jibāl ‘mountains’ in other words and We also called on them to glorify God with him. And We made iron malleable for him so that it was as dough in his hands."
  34,11,"And We said ‘Fashion from it long coats of mail — complete suits of armour which the person wearing it drags behind him along the ground — and measure well the links’ that is in the weaving of the coats the maker of these is called sarrād. In other words make them so that the rings thereof are arranged properly. And act O family of David together with him righteously. Indeed I am Seer of what you do and will requite you for it accordingly."
  34,12,"And We disposed for Solomon the wind the nominative reading of al-rīhu would be based on an implicit missing verb sakhkharnā ‘We disposed’ its morning course meaning its journey from the morning to the noon was a month’s journey and its evening course that is its journey from the noon to sunset was a month’s journey. And We caused a fount of molten copper to flow for him in other words We caused the copper to melt for him and so the fount flowed for three days and nights like water and to this day people have been using of that copper which was given to Solomon at that time. And of the jinn there were those who worked before him by the leave by the command of his Lord. And such of them as deviated from Our command to him to obey him Solomon We would make them taste the chastisement of the Blaze the Fire in the Hereafter — but it is also said that their chastisement was in this world in which case an angel would smite one of them with a lash thereof that would scorch him."
  34,13,"They fashioned for him whatever he wished lofty shrines mahārīb are high edifices which are ascended by stairs and statues tamāthīl is the plural of timthāl which is any thing which you fashion as a likeness of another in other words brass crystal or marble figures — the use of figures was not prohibited according to his Law; and basins jifān is the plural of jafna like cisterns jawābin is the plural of jābiya which is a large basin — around each ‘basin’ a thousand men would gather to eat — and cauldrons built into the ground fixed with foundations and cannot be moved from their places these were made from the rocks of the mountains of Yemen and to which one ascended by climbing up a ladder. And We said ‘Work O House of David in obedience to God in thankfulness to Him for what He has given you. And few indeed of My servants are thankful’ labouring in obedience to Me in thanks for My favours."
  34,14,"And when We decreed for him for Solomon death in other words when he died — he remained supported against his staff an entire year while the jinn continued to toil in hard labour as was customary unaware of his death until finally when a termite ate through his staff he fell to the ground and was seen to be dead — nothing indicated to them that he had died except a termite al-ard is the verbal noun from uridat al-khashaba passive verbal form in other words ‘it the piece of wood was eaten away by a termite al-arada’ that gnawed away at his staff read minsa’atahu or minsātahu replacing the hamza with an alif meaning a ‘staff’ so called because when describing it one would say yunsa’u bihā to mean it is used to repel or drive away creatures’. And when he fell down dead the jinn realised it became apparent to them that an is softened in other words annahum had they known the Unseen — comprising what was hidden from them in the way of Solomon being dead — they would not have continued in the humiliating chastisement in that hard labour of theirs in which they continued as they supposed him to be alive which is in contrast to what they would have supposed had they known the Unseen and the fact that he had been there an entire year judging by how much of the staff the termite had eaten through after his death; in other words they would not have continued in the humiliating chastisement for a single day or even a single night longer."
