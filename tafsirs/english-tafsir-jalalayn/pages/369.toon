  26,40,"Maybe we will follow the sorcerers should they be the victors’ the interrogative of the previous verse is an incitement to assemble and the optative sense implicit in la‘alla is due to their anticipation of victory and hence their continued adherence to their religion and rejection of Moses."
  26,41,"So when the sorcerers came they said to Pharaoh ‘Shall we indeed read a-inna either by pronouncing both hamzas or by not pronouncing the second but in both cases inserting an alif have a reward if we were to be the victors?’"
  26,42,"He said ‘Yes of course! And you shall then be among those closest to me’."
  26,43,"Moses said to them after they had said to him Either you cast or we shall be the casters Q. 7115 ‘Cast what you have to cast’ — the command to do this signifies an authorisation for them to cast and a means whereby the truth will be made to prevail."
  26,44,"So they cast their ropes and their staffs and said ‘By the power of Pharaoh we shall surely be the victors!’"
  26,45,"Thereat Moses cast his staff and lo! it was swallowing talqafu one of the original two tā’ letters of taltaqifu has been assimilated what they had faked what they had transformed through illusion making their ropes and staffs appear to be moving serpents."
  26,46,"So the sorcerers fell down prostrating."
  26,47,"They said ‘We believe in the Lord of the Worlds"
  26,48,"the Lord of Moses and Aaron’ for they realised that what they had witnessed in the case of the staff could not have been the result of mere sorcery."
  26,49,"Pharaoh said ‘Do you believe a-āmantum read pronouncing both hamzas or replacing the second one with an alif him Moses though I have not given you leave? He is indeed your chief the one who has taught you sorcery — so that he only taught you some tricks and then surpassed you with others. Soon you will know what I will do with you! I will assuredly cut off your hands and legs on opposite sides — in other words the right hand of each one together with his left leg — then I shall surely crucify you all.’"
  26,50,"They said ‘There is no harm in that no damage will be done to us thereby. Surely to our Lord after we die whichever way that may be we shall return in the Hereafter."
  26,51,"Indeed We hope our Lord will forgive us our iniquities for being the first to believe’ in our time."
  26,52,"And We revealed to Moses after many years which he spent among them calling them to the truth with God’s signs but all of which only increased them in insolence saying ‘Journey with My servants the Children of Israel by night a variant reading for an asri is an isr from the verb sarā one form of asrā go with them by night in the direction of the sea for indeed you will be pursued’. Pharaoh and his armies will pursue you but when they enter the sea in pursuit of you I will deliver you and drown them."
  26,53,"Then Pharaoh having been informed of their night departure sent to the cities — it is said that he ruled a thousand cities and twelve thousand villages — musterers to assemble the army saying"
  26,54,"‘Lo! these are but a small gang. It is said that they the Children of Israel numbered 670000 while his Pharaoh’s vanguard alone numbered 700000 and so he deemed their number insignificant in comparison to his huge army."
  26,55,"And indeed they have enraged us their actions infuriate us"
  26,56,"and indeed we are all on our guard’ ready a variant reading for hadhirūna has hādhirūn meaning ‘alert’."
  26,57,"God exalted be He says So We made them Pharaoh and his folk go forth out of Egypt in order to pursue Moses and his people from gardens orchards on either side of the Nile and springs streams running from the Nile through their dwellings"
  26,58,"and treasures visible riches of gold and silver — these riches are called kunūz as opposed to amwāl ‘riches’ because that portion which is always due to God exalted be He from them had not been paid — and splendid places exquisite residences for princes and ministers surrounded by their retinues."
  26,59,"So it was that is Our expulsion of them was as We have described and We made the Children of Israel to inherit these after drowning Pharaoh and his folk."
  26,60,"Then they pursued them they caught them up at sunrise."
