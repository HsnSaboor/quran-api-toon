tafsir[5]{c,v,t}:
  2,89,"When there came to them a Book from God confirming what was with them in the Torah that is the Qur’ān — and they formerly before it came prayed for victory for assistance over the disbelievers saying ‘God give us assistance against them through the Prophet that shall be sent at the end of time’; but when there came to them what they recognised as the truth that is the mission of the Prophet they disbelieved in it out of envy and for fear of losing leadership the response to the first lammā particle is indicated by the response to the second one; and the curse of God is on the disbelievers."
  2,90,"Evil is that for which they sell their souls that is their share of the reward in the Hereafter bi’samā ‘evil is that for which’ mā here is an indefinite particle representing ‘a thing’ and constitutes a specification qualifying the subject of the verb bi’s ‘evil is’ the very thing being singled out for criticism; that they disbelieve in that Qur’ān which God has revealed grudging baghyan here is an object denoting reason for yakfurū ‘they disbelieve’ that is out of envy that God should reveal read either yunzil or yunazzil of His bounty the Inspiration to whomever He will of His servants to deliver the Message; and they were laden they returned with anger from God for their disbelief in what He has revealed the indefinite form bi-ghadabin ‘with anger’ is used to emphasise the awesomeness of the ‘anger’ upon anger which they deserved formerly when they neglected the Torah and disbelieved in Jesus; and for the disbelievers there shall be a humiliating chastisement."
  2,91,"And when it was said to them ‘Believe in what God has revealed that is the Qur’ān and other Books they said ‘We believe in what was revealed to us’ that is the Torah; and wā here indicates a circumstantial qualifier they disbelieve in what is beyond that what is other than that or what came afterwards such as the Qur’ān; yet it is the truth wa-huwa’l-haqqu is a circumstantial qualifier confirming musaddiqan a second circumstantial qualifier for emphasis what is with them. Say to them ‘Why then were you slaying the prophets of God formerly if you were believers?’ in the Torah and in it you were forbidden to kill them this address concerning what their forefathers did is directed towards those present at the time of our Prophet on account of their approval of it that is of what the forefathers had done."
  2,92,"And Moses came to you with clear proofs miracles such as the staff his hand and the parting of the sea; then you took to yourselves the calf as a god after him after he had gone to the appointment and you were evildoers for taking it in worship."
  2,93,"And when We made a covenant with you to act according to what is in the Torah and raised over you the Mount to drop it on you when you had refused to accept it; We said ‘Take forcefully seriously and with effort what We have given you and listen’ to what you have been commanded and be prepared to accept it They said ‘We hear your words and disobey’ your command; and they were made to drink the calf in their hearts that is to say the love of it the golden calf intoxicated their hearts in the way that wine does on account of their unbelief. Say to them ‘Evil is that thing which your belief in the Torah enjoins on you in the way of the worship of the golden calf if you are believers’ in it as you claim; meaning you are not believers for faith does not command that you worship the calf — their forefathers are meant here. Likewise you do not believe in the Torah because you have denied the prophethood of Muhammad (s) whereas faith in it does not command you to reject him."
