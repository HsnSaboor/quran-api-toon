  21,74,"And to Lot We gave judgement the ability to judge decisively between opposing parties and knowledge; and We delivered him from the town which had been committing that is whose inhabitants had been committing deeds of vileness by way of homosexual intercourse hazelnut-hurling and bird-games and other things.

  21,75,"And We admitted him into Our mercy by Our saving him from his people. He was indeed one of the righteous."
  21,76,"And mention Noah what follows Nūhan substitutes for it when he called when he supplicated to God against his people — with the words My Lord do not leave upon the earth any inhabitant from among the disbelievers … to the end of the verse Q. 7126 before that is before the time of Abraham and Lot. And We responded to him and delivered him and his people who were in the Ark with him from the great agony namely from drowning and his people’s denial of him."

  21,78,"And mention David and Solomon that is mention their story Dāwūda wa-Sulaymāna is substituted by the following idh yahkumāni … when they gave judgement concerning the tillage a field of crops or a vineyard when the sheep of a certain people strayed into it that is when these sheep grazed there at night but without a shepherd because they had escaped; and We were witnesses to their judgement li-hukmihim shāhidīna here the plural person is being used in the case of a dual. David decreed to the owner of the tillage belong the head of the sheep.

And to each of the twain We gave judgement prophethood and knowledge in matters of religion. And We disposed the mountains to glorify God with David and the birds also were disposed to glorify God with him for he David had commanded such glorification on their part so that whenever there was a lapse on his part he would be reminded to apply himself to the task of glorifying God promptly. And We were certainly doers of this disposing of them to glorify God along with him even if it should amaze you that they should be able to respond to the lord David."

Will you then O people of Mecca be thankful? for My favours by believing in the Messenger — in other words be thankful to Me by doing this."
  21,81,"And We disposed for Solomon the wind to blow strongly — in another verse it is described as being rukhā’an ‘to blow softly’ Q. 3836; in other words it is either blowing violently or gently respectively according to what he Solomon wanted — making its way at his command to the land which We have blessed namely Syria; and We have knowledge of all things among them the fact that God exalted be He knew that what He gave to Solomon would prompt him to be subservient to his Lord and so God did this in accordance with His knowledge."
