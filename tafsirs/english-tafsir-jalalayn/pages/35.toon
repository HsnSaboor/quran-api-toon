tafsir[5]{c,v,t}:
  2,220,"on the matters of this world and the Hereafter and follow what is best for you in both. They will ask you about orphans and the distress their affair caused them for if they became intimate with them they may slip into error but if they put aside the money due to them and prepare their meals for them separately this would distress them. Say ‘To set their affairs aright in terms of their funds by looking after it and your mingling with them is better’ than you not doing this; and if you intermix with them your funds and theirs they are your brothers in religion and it is only natural for one to intermix his affair with his brother so you do too; God knows well him who works corruption in their property when he intermixes with them from him who sets it aright and God will requite both; and had He willed He would have harassed you and made it difficult for you by prohibiting you from intermixing with them. Surely God is Mighty victorious in His affair Wise in His actions."
  2,221,"O Muslims Do not marry idolatresses disbelievers until they believe; a believing slavegirl is better than an idolatress who may be a free woman; this was revealed as a rebuttal of the idea that it was shameful to marry a slavegirl and that it was better to marry an idolatress free woman; though you may admire her because of her beauty and wealth this provision excludes the womenfolk of the People of the Scripture as indicated by the verse Q. 55 lawful to you are the chaste women among those who were given the Scripture. And do not marry off believing women to idolaters until they believe. A believing slave is better than an idolater though you may admire him for his wealth and good looks. Those the people of idolatry call to the Fire because they invite one to perform deeds that merit this and for this reason one should not marry with them; and God calls through the voice of His prophets to Paradise and pardon that is to the deeds that merit these two by His leave by His will so that His call may be heeded by marrying with His friends; and He makes clear His signs to the people so that they might remember that they might be admonished."
  2,222,"They will ask you about the monthly period that is menstruation and the spot in which it occurs and how should one treat women during it. Say ‘It is an ailment filth or the place whence it issues is so; so part with women refrain from sexual intercourse with them in the monthly period in this time or in the part affected; and do not approach them for sexual intercourse until they are pure yathurna or yattahharna the original tā’ of yatatahharna has been assimilated with the tā’ that is until they have cleansed themselves after its cessation; when they have cleansed themselves then come to them in sexual intercourse as God has commanded you’ by avoiding it the female organ during menstruation and not resorting to any other part. Truly God loves that is He rewards and honours those who repent of sins and He loves those who cleanse themselves from impurities."
  2,223,"Your women are a tillage for you that is the place where you sow the seeds of your children; so come to your tillage that is the specified place the front part as in whichever way you wish whether standing up sitting down lying down from the front or the back this was revealed in response to the Jews saying that if a person had vaginal intercourse with his wife from behind the child would be born cross-eyed; and offer for your souls righteous deeds such as saying ‘In the Name of God’ bismillāh when you commence intercourse; and fear God in what He commands and prohibits; and know that you shall meet Him at the Resurrection where He will requite you according to your deeds; and give good tidings of Paradise to the believers who feared Him."
  2,224,"Do not make God by swearing in His Name a hindrance a cause of impediment in your oaths that is setting up such impediments by swearing in His Name frequently so as not to be pious and God-fearing; in such instances oaths are hateful and result in perjury which requires a redemption effected by doing the opposite of the oath such as performing righteous deeds and so forth which constitute an act of obedience; and to put things right between people this means do not be prevented from doing righteous deeds as mentioned just because you swore against them; nay do them and make redemption; this understanding of the verse is justified by the reason for its revelation namely their refraining from such deeds; surely God is All-Hearing of what you say Knower of your circumstances."
