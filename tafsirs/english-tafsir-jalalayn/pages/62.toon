  3,92,"You will not attain piety that is the reward for it which is Paradise until you expend until you give voluntary alms of what you love of your wealth; and whatever thing you expend God knows of it and He will requite it accordingly."
  3,93,"When the Jews said to the Prophet ‘You claim that you follow the creed of Abraham but Abraham did not eat camel’s meat nor drink its milk’ the following was revealed All food was lawful to the Children of Israel save what Israel Jacob forbade for himself namely camels when he was afflicted with sciatica ‘irq al-nasā he made a vow that if he were cured he would not eat of it again and so it was forbidden him; before the Torah was revealed which was after the time of Abraham as it was not unlawful in his time as they claimed. Say to them ‘Bring the Torah now and recite it so that the truth of what you say may become clear if you are truthful’ in what you say; they were stupified and did not bring it the Torah. God exalted be He then said"
  3,94,"Whoever invents falsehood against God after that that is after the proof has become manifest that the prohibition was made by Jacob and not during the time of Abraham those are the evildoers that transgress the truth into falsehood."
  3,95,"Say ‘God has spoken the truth in this matter just as He has in all that He has related; therefore follow the creed of Abraham the one which I follow a hanīf inclining away from all religions towards submission islām and he was not an idolater’."
  3,96,"When they said ‘Our direction of prayer qibla came before yours’ the following was revealed The first house for worship established for the people on earth was that at Bakka a variant of Makka Mecca so called because it ‘crushes’ tabukku the necks of tyrants; it was built by the angels before the creation of Adam and after it the Aqsā in Jerusalem was built a period of forty years separating them as reported in the hadīth of the two Sahīhs sc. of al-Bukhārī and Muslim and in the hadīth that states ‘The first thing to appear on the surface of the water at the creation of the heavens and the earth was a white foam underneath which the earth was unrolled’; a blessed place mubārakan a circumstantial qualifier referring to la’lladhī ‘that’ meaning a place of blessings and a guidance to all worlds because it is their qibla."
  3,97,"Therein are clear signs among which is the station of Abraham that is the stone upon which he stood to build the House and on which his footprints remain; and it the House has endured all this length of time and the constant passing of hands over it. Among these signs are the fact that the reward for good deeds is multiplied in it and that birds never fly over it; and whoever enters it is in security not liable therein to be killed or oppressed or otherwise. It is the duty of people towards God to make the pilgrimage to the House read either as hijj al-bayt or hajj al-bayt as two variants of the verbal noun from hajj meaning ‘the intention to journey there’ if he is able to make his way there man istatā‘a ilayhi sabīlan substitutes for al-nās ‘people’. The Prophet s explained this ability as having provisions and a ride as reported by al-Hākim al-Naysābūrī and others. As for the one who disbelieves in God or in what He has made obligatory with regard to the Pilgrimage God is Independent of all worlds the humans the jinn and the angels and is Independent of their devotions."

God is not heedless of what you do’ in the way of unbelief and mendacity; instead He gives you respite until your appointed time and then requites you."
