tafsir[13]{c,v,t}:
  36,71,"Or have they not seen have they not realised the interrogative is meant as an affirmative and the wāw inserted therein in a-wa-lam is for supplementation that We have created for them and for all human beings of what Our hands worked of what We have made without any partner or helper cattle namely camels cows and sheep so that they are their owners? masters controlling them."
  36,72,"And We have subdued We have disposed these cattle for them so that some of them provide rides for them and some of them they eat."
  36,73,"And there are other benefits for them therein such as their wool fur and hairs and drinks made from their milk mashārib is the plural of mashrab meaning shurb ‘a drink’; or what is meant is the place from which the drink issues. Will they not then give thanks? to the One Who has bestowed these graces upon them and so become believers? In other words they do not do any of this."
  36,74,"And they have taken besides God in other words other than Him other gods idols which they worship that perhaps they might be helped protected against God’s chastisement by their gods’ interceding for them as they are wont to claim."
  36,75,"They their gods cannot help them — they are being treated as though they were rational beings — and they their idol gods are their host as they claim their supporters ever-present but in the Fire together with them."
  36,76,"So do not be grieved by their remarks to you that you have not been sent by God and otherwise. Assuredly We know what they conceal and what they proclaim in this respect and otherwise and We will requite them accordingly."
  36,77,"Or has man — namely the like of al-‘Āsī b. Wā’il — not seen has he not realised that We created him from a drop of sperm and so on in stages until We made him powerful and strong. Then lo! he is an open adversary severely antagonistic towards Us openly making this manifest by his denial of resurrection."
  36,78,"And he strikes for Us a similitude in this respect and forgets the manner of his creation from a sperm-drop a thing more curious than his similitude; he says ‘Who will revive the bones when they are rot?’ in other words when they have become withered He does not say ramīmatun ‘decayed’ because it ramīmun ‘rot’ is a noun and not an adjective. It is reported that he al-‘Āsī took some withered bones and crushed them into pieces and said to the Prophet s ‘Do you think that God can revive these bones after they have decayed and become rot?’ And so the Prophet s said ‘Yes indeed! And He will also throw you into the Fire’."
  36,79,"Say ‘He will revive them Who originated them the first time and He is Knower of all creation of every single creature generally and in detail before and after it has been created —"
  36,80,"He Who has made for you and for all human beings fire from the green tree namely from the markh and ‘afār variety or from all trees except for the jujube ‘unnāb and behold from it you kindle’ from it you strike fire this is proof of the power of God to resurrect for in this example of the green tree He has combined the elements of water fire and wood; but neither the water extinguishes the fire nor does the fire ignite the wood."
  36,81,"Is not He Who created the heavens and the earth in all their immensity able to create the like of them? namely human beings in all their minuteness? Yes indeed He is able to do this — God Himself replies here. And He is the Creator khallāq means Creator of many things the Knower of all things."
  36,82,"His command His affair when He wills a thing that is when He will to create something is just to say to it ‘Be’ and it is a variant reading for fa-yakūnu has fa-yakūna as a supplement to yaqūla ‘to say’."
  36,83,"So glory be to Him in Whose hand is the dominion of all things malakūt means mulk the wāw and tā’ have been added for hyperbole and to Whom you will be returned restored in the Hereafter."
