tafsir[7]{c,v,t}:
  24,21,"O you who believe do not follow in the steps of Satan that is his ways of making things seem attractive. For whoever follows in the steps of Satan assuredly he the one being followed enjoins indecency that is he enjoins vile acts and what is reprehensible if followed according to the Law. And were it not for God’s bounty to you and His mercy not one of you O band of accusers would ever have grown pure after the calumny of which you spoke that is to say not one of you would have ever been reformed or purified from this sin by repenting of it. But God purifies whom He will from sin by accepting his repentance from him and God is Hearer of what you have said Knower of your intentions."
  24,22,"And do not let those of you who possess bounty the wealthy and the affluent swear not to give to the near of kin and the poor and those who emigrate in the way of God — this was revealed regarding Abū Bakr who swore to provide no more for Mistah his maternal cousin a destitute Emigrant who had fought at the battle of Badr because of his involvement in the calumny when thitherto he had provided for him. And it was revealed also regarding certain Companions who swore not to give voluntary alms to those who had participated in spreading the calumny in any way. Let them forgive and excuse them in this matter. Do you not love that God should forgive you? And God is Forgiving Merciful to believers. Abū Bakr said ‘Indeed. I would love that God forgive me’ and he restored thereafter to Mistah what he used to expend on him."
  24,23,"Truly those who make accusations of fornication against honourably married chaste women who are unaware of indecent acts — since it would never occur to them to commit such acts — who believe in God and His Messenger shall be cursed in this world and the Hereafter; and there will be an awful chastisement for them"
  24,24,"on the day yawma is in the accusative because of the implicit sense of ‘permanence’ to which lahum ‘for them’ is semantically connected when their tongues and their hands and their feet shall testify against them read feminine person tashhadu or masculine person yashhadu ‘testify’ concerning what they used to do in terms of speech and action — this day is the Day of Resurrection."
  24,25,"On that day God will pay them in full their just due He will requite them with the requital they deserve and they shall know that God is the Manifest Truth since He will have realised for them that requital of His whereof they had been in doubt. Among such people is ‘Abd Allāh b. Ubayy. The ‘honourable women’ mentioned above are the Prophet’s s wives regarding whom no repentance has been mentioned as being possible in the case of their being falsely accused; those women regarding whom repentance has been mentioned however at the beginning of the sūra verses 4-5 in the case of their being falsely accused are women other these wives of the Prophet."
  24,26,"Vile women and vile words are for vile men and vile men for vile women and the mentioned vile words. Good women and as mentioned good words are for good men and good men for good women and the mentioned good words that is to say what suits something vile is its like and what suits something good is its like — such good men and women the like of ‘Ā’isha and Safwān are absolved of what they say what the corrupt men and women say about them. For them for good men and women will be forgiveness and a glorious provision in Paradise. ‘Ā’isha felt honoured by some of the things mentioned in this verse namely that she was created ‘a good woman’ and was promised ‘forgiveness and a glorious provision’."
  24,27,"O you who believe do not enter houses other than your houses until you have first asked permission and greeted their occupants. So a person must say ‘Peace be upon you may I enter?’ as is stated in one hadīth. That is better for you than entering without permission that perhaps you might remember tadhakkarūna the second tā’ of tatadhakkarūna has been assimilated with the dhāl the superiority of such conduct and so follow it."
