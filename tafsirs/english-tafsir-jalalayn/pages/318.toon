  20,88,"Then he produced for them a calf which he fashioned from the melted trinkets — a mere body of flesh and blood with a low in other words it made a sound that was audible; it was transformed into such a state because of the dust from Gabriel’s steed the effect of which is to create life in whatever thing it is placed. After he had fashioned it he placed it the dust in its mouth. And they namely the Samaritan and his followers said ‘This is your God and the God of Moses so he Moses forgot’ his Lord here and set off in search of him. God exalted be He says"
  20,89,"Did they not see that in allā an has been softened in place of the hardened form with its subject omitted in other words it should be annahu it the Calf did not reciprocate their words that is that it did not give them any response in return nor did it have any power over hurt for them that is any power to prevent it or any benefit? that is any power to procure it for them in other words how can such a thing be taken as a god?"
  20,90,"And Aaron had certainly said to them beforehand that is before the return of Moses ‘O my people you are only being tested thereby! But truly your Lord is the Compassionate One so follow me in worship of Him and obey my command’ therein."
  20,91,"They said ‘We will not cease to cling to it persisting in worship of it until Moses returns to us’."
  20,92,"He Moses said upon his return ‘O Aaron what held you back when you saw them going astray by worshipping it"
  20,93,"that allā read an instead the lā being extra you did not follow me? Did you then disobey my command?’ by remaining among those who worship something other than God exalted be He?"
  20,94,"He Aaron said ‘O son of my mother read ya’bna’ummi or ya’bna’umma meaning ummī ‘my mother’ the mention of her is more effective in provoking the affection of his heart — do not clutch my beard which he had seized with his left hand or my head! for he had seized his hair with his right hand in anger. Indeed I feared that if I followed you for inevitably a group of those who did not worship the calf would have followed me you would have said “You have caused division among the Children of Israel — and have been furious with me — and you did not wait for my word”’ concerning what my opinion would have been in this matter."
  20,95,"He said ‘And what have you to say what was the motive for doing what you did O Samaritan?’"
  20,96,"He said ‘I perceived what they did not perceive read either as third person plural yabsurū or as second person plural tabsurū ‘what you did not perceive’ in other words I realised what they did not realise so I seized a handful of dust from the track of from the hoof of the steed of the messenger Gabriel and threw it in I cast it onto the figure of the calf that had been fashioned. Thus my soul prompted thus it adorned for me’ and it was cast into me the idea that I seize a handful of the dust from that mentioned hoof and cast it onto what possessed no spirit so that it might thus acquire a spirit. I had seen that your people had asked that you make for them a god and so my soul suggested to me the idea that this calf should be their god."
  20,97,"Said he Moses to him ‘Begone! It shall be yours as your lot throughout life that is for the duration of your life to say to whomever you may see “Do not touch me!” that is do not come near me — he used to wander about aimlessly throughout the land and whenever he touched a person or a person touched him both would succumb to a fever. And indeed there will be a tryst for you for you to be chastised which you will not fail to keep read lan tukhlifahu meaning ‘a tryst which you shall not miss’; or lan tukhlafahu ‘for which you will not be forgotten’ meaning ‘nay you will be sent forth to keep it’. Now look at your god to whom you remained clinging! zalta is actually zalilta but the first lām has been omitted in order to soften it that is to say you remained by his your god’s side worshipping him. We will surely burn it in fire and then scatter the ashes of it into the waters we will disperse it into the winds of the sea; and after having slaughtered it Moses did exactly that which he has mentioned."
  20,98,"Indeed your God is the One God than whom there is no other god. He embraces all things in His knowledge’ ‘ilman a specification derived from the subject of the verb in other words it means ‘His knowledge embraces all things’."
