tafsir[26]{c,v,t}:
  92,15,"which none shall enter but the wretched one al-ashqā means al-shaqī"
  92,16,"he who denies the Prophet and turns away from faith — this delimiting of those who deserve to enter this fire constitutes an interpretation of His saying But He forgives other than that to whomever He will Q. 448 which in turn suggests that what is meant is that entry into the Fire which will be everlasting."
  92,17,"The God-fearing one al-atqā means al-taqī shall be spared it he will be removed far away from it"
  92,18,"he who gives his wealth to purify himself offering it as a means of self purification before God exalted be He by making this payment for the sake of God exalted be He and not for show or the sake of reputation so that he or the offering stands purified in the sight of God. This verse was revealed regarding the truthful one al-siddīq Abū Bakr may God be pleased with him when he purchased Bilāl the Ethiopian who was being tortured on account of his faith and then freed him whereat the disbelievers said ‘He only did this in return for a favour which he must have owed him’ and so the following was revealed"
  92,19,"and no one has any favour outstanding with him that must be requited;"
  92,20,"but he did this only seeking the pleasure of his Lord the Most High that is to say only seeking to secure God’s reward;"
  92,21,"and verily soon he shall himself be pleased with the reward he will be given in Paradise. The verse applies equally to anyone who may do as he Abū Bakr did may God be pleased with him and such a person will thereby be removed far from the Fire and rewarded."
  93,1,"By the forenoon that is to say the first part of the day or all of it"
  93,2,"and by the night when it is still — or sajā can mean ‘when it envelops all in its darkness’."
  93,3,"Your Lord has neither forsaken you He has not abandoned you O Muhammad (s) nor does He hate you this was revealed when after the revelation had not come to him for fifteen days the disbelievers said ‘His Lord has parted with him and hates him’."
  93,4,"And verily the Hereafter shall be better for you by virtue of the honours awaiting you thereat than the first life this world."
  93,5,"And verily your Lord shall give you in the Hereafter of good things a bounteous gift and you shall be satisfied with it — and so the Prophet s said ‘In that case I shall not be satisfied if a single person from among my community remains in the Fire’ the response to the oath terminates here with two affirmations and two negations."
  93,6,"Did He not find you an orphan an interrogative meant as an affirmative in other words He did indeed find you an orphan having lost your father before you were born or shortly thereafter and shelter you? by having your uncle Abū Tālib embrace you as part of his household."
  93,7,"And did He not find you erring from the revealed Law which you now follow and guided you? that is and then guided you to it."
  93,8,"And did He not find you needy poor and enrich you? and made you content with the spoils and other things which He gave you — in a hadīth it is stated ‘Wealth comes not from the proliferation of transient worldly goods but wealth comes from the contentedness of the soul’."
  93,9,"So as for the orphan do not oppress him by appropriating his wealth or otherwise"
  93,10,"and as for the beggar do not drive him away do not repel him on account of his poverty"
  93,11,"and as for your Lord’s grace to you by way of prophethood and otherwise proclaim it make it known. The omission in certain instances of the suffixed pronoun referring to the Prophet s from the end of the verbs is intended to sustain the end-rhyme of the verses."
  94,1,"Did We not expand an interrogative meant as an affirmative in other words ‘We did indeed expand’ your breast for you O Muhammad (s) by means of prophethood and otherwise"
  94,2,"and relieve you of your burden"
  94,3,"that which weighed down your back? — this is similar to where God says that God may forgive you what is past of your sin Q. 482."
  94,4,"Did We not exalt your mention? For you are mentioned where I God am mentioned in the call announcing the time for prayer adhān in the second call to perform the prayer iqāma in the witnessing ‘there is no god but God Muhammad is His Messenger’ tashahhud in the Friday sermon and in other instances."
  94,5,"For truly with hardship comes ease."
  94,6,"Truly with hardship comes ease the Prophet s suffered much hardship at the hands of the disbelievers but then he enjoyed ease when he was assisted to victory by God over them."
  94,7,"So when you are finished from performing prayer toil exert yourself in supplication to God"
  94,8,"and seek devote yourself humbly to your Lord."
