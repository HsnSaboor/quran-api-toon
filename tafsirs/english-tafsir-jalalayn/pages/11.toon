tafsir[7]{c,v,t}:
  2,70,"They said ‘Pray to your Lord for us that He make clear to us what she may be does it graze freely or is it used in labour?; the cows that is the species described in the way mentioned are all alike to us because there are many of them and we have not been able to find the one sought after; and if God wills we shall then be guided’ to it. In one hadīth it is reported ‘Had they not uttered the proviso inshā’a Llāh it would never have been made clear to them’."
  2,71,"He said ‘He says she shall be a cow not broken not subdued for labour that is to plough the earth churning its soil for sowing tuthīr al-ard the clause describes the word dhalūl and constitutes part of the negation; or to water the tillage that is the land prepared for sowing; one safe from faults and the effects of toil; with no blemish of a colour other than her own on her’. They said ‘Now you have brought the truth’ that is now you have explained it clearly; they thus sought it out and found it with a boy very dutiful towards his mother and they eventually purchased it for the equivalent of its weight in gold; and so they sacrificed her even though they very nearly did not on account of its excessive cost. In a hadīth it is stated that ‘Had they sacrificed any cow it would have sufficed them but they made it difficult for themselves and so God made it difficult for them’."
  2,72,"And when you killed a living soul and disputed thereon iddāra’tum the tā’ of the root-form itdāra’tum has been assimilated with the dāl — and God disclosed what you were hiding this is a parenthetical statement; the story begins here with wa-idh qataltum nafsan ‘and when you killed a soul’… and continues in the following"
  2,73,"so We said ‘Smite him the slain man with part of it’ and so when he was struck with its tongue or its tail he came back to life and said ‘So-and-so killed me’ and after pointing out two of his cousins he died; the two killers were denied the inheritance and were later killed. God says even so is the revival for God brings to life the dead and He shows you His signs the proofs of His power so that you might understand that you might reflect and realise that the One capable of reviving a single soul is also capable of reviving a multitude of souls and then believe."
  2,74,"Then your hearts became hardened O you Jews they your hearts became stiffened against acceptance of the truth thereafter that is after what is mentioned of the bringing back to life of the slain man and the other signs before this; and they are like stones in their hardness or even yet harder than these; for there are stones from which rivers come gushing and others split yashshaqqaq the initial tā’ of the root-form yatashaqqaq has been assimilated with the shīn so that water issues from them; and others come down from on high in fear of God while your hearts are unmoved unstirred and not humbled; And God is not heedless of what you do but instead He gives you respite until your time comes ta‘malūna ‘you do’ a variant reading has ya‘malūna ‘they do’ indicating a shift to the third person address."
  2,75,"Are you then so eager O believers that they the Jews should believe you seeing there is a party of them a group of their rabbis that heard God’s word in the Torah and then tampered with it changing it and that after they had comprehended it after they had understood it knowingly? knowing full well that they were indulging in mendacity the hamza at the beginning of the verb a-fa-tatma‘ūn is an interrogative for rejection in other words ‘Do not be so eager for they have disbelieved before’."
  2,76,"And when they the hypocrites from among the Jews meet those who believe they say ‘We believe’ that Muhammad (s) is a prophet and that he is the one of whom we have been given good tidings in our Book; but when they go in private one to another they their leaders the ones not involved in the hypocrisy say to those hypocrites ‘Do you speak to them the believers of what God has disclosed to you that is what He has made known to you of Muhammad’s s description in the Torah so that they may thereby dispute the lām of li-yuhājjūkum ‘that they may dispute with you’ is the lām of ‘becoming’ with you before your Lord? in the Hereafter and hold the proof against you for not following him Muhammad (s) despite your knowledge of his sincerity? Have you no understanding?’ of the fact that they will contend with you if you speak to them in this way? So beware."
