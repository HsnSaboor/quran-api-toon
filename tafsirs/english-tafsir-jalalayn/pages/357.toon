  24,54,"Say ‘Obey God and obey the Messenger.’ But if you turn away from obedience to him tawallaw ‘you turn away’ one of the two tā’ letters in tatawallaw has been omitted; an address to them know that he is only responsible for that with which he has been charged of conveying the Message and you are responsible for that with which you have been charged of obedience to him. And if you obey him you will be rightly guided. And the Messenger’s duty is only to convey the Message clearly’."
  24,55,"God has promised those of you who believe and perform righteous deeds that He will surely make them successors in the earth in place of the disbelievers just as He made those Children of Israel who were before them successors in place of the ruling tyrants the verb may be read as active istakhlafa ‘He made them successors’ or as passive istukhlifa ‘were made successors’ and He will surely establish for them their religion which He has approved for them namely the religion of Islam by making it prevail over all religions and enrich them throughout the land so that they become masters thereof and that He will give them in exchange read wa-la-yubdilannahum or wa-la-yubaddilannahum after their fear of disbelievers security. And God fulfilled His promise to them in the way mentioned and He praises them with His words ‘They worship Me without associating anything with Me’ ya‘budūnanī lā yushrikūna bī shay’an is an independent new sentence standing as a justification for His promise. And whoever is ungrateful after that bestowal of grace from among them whoever is ungrateful for it those they are the immoral. The first to show ingratitude for that grace of God were the murderers of ‘Uthmān b. ‘Affān may God be pleased with him and they began to kill one another henceforth after having been brothers."
  24,56,"And establish prayer and pay the alms and obey the Messenger that perhaps you may find mercy that is to say do so hoping for mercy."
  24,57,"And do not suppose read tahsabanna or yahsabanna the subject of the verb being the Messenger that those who disbelieve can escape Us in the land by eluding us. For their abode will be their return will be to the Fire and it is surely an evil destination it is an evil place of return."
  24,58,"O you who believe let those whom your right hands own of male slaves and female slaves and those of you who have not reached puberty from among the free men and who have not become sexually aware of women ask leave of you three times at three times of the day before the dawn prayer and when you put off your garments at noon and after the night prayer. These are three periods of privacy for you read thalāthu ‘awrātin lakum with nominative inflection as the predicate of an implied subject followed by a genitive annexation with the annexed term standing in place thereof of the predicate in other words the implied predicate followed by the annexation is hiya awqāt ‘these are times of …’; or read thalātha ‘awrātin lakum in the accusative the implication being that awqāta is itself in the accusative as a substitute for the syntactical status of what precedes it in place of which stands the annexed term. It is because clothes are taken off that private parts are revealed during such periods. Neither you nor they namely slaves and young boys would be at fault in entering upon you without asking leave at other times that is after the three times of day specified; they frequent you to provide service as some of you do with others this sentence corroborates the preceding one. So just as He has clarified what has been mentioned God clarifies for you the signs the rulings; and God is Knower of the affairs of His creatures Wise in what He has ordained for them. It is said that the ‘permission’ verse āyat al-isti’idhān was abrogated; but it is also said that it was not abrogated but that people thought little of neglecting to seek permission in such situations."
