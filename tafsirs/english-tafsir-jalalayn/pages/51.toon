  3,10,"As for the disbelievers neither their riches nor their children will avail will protect them against God that is against His chastisement; those — they shall be fuel for the Fire they shall constitute what the Fire will be fuelled by read waqūd as opposed to wuqūd ‘fuel’."
  3,11,"Their way is as the way as the habit of Pharaoh’s folk and the communities of people before them such as ‘Ād and Thamūd who denied Our signs; God seized them He destroyed them for their sins this statement explains the previous one; God is severe in retribution."
  3,12,"When the Prophet s enjoined the Jews to enter into Islam after his return from Badr they said ‘Do not fool yourself just because you killed a few men of Quraysh inexperienced and knowing nothing about fighting’ whereupon the following was revealed Say O Muhammad (s) to the disbelievers from among the Jews ‘You shall be vanquished sa-tughlabūn or read sa-yughlabūn ‘they shall be vanquished’ in this world through being killed or taken captive and made to pay the jizya which actually took place and mustered read in both ways wa-tuhsharūna ‘you will be mustered’ or wa-yuhsharūna ‘they will be mustered’ in the Hereafter to Hell which you shall enter — an evil cradling!’ an evil resting place."
  3,13,"There has already been a sign an example the verb qad kāna ‘there has been’ is used to separate the statement to follow from the previous one for you in two hosts two parties that met one another in battle on the day of Badr; one company fighting in the way of God in obedience to Him namely the Prophet and his Companions who numbered three hundred and thirteen men most of them on foot with two horses six plates of armour and eight swords; and another unbelieving; they the disbelievers numbering almost a thousand saw them the Muslims twice the like of them that is more numerous than themselves as the eye sees in manifest vision witnessing; and God granted them victory despite their fewer number; for God confirms He strengthens with His help whom He will granting him victory. Surely in that which is mentioned is a lesson for people of vision those who are discerning so will you not be warned by this and become believers?"
  3,14,"Beautified for mankind is love of lusts that which the self lusts after and calls for beautified by Satan or by God as a test — of women children stored-up heaps of gold and silver horses of mark fine horses cattle namely camels cows and sheep and tillage the cultivation of land. That which is mentioned is the comfort of the life of this world enjoyed while it lasts but then perishes; but God — with Him is the more excellent abode place of return which is Paradise and for this reason one should desire none other than this abode."
  3,15,"Say O Muhammad (s) to your people ‘Shall I tell you shall I inform you of something better than that? that which has been mentioned of lusts this interrogative is meant as an affirmative. For those that are fearful of idolatry with their Lord ‘inda rabbihim is the predicate the subject being the following jannātun…’ are Gardens underneath which rivers flow abiding therein decreed for them therein is eternal life when they enter it and spouses purified of menstruation and other impurities and beatitude read ridwān or rudwān meaning ‘much pleasure’ from God; and God is Seer knower of His servants requiting each of them according to his deeds."
