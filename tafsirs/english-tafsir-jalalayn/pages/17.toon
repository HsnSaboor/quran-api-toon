tafsir[7]{c,v,t}:
  2,106,"When the disbelievers began to deride the matter of abrogation saying that one day Muhammad enjoins his Companions to one thing and then the next day he forbids it God revealed And whatever verse mā is the conditional particle that has been revealed containing a judgement We abrogate either together with its recital or not that is only its judgement but its recital continues; there is a variant reading nunsikh meaning ‘Whatever verse We command you or Gabriel to abrogate’ or postpone so that We do not reveal the judgement contained in it and We withhold its recital or retain it in the Preserved Tablet; a variant reading of nunsi’hā is nunsihā from ‘to forget’ so ‘Whatever verse We abrogate or We make you forget that is We erase from your heart’; the response to the conditional sentence begun with mā is We bring in place a better one that is more beneficial for Our servants either because it is easier to implement or contains much reward; or the like of it in terms of religious obligation and reward; do you not know that God has power over all things? including abrogating and substituting verses? the interrogative here is meant as an affirmative."
  2,107,"Do you not know that to God belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth doing what He pleases and that you have none besides God other than God neither protector to safeguard you nor helper? to keep away His chastisement when it comes."
  2,108,"When the Meccans asked the Prophet to enlarge the size of Mecca and make Safā full of gold the following was revealed Or do you desire to question your Messenger as Moses was questioned by his people aforetime? when they asked him to show them God openly among other things; whoever exchanges belief for unbelief taking the latter in place of the former by refraining from contemplating the clear proofs and by requesting others instead has surely strayed from the even way meaning he has mistaken the proper path al-sawā‘ essentially means al-wasat ‘middle way’."
  2,109,"Many of the People of the Scripture long that law ‘if only that’ represents the import of the verbal noun they might make you disbelievers after you have believed from the envy hasadan is the object denoting reason being of their own souls that is to say their wicked souls have prompted them to this attitude; after the truth with regard to the Prophet s has become clear to them in the Torah; yet pardon leave them be and be forgiving stay away and make no encroachments against them till God brings His command concerning fighting them; truly God has power over all things."
  2,110,"And perform the prayer and pay the alms; whatever good in the way of obedience such as observing kinship and charity you shall offer for your own souls you shall find it that is its reward with God; assuredly God sees what you do and will requite you for it."
  2,111,"And they say ‘None shall enter Paradise except those who are Jews hūd is the plural of hā’id or Christians’ this is what the Jews of Medina and the Christians of Najrān said when they disputed with the Prophet s each party separately claiming Paradise for its members exclusively. Such sayings are their desires their false passions. Say to them ‘Produce your proof your evidence for this if you speak truly’ in this matter."
  2,112,"Nay but others will also enter Paradise namely whoever submits his purpose to God that is adheres to His commands wajh ‘face’ sc. ‘purpose’ is here mentioned because it is the most noble part of the body so that when it has submitted there is all the more reason for the other parts to follow being virtuous affirming God’s Oneness his reward is with his Lord the reward of his deeds being Paradise and no fear shall befall them neither shall they grieve in the Hereafter."
