And whoever turns away from the remembrance of his Lord from the Qur’ān We will admit him naslukhu or read first person yaslukhu ‘He will admit him’ into a tortuous chastisement."
  72,18,"And it has been revealed to me that the places of prayer belong to God so do not invoke in them anyone along with God by associating others with Him like the Jews and Christians do who when they enter their churches and temples they ascribe partners to God."

And whoever disobeys God and His Messenger concerning the affirmation of His Oneness and hence does not believe — indeed there will be for him the fire of Hell abiding khālidīna is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the person indicated by man ‘whoever’ in lahu ‘for him’ taking into account its plural import; it khālidīna is also an implied circumstantial qualifier in other words they shall enter it with their abiding having been preordained therein forever’."
