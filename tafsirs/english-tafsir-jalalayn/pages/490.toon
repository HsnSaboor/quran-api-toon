tafsir[12]{c,v,t}:
  43,11,"and Who sent down water from the heaven in measure that is to say in the measure that you require thereof and did not send it down in a deluge and We revived with it a dead land. Thus — like this revivification — will you be brought forth from your graves alive;"
  43,12,"and Who created the pairs the species all of them and made for you ships and cattle such as camels on which you ride the referential pronoun has been omitted here for brevity; it is genitive in the case of the first that is fīhi sc. tarkabūna fīhi ‘you ride in them’ and accusative in the case of the second sc. tarkabūnahā ‘you ride them’"
  43,13,"that you may sit that you may find a firm position upon their backs He has made the suffixed pronoun a masculine plural and rendered zahr ‘back’ plural because of the particle mā and its plural import; and then remember your Lord’s grace when you are settled on them and say ‘Glory be to Him Who has disposed this for us and we by ourselves were no match for it not capable of it."
  43,14,"And indeed it is to our Lord that we shall return’ to Him that we shall depart."
  43,15,"And they assign to Him from among His own servants a part when they say that the angels are God’s daughters — for a child is a part of its parent — even though the angels are like them servants of His exalted be He. Man such as the one who says the above-mentioned words is verily a manifest ingrate one whose ungratefulness is manifest and clear."
  43,16,"Or am has the significance of the hamza of denial; the ‘saying’ is implied in other words a-taqūlūna ‘or do you say that …’ He has adopted from all that He has created daughters for Himself and preferred you privileged you with sons? — that which is the necessary inference from what you claim and which by itself is an abomination."
  43,17,"And when one of them is given the good tidings of that which he has attributed to the Compassionate One of that which he has likened to Him by the ascription to Him of daughters — for a child is likened to its parent; in other words when one of them is informed that a daughter has been born to him his face becomes darkened transformed into one laden with anguish and he chokes inwardly filled with anguish so how can such a person then attribute daughters to Him? Exalted be He high above such claims."
  43,18,"What! a-wa contains both the hamza of denial and the conjunctive waw ‘and’ in other words ‘do they ascribe to God …’ one that is brought up amid trinkets ornaments and is incoherent in a dispute? unable to argue clearly because of an inherent inability in this respect as a result of that person belonging to the female sex."
  43,19,"And they have made the angels who are themselves servants of the Compassionate One females. Did they witness were they present at their creation? Their testimony to the effect that they are females will be written down and they will be questioned about it in the Hereafter wherefore punishment will ensue for them."
  43,20,"And they say ‘Had the Compassionate One so willed we would not have worshipped them’ the angels therefore our worship of them happens by His will and so He must be satisfied with it. God exalted be He says They do not have any knowledge of that which is said of His being satisfied with the worship of these angels; and they are only surmising inventing lies in this respect and so punishment will befall them as a result thereof."
  43,21,"Or have We brought them a scripture before that is before the Qur’ān that they should worship other than God so that they are holding fast to it? In other words this never happened."
  43,22,"Nay but they say ‘Lo! we found our fathers following a certain creed and we are indeed proceeding in their footsteps to be guided’ by them for they used to worship other than God."
