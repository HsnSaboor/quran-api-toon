tafsir[15]{c,v,t}:
  20,99,"Thus just as We have related to you O Muhammad (s) this story We relate to you some stories some accounts of what is past of communities and We have given you from Ourselves a Reminder a Qur’ān."
  20,100,"Whoever turns away from it and does not believe in it he shall indeed on the Day of Resurrection bear a burden a heavy load of sin;"
  20,101,"therein that is in the chastisement for such sin abiding. And evil for them on the Day of Resurrection is that burden! himlan a specification qualifying the person of the verb sā’a ‘evil’; the subject of derision the implied wizruhum ‘their sin’ has been omitted; the lām of lahum is explicative and substitutes for yawma’l-qiyāma ‘the Day of Resurrection."
  20,102,"The day the Trumpet is blown the Horn the Second Blast and We shall assemble the criminals the disbelievers on that day bruised in the eye along with their faces blackened."
  20,103,"They will whisper to one another speaking secretly amongst themselves ‘You have tarried in this world only ten nights’ with the full ten days."
  20,104,"We know very well what they will say regarding this matter — that is it is not as they say — when the justest the most upright of them in the way in this will say ‘You have tarried only a day’ they will deem their stay in this world as having been very brief on account of the terrors they will witness in the Hereafter."
  20,105,"They will question you concerning the mountains how will they be on the Day of Resurrection? Say to them ‘My Lord will scatter them as ashes by pulverising them into moving sand and dispersing them with the wind;"
  20,106,"then He will leave them a level hollow a flattened level surface"
  20,107,"wherein you will see neither crookedness neither slope nor any curving’ nor any rise."
  20,108,"On that day that is on the day the mountains are scattered as ashes they will follow that is mankind will follow after rising from their graves the Summoner to the Gathering by the call of his voice — this Summoner will be the archangel Isrāfīl and he will say ‘Forward to the parade before God!’ — there will be no deviation therein that is in the manner in which they follow him in other words they cannot but follow him. Voices will be hushed will become silent before the Compassionate One so that you hear nothing but a faint shuffle the light tread of feet walking towards the Gathering similar to the sound of the hoofs of camels as they pass."
  20,109,"On that day intercession will not profit anyone except intercession from him whom the Compassionate One permits that he intercede for such a person and whose word He approves that is to say because such an intercessor will say ‘there is no god but God’ lā ilāha illā’Llāh."
  20,110,"He knows what is before them of the affairs of the Hereafter and behind them of the affairs of this world and they do not comprehend such things in knowledge they have no knowledge of such things."
  20,111,"And faces shall be humbled they shall be submissive before the Living the Eternal Sustainer namely God; and he will certainly have failed he will have lost he who carries the burden of evildoing that is of idolatry."
  20,112,"But whoever does righteous deeds acts of obedience being a believer shall fear neither wrong by having his evil deeds increased nor injustice by having his good deeds diminished."
  20,113,"Thus kadhālika a supplement to the previous kadhālika naqussu ‘thus We relate’ Q. 2099 just as We have revealed what has been mentioned We have revealed it that is the Qur’ān as an Arabic Qur’ān and We have distributed We have repeated in it statements of threats so that they may fear associating others with God or it the Qur’ān may arouse in them a remembrance of the destruction of those communities before and may thus be admonished."
