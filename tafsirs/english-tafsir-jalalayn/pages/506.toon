tafsir[7]{c,v,t}:
  46,29,"And mention when We sent a company of jinn your way — the jinn of Nasībīn in Yemen or the jinn of Nineveh who were seven or nine and this was while the Prophet s was leading the dawn prayer with some of his Companions at Batn Nakhla as reported by the two Shaykhs al-Bukhārī and Muslim — to listen to the Qur’ān and when they were in its presence they said that is they said to one another ‘Listen carefully!’ concentrate in order to hear it carefully. Then when it was finished when he was finished reciting it they went back to their people to warn them to threaten their people with the chastisement from God if they do not believe — they had been Jews but then become Muslims."
  46,30,"They said ‘O our people! Indeed we have heard a Book namely the Qur’ān which has been revealed after Moses confirming what was before it what preceded it such as the Torah. It guides to the truth submission to God islām and to a straight way that is the way thereto to Islam."
  46,31,"O our people! Respond to God’s summoner Muhammad (s) by embracing faith and believe in him and He God will forgive you some of your sins because some of these sins are wrongs done to others and which therefore can only be forgiven after those wronged are reconciled — and shelter you from a painful chastisement."
  46,32,"And whoever does not respond to God’s summoner cannot thwart God on earth that is to say he will not be able to thwart God by escaping from Him and eluding Him and he the one who does not respond will not have besides Him that is besides God any protectors any helpers to ward off the chastisement from him — those who do not respond are in manifest error’ plain and evident error."
  46,33,"Have they not seen have they not realised that is the deniers of resurrection that God Who created the heavens and the earth and Who was not wearied by their creation Who did not fail therein is able to give life to the dead? bi-qādirin is the predicate of anna ‘that’ the bi- having been added to it because the statement has the same force as the construction a-laysa’Llāhu bi-qādirin ‘Is God not able …?’. Yes indeed He is able to give life to the dead. Indeed He has is able to do all things."
  46,34,"And on the day when those who disbelieve are exposed to the Fire when they are being chastised in it it will be said to them ‘Is not this chastisement the truth?’ They will say ‘Yes by our Lord!’ He will say ‘Then taste the chastisement for what you used to disbelieve in’."
  46,35,"So endure with patience the harm done to you by your people just as the resolute those of constancy and power of endurance during hardships from among the messengers endured with patience before you so that you may be one of resolve like them min of mina’l-rusuli is explicative as all of them were men of resolve; but some say that this particle min is actually meant to be partitive since excluded from their number are Adam on the basis of God’s saying exalted be He And We did not find in him any constancy Q. 20115; and Jonah on the basis of His words And do not be like the One of the fish Q. 6848. And do not seek to hasten it for them for your people the sending down of the chastisement on them. Some say that he the Prophet seemed by this stage to have become exasperated because of them and desired that chastisement be sent down on them which is why he was enjoined to exercise patience and to refrain from hastening the chastisement for them — for it would befall them eventually without doubt. It shall seem for them on the day when they see what they are promised of chastisement in the Hereafter given its long duration as though they had tarried in this world by their reckoning only an hour of a day. This Qur’ān is a communication a proclamation from God to you. So shall any be destroyed that is to say none shall be destroyed upon seeing the chastisement but the immoral folk? that is to say the disbelieving folk."
