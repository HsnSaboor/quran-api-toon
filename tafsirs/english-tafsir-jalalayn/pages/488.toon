  42,45,"And you will see them being exposed to it namely the Fire submissive fearful and humbled by abasement looking at it with a furtive glance a slight look stealthily min of min tarfin khafiyyin ‘with a furtive glance’ is to indicate inceptiveness or it functions with the sense of a bā’ ‘with’ sc. bi-tarfin khafiyyin. And those who believe will say ‘Verily the true losers are those who have lost themselves and their families on the Day of Resurrection for being condemned to abide forever in the Fire and for not being able to attain the blissful company of the houris prepared for them in Paradise had they been believers the relative clause alladhīna khasirū... ‘those who have lost …’ constitutes the predicate of the particle inna ‘verily’. Truly the wrongdoers the disbelievers will be in lasting everlasting chastisement — these words constitute God’s speech exalted be He."
  42,46,"And they have no guardians to help them besides God that is to say other than Him to ward off His chastisement from them and whomever God leads astray has no course of action’ no route to the truth in this world or to Paradise in the Hereafter."
  42,47,"Answer your Lord respond to Him by affirming His Oneness and worshipping Him before there comes a day namely the Day of Resurrection for which there is no revoking from God in other words one which when He brings about He will not revoke. On that day you will have no refuge in which to seek refuge in and for you there will be no way of denying your sins."
  42,48,"But if they are disregardful of answering God We have not sent you as a keeper over them to keep track of their deeds by securing what is demanded of them. Your duty is only to deliver the Message — this was revealed before the command to struggle against them. And indeed when We let man taste from Us some mercy some grace such as wealth and good health he exults in it; but if some ill some calamity befalls them the pronoun here refers to ‘man’ on the basis of the plural import of the generic noun because of what their own hands have sent ahead because of what they have offered of deeds — the expression refers to ‘the hands’ because most actions are effected by them then lo! man is ungrateful for the grace."
  42,49,"To God belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. He creates whatever He will; He gives to whomever He will in the way of children females and He gives to whomever He will males."
  42,50,"Or He combines them that is to say or He makes them males and females; and He makes whomever He will infertile such that she is unable to conceive or he cannot have a child. Surely He is Knower of what He creates Powerful in bringing about whatever He will."
  42,51,"And it is not possible for any human that God should speak to him except that He should reveal to him by revelation in sleep or by inspiration or except from behind a veil where He makes the person able to hear His speech but without seeing Him — as was the case with Moses peace be upon him; or except that He should send a messenger an angel such as Gabriel and he the messenger then reveals to the person to whom he has been sent that is to say and then he speaks to him with His permission that is God’s whatever He God will. Truly He is Exalted above the attributes of created beings Wise in His actions."
