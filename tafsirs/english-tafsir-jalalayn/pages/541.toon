tafsir[5]{c,v,t}:
  57,25,"We have verily sent Our messengers the angels to prophets with clear signs with the definitive proofs and We revealed with them the Scripture and the Balance justice so that mankind may uphold justice. And We sent down iron We caused it to be extracted from mineral ores wherein is great might with which one may wage battle and many uses for mankind and so that God may know a knowledge of direct vision li-ya‘lama’Llāhu is a supplement to li-yaqūma’l-nāsu ‘so that mankind may uphold’ those who help Him by helping to uphold His religion through the use of instruments of war made of metal and otherwise and His messengers through the Unseen bi’l-ghaybi a circumstantial qualifier referring to the suffixed pronoun hā’ ‘Him’ of yansuruhu ‘who aid Him’ that is to say while He God is not seen by them in this world. Ibn ‘Abbās said ‘They help Him even though they do not see Him’ yansurūnahu wa-lā yubsirūnahu. Assuredly God is Strong Mighty without any need of being helped but such help benefits those who proffer it."
  57,26,"And verily We sent Noah and Abraham and We ordained among their seed prophethood and the Scripture meaning the four Books the Torah the Gospel the Psalms and the Furqān all of which have been revealed among the seed of Abraham; and some of them are rightly guided and many of them are immoral."
  57,27,"Then We sent to follow in their footsteps Our messengers and We sent to follow Jesus son of Mary and We gave him the Gospel and We placed in the hearts of those who followed him kindness and mercy. But as for monasticism namely abstention from women and seclusion in monasteries they invented it an innovation on their part — We had not prescribed it for them We did not enjoin them to it; but they took it on — only seeking God’s beatitude. Yet they did not observe it with due observance for many of them abandoned it and rejected the religion of Jesus and embraced the religion of their then king. However many of them did remain upon the religion of Jesus and they believed in our Prophet when he came. So We gave those of them who believed in him their reward; but many of them are immoral."
  57,28,"O you who believe in Jesus fear God and believe in His Messenger Muhammad (s) and Jesus and He will give you a twofold portion share of His mercy for your belief in both prophets; and He will assign for you a light by which you will walk across the Path over Hell and into Paradise and forgive you; for God is Forgiving Merciful;"
  57,29,"So that the People of the Scripture the Torah — those who did not believe in Muhammad (s) — may know in other words I inform you of this so that they the People of the Scripture may know that a of a-llā is softened in place of the hardened form an-lā its subject being the pronoun of the matter that is to say understand it as being annahum they have no power over anything of God’s bounty contrary to their claims that they are God’s beloved and those who deserve His beatitude and that all bounty is in God’s hand; He gives it to whomever He will and hence He has given the believers in the Prophet among them their reward twofold as stated above; and God is dispenser of tremendous bounty."
