  29,24,"God exalted be He says with regard to the tale of Abraham peace be upon him But the only answer of his people was that they said ‘Slay him or burn him!’ Then God delivered him from the fire into which they threw him by making it cool and harmless for him. Surely in that namely in that deliverance of him from it there are signs — namely the fact that it did not have any affect on him despite its greatness and the fact that it was extinguished and that within a brief period meadows sprung up in its place — for a people who believe a people who affirm the truth of God’s Oneness and His power for they are the ones to benefit from these signs."
  29,25,"And he Abraham said ‘You have adopted mere idols besides God which you worship mā of innamā relates to the verbal noun for the sake of mutual affection between you mawaddatu baynikum this is the predicate of inna of innamā; the accusative reading mawaddata baynikum would denote a direct object denoting reason so that the mā would denote ‘entirety’ — in other words you are friends of one another in your worship of them in the life of this world. Then on the Day of Resurrection you will disown one another the leaders will dissociate from those who followed them; and you will curse one another those who followed will curse their leaders; and your abode your destination all together will be the Fire and you will have no helpers’ to protect you against it."
  29,26,"And Lot believed in him he affirmed the sincerity of Abraham and he was his paternal nephew from his brother Hārān and he Abraham said ‘Indeed I am migrating away from my people toward my Lord to where my Lord commands. So he shunned his people and emigrated from the rural lands of Iraq to Syria. Indeed He is the Mighty in His kingdom the Wise’ in what He does."
  29,27,"And We gave him after Ishmael Isaac and Jacob after Isaac; and We ordained among his descendants prophethood thus all prophets after Abraham are descended from him and the Scripture meaning the Holy Books the Torah the Gospels the Psalms and the Criterion al-furqān. And We gave him his reward in this world which is fair praise of him by members of all the Abrahamic religions. And in the Hereafter he shall truly be among the righteous for whom there shall be the highest degrees of reward."
  29,28,"And mention Lot when he said to his people ‘Truly you read a-innakum pronouncing both hamzas or not pronouncing the second and inserting an alif between the two in either case and in both instances commit lewdness namely coming in unto the rears of men such as none in all the worlds of jinn or men has committed before you."
  29,29,"What! Do you come unto men and cut off the way the travel roads of passers-by committing lewd acts with whoever passes your way such that people ceased to pass by where you live and you discuss in your gatherings in your conversations indecency?’ you discuss committing lewd acts with one another. But the only answer of his people was that they said ‘Bring us the chastisement of God if you are truthful’ in your deeming such acts vile and that chastisement will befall those who do such things."
  29,30,"He said ‘My Lord help me by making that of which I spoke come true regarding the sending down of chastisement against the people who work corruption’ those who are disobedient by coming unto men. So God answered his call."
