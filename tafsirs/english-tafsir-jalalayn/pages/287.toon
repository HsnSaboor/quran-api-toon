  17,50,"Say to them ‘Be stones or iron"
  17,51,"or some creation yet greater in your breasts something yet far less able to accept life aside from bones and fragments a spirit will undoubtedly be made to exist in you to bring you back to life. They will then say ‘Who shall bring us back?’ to life. Say ‘He Who originated you created you the first time when you had not been anything in existence because the One Who is able to initiate creation is also able to repeat it indeed this repetition is easier than the initiation. Then they will shake their heads at you stupefied and they will say mockingly ‘When will it be?’ that is the Resurrection. Say ‘Maybe it is near!’"
  17,52,"The day He calls you the day He calls out to you from your graves by the tongue of the archangel Isrāfīl you will respond you will answer His call from your graves with His praise by His command — it is also said to mean that you will respond ‘and praise be to Him’ — and you will think that you have remained in this world only a little because of the terror of what you will see on that day."
  17,53,"And tell My servants the believers to speak to disbelievers that word which is finer. For Satan indeed incites ill feeling he makes trouble between them and Satan is indeed man’s manifest enemy his enmity is evident. The ‘finer word’ is to say this"
  17,54,"Your Lord knows you best. If He will He will have mercy on you by way of granting you repentance and faith or if He will for you to be chastised He will chastise you by having you die in disbelief. And We did not send you to be a guardian over them and so compel them to embrace faith — this was revealed before the command to fight them."
  17,55,"And your Lord knows best all who are in the heavens and the earth thus endowing them each one with what He will according to the measure of their states. And verily We have preferred some of the prophets above others endowing each of them with a particular merit Moses with being spoken to; Abraham with Friendship; and Muhammad (s) with the Night Journey; and We gave David the Psalms."
  17,56,"Say to them ‘Call on those whom you assumed to be gods besides Him such as the angels Jesus and Ezra ‘Uzayr; yet they have no power to rid you of misfortune nor to transfer it to persons other than you."
  17,57,"Those whom they call gods they themselves seek a means to their Lord they seek nearness by way of obedience which of them ayyuhum substitutes for the third person indicator wāw of the verb yabtaghūna ‘they seek’ in other words even he seeks it this nearness the one who is nearer to Him so how much more is it sought in the case of others?; and they hope for His mercy and fear His chastisement just like others so how can you call them gods? Truly your Lord’s chastisement is a thing to beware of."
  17,58,"There is not a town — its inhabitants are the ones meant — but We shall destroy it before the Day of Resurrection through death or chastise it with terrible chastisement by killing its inhabitants or otherwise. That has been inscribed in the Book the Preserved Tablet al-lawh al-mahfūz."
