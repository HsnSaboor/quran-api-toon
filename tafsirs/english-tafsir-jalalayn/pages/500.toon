tafsir[9]{c,v,t}:
  45,14,"Tell those who believe to forgive those who do not anticipate those who do not fear the days of God the events which He precipitates that is to say forgive the disbelievers the harm which they have caused you — this was before the command to struggle against them had been revealed — that He God may requite a variant reading for li-yajziya has li-najziya ‘that We may requite’ a people for what they used to earn when they used to forgive disbelievers the harm which they did."
  45,15,"Whoever acts righteously it is for the benefit of his own soul that he acts so and whoever does evil it is to the detriment thereof that he has done evil; then to your Lord you will be returned with your Lord you shall end up whereupon He will requite the one of righteous deeds and the evildoer."
  45,16,"And verily We gave the Children of Israel the Scripture the Torah and the means of judgement therewith between people and prophethood for Moses and Aaron among them and We provided them with the good things the lawful things such as manna and quails and We favoured them above all worlds the worlds of their time that is above all other rational beings."
  45,17,"And We gave them clear illustrations of the commandment the commandment of religion in the way of what is lawful or unlawful and the Mission of Muhammad (s) upon whom be the most excellent blessings and peace. And they did not differ regarding his Mission except after the knowledge had come to them out of rivalry among themselves that is to say because of some rivalry that came about among them out of envy of him. Surely your Lord will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning that in which they used to differ."
  45,18,"Then We set you O Muhammad (s) upon a clear course a clear way of the commandment the commandment of religion; so follow it and do not follow the desires of those who do not know in worshipping other than God."
  45,19,"Assuredly they will not avail they will not protect you in any way against God against His chastisement. And assuredly the wrongdoers the disbelievers are allies of one another; but God is the ally only of the God-fearing."
  45,20,"This Qur’ān is a set of insights for mankind guideposts with which they can discern God’s rulings and legal proscriptions and guidance and mercy for a people who have certainty with regard to the truth of the Resurrection."
  45,21,"Or am has the significance of the rhetorical hamza of denial do those who have perpetrated evil acts such as disbelief and disobedience suppose that We shall treat them as those who believe and perform righteous deeds equally sawā’an is the predicate in their life and in their death? mahyāhum wa-mamātuhum this clause constitutes the subject and a supplement; the sentence itself is a substitution for the kāf of ka’lladhīna ‘as those’ and both suffixed pronouns -hum refer to the disbelievers. The meaning is do they suppose that in the Hereafter We will assign them a good fate like believers that they will enjoy a life of plenty one equal to their life in this world as when they said to the believers ‘Surely if we were to be resurrected we will be given the same good things that you will be given!’ God exalted be He says in accordance with His denial implicit in the rhetorical interrogative hamza How evil is that judgement which they make! In other words it will not be so for in the Hereafter they will be suffering in the chastisement in contrast to their lives in this world; the believers on the other hand will be delighting in the Reward in the Hereafter because of their righteous deeds in this world such as their observance of prayers their alms-giving fasting and otherwise the mā ‘that … which’ relates to the verbal action that is to say ba’isa hukman hukmuhum hādhā ‘awful as a judgement is this judgement of theirs’."
  45,22,"And God created the heavens and He created the earth with the truth bi’l-haqqi is semantically connected to khalaqa ‘He created’ so that He may indicate His power and His Oneness and so that every soul may be requited for what it has earned in the way of acts of disobedience or obedience and therefore the disbeliever cannot be equal to the believer and they will not be wronged."
