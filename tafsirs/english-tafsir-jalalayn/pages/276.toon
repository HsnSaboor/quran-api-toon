  16,80,"And it is God Who has made for you your homes as a place of rest a place that you can inhabit and He has made for you out of the skins of the cattle homes such as tents and pavilions which you find light to carry on the day of your migration your travel and on the day of your halting; and of their wool that is the sheep’s and their fur that is the camels’ and their hair that is the goats’ He has made for you furniture chattels such as rugs and blankets and wares for you to use for a while until they perish."
  16,81,"And it is God Who has made for you from what He created of houses trees and clouds shade zilāl is the plural of zill to protect you from the heat of the sun; and He has made for you in the mountains places of refuge aknān is the plural of kinn which is a places where one can seek shelter istakanna such as a cave or a tunnel; and He has made for you garments shirts that protect you from the heat that is and also from the cold and garments that protect you from your mutual violence your warring in other words to protect you from stabbed or struck during these instances garments such as coats of mail and armour plates.

  16,85,"And when those who did wrong those who disbelieved behold the chastisement the Fire it shall not be lightened for them the chastisement nor will they be granted any respite any deferment from it when they see it."
  16,86,"And when the idolaters behold their associates of devils and others they will say ‘Our Lord these are our associates whom we used to invoke whom we used to worship besides You’.
