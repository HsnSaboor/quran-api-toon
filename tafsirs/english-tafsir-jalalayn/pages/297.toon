tafsir[7]{c,v,t}:
  18,28,"And restrain yourself detain yourself along with those who call upon their Lord at morning and evening desiring through their worship His Countenance exalted be He and not any of the transient things of this world — and these are the poor; and do not let your eyes overlook turn away from them — these the eyes are being used to refer to the person addressed — desiring the glitter of the life of this world. And do not obey him whose heart We have made oblivious to Our remembrance that is to the Qur’ān — this was ‘Uyayna b. Hisn and his companions — and who follows his own whim by attributing partners to God and whose conduct is mere prodigality excess."
  18,29,"And say to him and to his companions that this Qur’ān is ‘The truth that comes from your Lord; so whoever will let him believe and whoever will let him disbelieve’ — this is meant as a threat to them. Indeed We have prepared for the wrongdoers that is the disbelievers a Fire and they will be surrounded by its pavilion by that which encloses the Fire itself. If they cry out for help they will be succoured with water like molten copper like thick burning oil which scalds faces because of the intensity of its heat if it is brought near them. What an evil drink that is and how ill is the Fire as a resting-place! murtafaqan is a specification derived from the agent of the verb in other words vile is the person choosing to rest thereon; and this is in contrast to what He will say next about Paradise How fair a resting-place below verse 31. For indeed what resting-place can there be in the Fire?"
  18,30,"Truly those who believe and perform righteous deeds — indeed We do not leave the reward of those of good deeds to go to waste this last sentence is the predicate of the previous inna’lladhīna ‘truly those who’ and in it an overt identification of the recipients of the reward has replaced the would-be pronominalisation in other words it is ‘their reward’ which shall not be left to go to waste and We will reward them with what it the reward of good-doers comprises."
  18,31,"Those for them there shall be Gardens of Eden as a place of residence underneath which rivers flow; therein they shall be adorned with bracelets of gold min asāwir it is said that min here is either extra or partitive; it asāwir is the plural of aswira — similar in pattern to ahmira for himār — which is the plural of siwār and they shall wear green garments of fine silk sundus and heavy silk brocade istabraq is that silk which is coarse God says in the verse of sūrat al-Rahmān Q. 5554 lined with heavy silk brocade; reclining therein on couches arā’ik is the plural of arīka which is a bed inside a curtained canopy and is also a tent adorned with garments and curtains for a bride. How excellent a reward a requital is Paradise and how fair a resting-place!"
  18,32,"And strike coin for them for the disbelievers together with the believers a similitude two men rajulayn is a substitute for mathalan ‘a similitude’ and constitutes together with what follows an explanation of the similitude to one of whom the disbeliever We had assigned two gardens orchards of vines and We had surrounded them with date-palms and had set between them a field of crops from which he acquired his food supplies."
  18,33,"Each of the two gardens kiltā ‘each of the two’ is a singular noun that indicates a dual number; and the entire clause is the subject yielded ātat is the predicate thereof its produce its fruit without stinting diminishing anything thereof. And We caused a stream to gush forth therein to run through them."
  18,34,"And he had together with his two gardens fruit read thamar thumur or thumr all of which constitute the plural of thamra sing. ‘a fruit’ similar in pattern to shajara pl. shajar khashaba pl. khushb or badana pl. budn and he said to his companion the believer as he conversed with him boasting before him ‘I have more wealth than you and am stronger in respect of men’ in respect of clansmen."
