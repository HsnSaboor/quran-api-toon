  17,97,"And he whom God guides is rightly guided and he whom He sends astray — you will not find for them any guardians to guide them besides Him. And We shall assemble them on the Day of Resurrection walking on their faces blind dumb and deaf; their abode shall be Hell — whenever it abates whenever its flames subside We shall intensify for them the blaze the flame and its burning."
  17,98,"That is their requital because they disbelieved Our signs and said in denial of the Resurrection ‘What when we are bones and fragments shall we really be raised in a new creation?’"
  17,99,"Have they not seen realised that God He Who created the heavens and the earth with all their immensity has the power to create the like of them? that is the like of these human beings especially given their smallness? He has appointed for them a term until the time for their death and resurrection whereof is no doubt; yet the wrongdoers insist on disbelief on denial of such a term."
  17,100,"Say to them ‘If you possessed the treasuries of my Lord’s mercy those treasuries of provision and rain you would surely withhold them you would stint for fear of spending fearing that they would be depleted if one spent from them and that you would then become impoverished; and man is ever niggardly’."
  17,101,"And verily We gave Moses nine manifest signs clear signs namely those of the hand the staff the flood the locusts the lice the frogs the blood and the obliteration of their possessions cf. Q. 1088 the years of dearth and scarcity of fruits cf. Q. 7130. Ask O Muhammad (s) the Children of Israel about this a rhetorical question meant as an affirmation for the idolaters of your sincerity; or it means that We said to him Muhammad (s) ‘Ask’; a variant reading has the past tense fa-sā’ala ‘and he asked’ when he came to them Pharaoh said to him ‘O Moses I truly think that you are bewitched’ duped your mind deceived."
  17,102,"He Moses said ‘Indeed you know that none revealed these signs except the Lord of the heavens and the earth as proofs lessons; however you are being stubborn a variant reading for ‘alimta ‘you know’ has ‘alimtu ‘I know’; and I truly think that you O Pharaoh are doomed’ that you will be destroyed — or it mathbūran means that Pharaoh has been turned away from all deeds that are good."
  17,103,"And he Pharaoh desired to scare them to expel Moses and his people from the land the land of Egypt; so We drowned him and those with him all together."
  17,104,"And after him We said to the Children of Israel ‘Dwell in the land; but when the promise of the Hereafter namely the Hour comes to pass We shall bring you gathered in mixed company’ all together you and them."
