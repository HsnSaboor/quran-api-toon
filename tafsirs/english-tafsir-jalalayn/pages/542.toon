tafsir[6]{c,v,t}:
  58,1,"God has certainly heard the words of her who disputes with you her who consults you O Prophet concerning her husband who has repudiated her by zihār — he had said to her ‘You are to me as untouchable as the back of my mother’. She asked the Prophet s about this and he told her that she was thenceforth forbidden to him as was customary among them at the time of Jāhiliyya namely that repudiation by zihār results in permanent separation. She was Khawla bt. Tha‘laba and he was Aws b. al-Sāmit — and complains to God of her being alone and of her impoverishment while having young children whom if she were to leave with him they would go astray but whom if they remained with her would go hungry. And God hears your conversation your consulting. Assuredly God is Hearer Seer He is Knower."
  58,2,"Those of you who repudiate their wives by zihār yazzahharūna is actually yatazahharūna in which the tā’ has been assimilated with the zā’; a variant reading has yazzāharūna and still another has yuzāhirūna similar in form to yuqātilūna; the same applies for the second instance of this verb below they are not their mothers; their mothers are only those who read allā’ī or without the final long yā’ allā’i gave birth to them and indeed they in repudiating them by zihār utter indecent words and a calumny a lie. Yet assuredly God is Pardoning Forgiving to the one who repudiates by zihār through an atonement which he must offer."
  58,3,"And those who repudiate their wives by zihār and then go back on what they have said instead doing the opposite of this and retaining the woman divorced by zihār that which is contrary to the purpose of zihār in which a woman is characterised as being forbidden — then the penalty for them is the setting free of a slave an obligation upon him before they touch one another in sexual intercourse. By this you are being admonished; and God is Aware of what you do."
  58,4,"And he who cannot find the wherewithal to set free a slave then his redemption shall be the fasting of two successive months before they touch one another. And if he is unable to fast then the redemption shall be the feeding of sixty needy persons as an obligation upon him that is before they touch one another understanding the unrestricted prescription as having the same restriction as the restricted one. For every needy person he should give one mudd measure of the principal food of the town. This namely lightening of the atonement is so that you may believe in God and His Messenger. And these namely the rulings mentioned are God’s bounds; and for the rejecters of them there is a painful chastisement."
  58,5,"Indeed those who oppose God and His Messenger will be abased humiliated just as those before them were abased for opposing their messengers. And verily We have revealed clear signs indicating the truthfulness of the Messenger and for those who disbelieve in the signs there is a humiliating chastisement."
  58,6,"The day when God will raise them all together He will then inform them of what they did. God has kept count of it while they forgot it. And God is Witness to all things."
