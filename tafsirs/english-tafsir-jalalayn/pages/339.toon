He will judge between them between believers and disbelievers in the way that He explains next Then those who believed and performed righteous deeds will be in Gardens of Bliss as a bounty from God"

  22,58,"And those who emigrated in the way of God that is in obedience to Him from emigrating from Mecca to Medina and then were slain or died God shall provide them with a good provision namely the provision of Paradise. Truly God is the best of providers the most excellent of givers."
  22,59,"Assuredly He will admit them into a place read mudkhalan or madkhalan respectively signifying the means of entry or the place entered that is pleasing to them and that is Paradise. And truly God is Knowing of their intentions Forbearing in refraining from punishing them."
  22,60,"That which We have related to you is so. And whoever retaliates whoever from among the believers requites with the like of what he was made to suffer at the hands of the idolaters wrongfully that is whoever fights against them if they fight against him during the sacred month and then is again made to suffer aggression by them that is to say he is again wronged by being expelled from his house God will surely help him.
