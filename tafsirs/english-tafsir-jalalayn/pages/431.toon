tafsir[9]{c,v,t}:
  34,23,"And intercession will not avail with Him exalted be He — this was in response to their saying that their gods would intercede for them with Him — except for him to whom leave is given in this respect read adhina ‘to whom He gives leave’; or udhina ‘to whom leave is given’. Yet when fear is banished from their hearts read active fazza‘a or passive fuzzi‘a when fear is removed from them upon leave being given for this intercession they will say — some will say to others in anticipation of a favourable outcome — ‘What has your Lord said?’ concerning this. They will say He has said the saying that is ‘The truth’ in other words leave has been given for it. And He is the Exalted above His creation by His subjugation of them the Great the Tremendous."
  34,24,"Say ‘Who provides for you from the heavens rain and from the earth?’ vegetation. Say ‘God!’ — even if they do not say it there is no other valid answer. And indeed either we or you are — in other words either one of the two parties is — rightly guided or in manifest error. The ambiguity here concerning which of the two is rightly guided is intended as a gentle invitation for them to embrace faith if their way to it is facilitated by God."
  34,25,"Say ‘You will not be questioned about the sins we committed nor shall we be questioned about what you do’ for we are quit of you."
  34,26,"Say ‘Our Lord will bring us together on the Day of Resurrection then He will judge between us with truth and He will admit the truthful into Paradise and the liars into the Fire. And He is the Judge the Knowing’ in what He judges."
  34,27,"Say ‘Show me apprise me of those whom you have joined to Him as associates in worship. No indeed! — this is meant to deter them from even supposing that He has an associate. Rather He is God the Mighty Whose way will prevail the Wise’ in the way in which He manages the affairs of His creation and so He could not have any associate in His kingdom."
  34,28,"And We did not send you except to all kāffatan is a circumstantial qualifier referring to al-nās ‘mankind’ and is made to precede li’l-nās because of the importance attached to it of mankind both as a bearer of good tidings to believers of Paradise and a warner to the disbelievers of chastisement but most people such as the disbelievers of Mecca do not know this."
  34,29,"And they say ‘When shall this promise of chastisement be fulfilled if you are being truthful?’ concerning it."
  34,30,"Say ‘Yours is the tryst of a Day which you can neither defer nor advance by a single hour’ and this is the Day of Resurrection."
  34,31,"And those who disbelieve from among the people of Mecca say ‘We will not believe in this Qur’ān nor in that which was revealed before it’ — in other words what preceded it such as the Torah and the Gospel both of which contain proofs of the Resurrection — because they reject the truth of this last. God exalted be He says of them But if you were to see O Muhammad (s) when the evildoers the disbelievers are brought to stand before their Lord bandying arguments against one another. Those who were oppressed — the followers — will say to those who were arrogant — the leaders ‘Had it not been for you barring us from faith we would have been believers’ in the Prophet."
