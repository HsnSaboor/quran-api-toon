tafsir[10]{c,v,t}:
  20,126,"He will say ‘So it the affair is. Our signs came to you but you forgot them you neglected them and did not believe in them; and so just as you forgot Our signs today you will be forgotten’ abandoned in the Fire."
  20,127,"And so just as We requite him who disregards the Qur’ān We requite him who is prodigal him who associates others with God and believes not in the signs of his Lord. And the chastisement of the Hereafter is more terrible than the chastisement of the life of this world and the punishment of the grave and more enduring longer lasting."
  20,128,"Is it not a guidance has it not become clear to them to the disbelievers of Mecca how many kam is predicative and the object of the following ahlaknā We destroyed in other words Our frequent destruction before them of generations that is of past communities for denying messengers amid the ruins of whose dwelling-places they walk? yamshūna is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the person of the pronoun lahum ‘to them’ during their journeys to Syria and other places that they might thus be admonished? what has been mentioned by grammarians regarding the derivation of the verb ihlāk to be that verb that does not contain a particle referring to the object of the action of the verb as a way of preserving the original sense of the statement is acceptable. Surely in that there are signs lessons for people of sense for possessors of intellect."
  20,129,"And but for a decree that had already preceded from your Lord that their chastisement be deferred to the Hereafter it destruction would have been an inevitability their destruction would have been necessary in this world and a specified term fixed for them ajalun musamman a supplement to the pronoun concealed in kāna ‘it would have been’ the separation of both subjects by the predicate of both serves as an emphasis."
  20,130,"So be patient with what they say — this is abrogated by the ‘fighting’ verse cf. Q. 2190ff — and make glorifications pray by praising your Lord bi-hamdi rabbika is a circumstantial qualifier in other words ‘ensconced in such praise’ before the rising of the sun the morning prayer and before its setting — the afternoon prayer — and in the watches of the night during the hours thereof and make glorifications perform the sunset and the evening prayer and at either side of the day wa-atrāfa’l-nahāri a supplement to the syntactical locus of the accusative clause wa-min ānā’i ‘and in the watches’ in other words perform the noon prayer because the time for it begins at the point where the sun starts to go down which is the end side of the first half of the day and the start side of the second half of the day; that perhaps you may be pleased with the reward that you will be given."
  20,131,"And do not extend your glance toward what We have given to some pairs certain categories among them to enjoy as the flower of the life of this world its adornment and delight that We may try them thereby to see if they transgress the bounds. And your Lord’s provision in Paradise is better than what they have been given in this world and more enduring longer lasting."
  20,132,"And bid your family to prayer and be steadfast in the maintenance of it. We do not ask of you We do not charge you with the procurement of any provision either for yourself or for anyone else. We it is Who provide you and the best sequel Paradise will be in favour of God-fearing for such people."
  20,133,"And they the idolaters say ‘Why does he Muhammad (s) not bring us a sign from his Lord?’ of the sort which they request. Has there not come to them read ta’tihim or ya’tihim the clear proof the statements of what is in the former scriptures? the tales contained in the Qur’ān relating to past communities and the details of their destruction for denying the messengers?"
  20,134,"Had We destroyed them with a chastisement before him before the coming of Muhammad (s) the Messenger they would have said on the Day of Resurrection ‘Our Lord if only You had sent us a messenger so that we might have followed those signs of Yours given to the messengers to convey before we were thus abased at the Resurrection and disgraced?’ in Hell."
  20,135,"Say to them ‘Each one of us and you is waiting to see what this affair will lead to. So wait! For you shall indeed know at the Resurrection who are the followers of the even path the straight way and who is rightly guided’ away from error us or you."
