tafsir[6]{c,v,t}:
  9,1,"This is A declaration of immunity from God and His Messenger to reach the idolaters with whom you made a pact a pact for an indefinite period of time or one for a period of less than or more than four months; the annulment of the pact shall be as God mentions in His saying"
  9,2,"‘Journey freely travel in security O idolaters in the land for four months — beginning with the month of Shawwāl on the basis of what will come shortly — after which there will be no security for you and know that you cannot escape God that is you shall not elude His punishment and that God degrades the disbelievers’ humiliating them in this world by having them killed and in the Hereafter by sending them to the Fire."
  9,3,"A proclamation a notification from God and His Messenger to mankind on the day of the Greater Pilgrimage the Day of Sacrifice yawm al-nahr that God is free from obligation to the idolaters and their pacts and so is His Messenger also free from obligation in that same year year 9 of the Hijra the Prophet s sent forth ‘Alī who proclaimed these verses on the Day of Sacrifice at Minā and also he proclaimed that after this year no idolater will be allowed to make pilgrimage or circumambulate the House naked as reported by al-Bukhārī. So if you repent of unbelief it will be better for you; but if you turn away from belief then know that you cannot escape God. And give tidings to — inform — those who disbelieve of a painful chastisement namely of slaughter or capture in this world and of punishment in the Fire in the Hereafter."
  9,4,"Excepting those of the idolaters with whom you have made a pact and who have not diminished their commitment to you in anyway with regard to the terms of the pact nor supported assisted anyone from among the disbelievers against you; as for these fulfil your pact with them until the completion of the term to which you have agreed. Truly God loves those who fear Him by fulfilling pacts."
  9,5,"Then when the sacred months have passed — that is at the end of the period of deferment — slay the idolaters wherever you find them be it during a lawful period or a sacred one and take them captive and confine them to castles and forts until they have no choice except being put to death or acceptance of Islam; and lie in wait for them at every place of ambush at every route that they use kulla ‘every’ is in the accusative because a preceding genitive-taking preposition has been removed. But if they repent of unbelief and establish prayer and pay the alms then leave their way free and do not interfere with them. God is Forgiving Merciful to those who repent."
  9,6,"And if any one of the idolaters ahadun ‘one’ is in the nominative because of the following verb istajāraka ‘seeks your protection’ that validates it seeks your protection requests security from you against being killed then grant him protection provide security for him so that he might hear the words of God — the Qur’ān — and afterward convey him to his place of security that is the dwelling-places of his folk if he does not believe so that he might reflect upon his situation — that which is mentioned is because they are a people who do not know the religion of God and so they must be made to hear the Qur’ān in order to come to know religion."
