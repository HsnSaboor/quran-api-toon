tafsir[9]{c,v,t}:
  22,47,"And they ask you to hasten the chastisement even though God would never break His promise of sending down the chastisement upon them — and so He sent it down on the day of Badr. And truly a day with your Lord of the days of the Hereafter on account of the severity of the chastisement is like a thousand years of your counting read ta‘uddūna or ya‘uddūna ‘their counting’ in this world."
  22,48,"To how many a town did I give respite while it was doing wrong; but then I seized it meaning I seized its inhabitants and with Me lies the journey’s end the final return."
  22,49,"Say ‘O mankind that is O people of Mecca I am only a manifest warner to you’ one whose warning is plain; but also I am a giver of good tidings to the believers."
  22,50,"And so those who believe and perform righteous deeds — for them there shall be forgiveness of their sins and a glorious provision namely Paradise."
  22,51,"But those who strive against Our signs namely the Qur’ān in order to invalidate them seeking to incapacitate mu‘ajjizīna those who follow the Prophet this meaning of mu‘ajjizīna being derived from their assumption that these followers are incapable individuals and impeding them from practising their faith; or mu‘ajjizīna means supposing Us to be incapable against them a variant reading of mu‘ajjizīna has mu‘ājizīna meaning ‘contending with Us’ that is to say they suppose that they will be able to elude Us by denying resurrection and requital — those they shall be the inhabitants of hell-fire."
  22,52,"And We did not send before you any messenger rasūl — this is a prophet who has been commanded to deliver a Message — or prophet nabī — one who has not been commanded to deliver anything — but that when he recited the scripture Satan cast into his recitation what is not from the Qur’ān but which those to whom he the prophet had been sent would find pleasing. The Prophet s had during an assembly of the men of Quraysh after reciting the following verses from sūrat al-Najm Have you considered Lāt and ‘Uzzā? And Manāt the third one? 5319-20 added as a result of Satan casting them onto his tongue without his the Prophet’s being aware of it the following words ‘those are the high-flying cranes al-gharānīq al-‘ulā and indeed their intercession is to be hoped for’ and so they the men of Quraysh were thereby delighted. Gabriel however later informed him the Prophet of this that Satan had cast onto his tongue and he was grieved by it; but was subsequently comforted with this following verse that he might be reassured of God’s pleasure thereat God abrogates nullifies whatever Satan had cast then God confirms His revelations. And God is Knower of Satan’s casting of that which has been mentioned Wise in His enabling him Satan to do such things for He does whatever He will."
  22,53,"That He may make what Satan has cast a trial a test for those in whose hearts is a sickness dissension and hypocrisy and those whose hearts are hardened namely the idolaters hardened against acceptance of the truth. For truly the evildoers the disbelievers are steeped in extreme defiance in a protracted feud with the Prophet s and the believers for his tongue uttered mention of their gods in a way that pleased them and yet this was later nullified."
  22,54,"And that those who have been given knowledge of God’s Oneness and the Qur’ān may know that it the Qur’ān is the truth from your Lord so that they may believe therein and their hearts may find reassurance in it. And assuredly God guides those who believe to a straight path a straight route namely the religion of Islam."
  22,55,"And those who disbelieve will not cease to be in doubt of it that is the Qur’ān — because of what Satan had cast onto the tongue of the Prophet s and what had thereafter been nullified — until the Hour comes upon them unawares that is the Hour of their death or of resurrection comes upon them suddenly or there come upon them the chastisement of a day of desolation ‘aqīm namely the day of Badr which held nothing of good for disbelievers much like a sterile wind rīh ‘aqīm that bears no good; or it means the Day of Resurrection referred to as ‘desolate’ because thereafter there will be no more night."
