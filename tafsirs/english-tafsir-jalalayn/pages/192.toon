tafsir[5]{c,v,t}:
  9,32,"They desire to extinguish God’s light His Law and His proofs with their tongues with what they say about Him; and God refuses but to perfect to make manifest His light even though the disbelievers be averse to this."
  9,33,"He it is Who has sent His Messenger Muhammad (s) with the guidance and the religion of truth that He may manifest it make it prevail over every religion all the religions which oppose it even though the disbelievers be averse to this."
  9,34,"O you who believe many of the rabbis and monks indeed consume take people’s goods by false means as in the case of bribes paid for judgements and bar people from the way of God from His religion. And those who wa’lladhīna is the subject hoard up gold and silver and do not expend them these treasure-hoards in the way of God that is they do not pay from it what is due to Him by way of alms and charity — give them tidings inform them of a painful chastisement."
  9,35,"On the day when it shall be heated in the fire of Hell and therewith their foreheads and their sides and their backs shall be branded burnt — their skins will be stretched until these hoards of gold and silver can be placed on them entirely and it will be said to them ‘This is what you hoarded up for yourselves so taste now what you used to hoard!’ that is taste its requital."
  9,36,"Verily the number of months used to reckon the year with God is twelve months in the Book of God the Preserved Tablet al-lawh al-mahfūz from the day that He created the heavens and the earth; four of them that is the months are sacred inviolable Dhū’l-Qa‘da Dhū’l-Hijja Muharram and Rajab. That making of them sacred is the right the upright religion. So do not wrong yourselves during them during these sacred months with acts of disobedience for their burden of sin is greater therein; but it is also said to mean do not wrong yourselves at any time during all the months of the year. And fight the idolaters altogether all of them throughout the months even as they fight you altogether; and know that God is with those who fear Him supporting and assisting them."
