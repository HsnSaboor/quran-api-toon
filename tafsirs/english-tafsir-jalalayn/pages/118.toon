tafsir[7]{c,v,t}:
  5,58,"And those who when you make the call to prayer take it that is the prayer in mockery and as a game mocking it and laughing at it among themselves; that mocking attitude is because they are a people who do not understand."
  5,59,"The following was revealed when the Jews said to the Prophet s ‘Whom among the messengers do you believe in?’ and he replied in God and in that which has been revealed to us Q. 2136 and when he mentioned Jesus they said ‘We know of no religion worse than yours!’ Say ‘O People of the Scripture do you spite do you repudiate us for any other cause than that we believe in God and what has been revealed to us and what was revealed to the prophets before and that most of you are wicked?’ wa-anna aktharakum fāsiqūn is a supplement to an āmannā ‘that we believe’ that is to say ‘What you repudiate in fact is our faith and your opposition to it in refusing to accept it — a refusal which is described as ‘wickedness’ this wickedness itself being the necessary consequence of such a refusal — but in fact this faith of ours is not something to be repudiated’."
  5,60,"Say ‘Shall I tell you shall I inform you of what is worse than the followers of that about which you are spiteful by way of reward requital from God? They are those whom God has cursed whom He has removed from His mercy and with whom He is wroth and some of whom He has turned into apes and swine by transformation and those who worship the false deity Satan by obeying him the particle minhum ‘some of whom’ takes into account the potentially plural import of the particle min ‘those whom’ and in what precedes minhum ‘some of whom’ the singular form of min is taken into account; a variant reading has ‘abuda al-tāghūt as the genitive of an annexation ‘abud being a variant plural of ‘abd; the accusative ending of ‘abuda is because the clause is a supplement to al-qirada ‘apes’ and these were the Jews. They are worse situated makānan is for specification for their abode shall be the Fire and further astray from the even way’ from the path of truth al-sawā’ originally means al-wasat ‘middle’; the use of sharrun ‘worse’ and adallu ‘further astray’ is intended to counter their saying ‘We know of no religion worse sharrun than yours’."
  5,61,"When they the hypocrites from among the Jews come to you they say ‘We believe’; but they have entered unto you ensconced in disbelief and so they have departed from you ensconced in it and they have not believed. And God knows very well what they were hiding of hypocrisy."
  5,62,"And you see many of them namely the Jews vying falling headlong in sin in calumny and enmity wrongdoing and their consuming of unlawful gain what is illicit like bribes; evil is that deed of theirs which they have been committing."
  5,63,"Why do the rabbis and the priests among them not forbid them from uttering sin calumny and consuming unlawful gain? Evil is what they have been doing in refraining from forbidding them."
  5,64,"The Jews said when their circumstances became straitened on account of their denial of the Prophet s after having been the wealthiest of people ‘God’s hand is fettered’ withholding the sending forth of provision upon us — this was their metaphor for niggardliness — may God be exalted above this. God exalted be He says Fettered be withheld be their hands from the performance of good deeds as an invocation against them; and they are cursed for what they have said. Nay but His hands are extended out wide — a hyperbole for the attribute of generosity — the use of yadā the dual for yad ‘hand’ is intended to imply abundance since the utmost that an affluent person can give freely of his wealth is when he gives it with both hands. He expends how He will in giving abundantly or straitening and there can be no objection to this. And what has been revealed to you from your Lord of the Qur’ān will surely increase many of them in insolence and disbelief because of their very disbelief in it; and We have cast between them enmity and hatred until the Day of Resurrection and so every sect among them is opposed to the other. Every time they light the fires of war that is for war against the Prophet s God extinguishes them that is every time they desire it war He repels them. And they hasten about the earth in corruption that is they hasten about corrupting through acts of disobedience and God does not love corrupters meaning that He will punish them."
