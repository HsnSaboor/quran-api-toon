tafsir[5]{c,v,t}:
  9,107,"And among them those who have chosen a mosque — these were twelve men from among the hypocrites — by way of harm to cause distress for those of the mosque of Qubā’ and disbelief since they built it on the orders of the monk Abū ‘Āmir as a sanctuary for him so that whoever comes from his side may stay there he had gone to the Byzantine Emperor qaysar to bring troops to fight against the Prophet s and to cause division among the believers who pray in the mosque of Qubā’ by having some of these pray in their the hypocrites’ mosque and as an outpost an observation post for those who waged war against God and His Messenger before that is before it was built — meaning the above-mentioned Abū ‘Āmir — they will swear ‘We desired nothing by building it but to do good’ by way of kindness towards the poor in times of heavy rain or extreme heat and in order to provide a place of worship for the Muslims; and God bears witness that they are truly liars in this claim of theirs. They had asked the Prophet s to perform prayers in it and so the following was revealed"
  9,108,"Never stand never perform prayer there and so he sent a group of men to destroy and burn it and in its place they left a refuse pit where decaying cadavers would be dumped. A mosque which was founded one whose foundations were built upon piety from the first day constructed the day you arrived in Medina dār al-hijra — this was the mosque of Qubā’ as mentioned in Bukhārī — is worthier than that other one for you to stand to perform prayer therein; in it are men namely the Ansār who love to purify themselves; and God loves those who purify themselves muttahhirīn the original tā’ of mutatahhirūn has been assimilated with the tā’ that is He will reward them. Ibn Khuzayma reported in his Sahīh by way of an isnād from ‘Uwaym b. Sā‘ida that ‘The Prophet s came to them at the mosque of Qubā’ and said “God exalted be He has praised handsomely the way you purify yourselves in the story about your mosque so what is this purification which you perform?” They said “By God O Messenger of God all that we know is that we used to have Jews in our vicinity and they used to wash their behinds after defecation and so we began to wash in the way they did”’. According to one hadīth reported by al-Bazzār they said ‘We use stones to scrape off remnants and follow this with water’; to which he the Prophet said ‘That is the way for proper purification. Let this be your way’."
  9,109,"Is he who founded his building upon fear of God and in hope of beatitude from Him better or he who founded his building upon the brink the edge of a bank an overhang that is crumbling about to collapse read juruf or jurf so that it toppled with him so that it collapsed taking with it the one who built it into the fire of Hell? this is an excellent similitude for building upon that which constitutes the opposite of fear of God and for what it leads to; the interrogative is meant as an affirmative in other words the former is the better which is the likeness of the building of the mosque of Qubā’ while the latter is the likeness of the mosque of ‘harm’ masjid al-dirār. And God guides not the evildoing folk."
  9,110,"The buildings which they have built will never cease to be a misgiving a point of doubt in their hearts unless their hearts are cut torn to pieces such that they die; and God is Knower of His creatures Wise in what He does with them."
  9,111,"Indeed God has purchased from the believers their lives and their possessions that they expend it in obedience of Him — for example by striving in His way — so that theirs will be the reward of Paradise they shall fight in the way of God and they shall kill and be killed this sentence is independent and constitutes an explication of the above-mentioned ‘purchase’; a variant reading has the passive verb come first sc. fa-yuqtalūna wa-yaqtulūn ‘they shall be killed and shall kill’ meaning that some of them are killed while those who remain fight on; that is a promise which is binding both wa‘dan ‘promise’ and haqqan ‘binding’ are verbal nouns and are in the accusative on account of their omitted implicit verbs upon Him in the Torah and the Gospel and the Qur’ān; and who fulfils his covenant better than God? that is no one is better in fulfilling it. Rejoice then there is a shift from the third to second person here in this bargain of yours which you have made for that bargain is the supreme triumph the one that secures the ultimate goal."
