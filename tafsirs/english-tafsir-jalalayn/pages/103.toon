tafsir[8]{c,v,t}:
  4,155,"So for their breaking fa-bi-mā naqdihim the mā is extra; the bā’ is causative and connected to a missing element such as sabab ‘reason’ in other words it should be understood as la‘annāhum bi-sabab naqdihim ‘We cursed them for the reason of their breaking’ their covenant and disbelieving in the signs of God and slaying the prophets wrongfully and for their saying to the Prophet s ‘Our hearts are covered up’ and cannot grasp what you say — nay but God sealed them for their disbelief and so they cannot heed any admonition; so they do not believe except for a few among them like ‘Abd Allāh b. Salām and his companions."
  4,156,"And for their disbelief a second time in Jesus the bā’ of bi-kufrihim ‘for their disbelief’ is repeated in order to separate it ‘their disbelief’ in Jesus from what is supplemented to it ‘their utterance against Mary’ and their uttering against Mary a tremendous calumny when they accused her of fornication."
  4,157,"And for their saying boastfully ‘We slew the Messiah Jesus son of Mary the Messenger of God’ as they claim in other words for all of these reasons We have punished them. God exalted be He says in repudiating their claim to have killed him And yet they did not slay him nor did they crucify him but he the one slain and crucified who was an associate of theirs the Jews was given the resemblance of Jesus. In other words God cast his Jesus’s likeness to him and so they thought it was him Jesus. And those who disagree concerning him that is concerning Jesus are surely in doubt regarding the slaying of him for some of them said when they saw the slain man the face is that of Jesus but the body is not his and so it is not he; and others said no it is he. They do not have any knowledge of the slaying of him only the pursuit of conjecture illā ittibā‘a l-zann is a discontinuous exception in other words ‘instead they follow conjecture regarding him that which they imagined they saw’; and they did not slay him for certain yaqīnan a circumstantial qualifier emphasising the denial of the slaying."
  4,158,"Nay God raised him up to Him. God is ever Mighty in His kingdom Wise in His actions."
  4,159,"And there is not one of the People of the Scripture but will assuredly believe in him in Jesus before his death that is before the death of one belonging to the People of the Scripture upon seeing the angels of death with his very eyes at which point his faith will not profit him; or it means before the death of Jesus after he descends at the approach of the Hour as is stated in hadīth; and on the Day of Resurrection he Jesus will be a witness against them of what they did when he was sent to them."
  4,160,"And because of the evildoing fa-bi-zulmin is to be understood as fa-bi-sababi zulmin ‘and for the reason of the evildoing’ of some of those of Jewry the Jews We have forbidden them certain good things that were lawful for them those things mentioned where God says And to those of Jewry We have forbidden every beast with claws Q. 6146; and because of their barring of people from God’s way from His religion many a time."
  4,161,"And because of their taking usury when they had been forbidden it in the Torah and their consuming people’s wealth through falsehood through bribes in adjudications and We have prepared for the disbelievers among them a painful chastisement."
  4,162,"But those of them who are firmly rooted established in knowledge like ‘Abd Allāh b. Salām and the believers the Emigrants and the Helpers believing in what has revealed to you and what was revealed before you of scriptures and those who observe the prayer wa’l-muqīmīna l-salāta is in the accusative because it is a laudative; it is also read in the nominative wa’l-muqīmūna l-salāta; and pay the alms and those who believe in God and the Last Day — to them We shall surely give nu’tīhim is also read yu’tīhim ‘He shall surely give’ a great wage namely Paradise."
