tafsir[14]{c,v,t}:
  21,11,"And how many did We destroy of towns — meaning its inhabitants — that had been wrongdoing disbelieving and brought forth another people after it!"
  21,12,"And when they felt Our might when the inhabitants of the town sensed destruction to be near behold they ran away from it they flee hastily therefrom."
  21,13,"But the angels said to them scornfully ‘Do not run away! Return to the opulence the comforts which you were given to enjoy and your dwelling-places that perhaps you might be asked’ for something of your worldly possessions as usual."
  21,14,"They said ‘O yā is for calling attention to something woe to us! this is our destruction! We have indeed been doing wrong’ through our disbelief."
  21,15,"So that saying remained their cry which they would make and repeat until We made them as reaped crops as crops harvested with sickles when they were killed with the sword stilled dead like the stillness of fire when it is extinguished."
  21,16,"And We did not create the heaven and the earth and all that is between them playing being frivolous but to indicate Our power and to benefit Our servants."
  21,17,"Had We desired to find some diversion that which provides diversion in the way of a partner or a child We would have found it with Ourselves from among the beautiful-eyed houris or angels were We to do so. But We did not do so thus We never desired it."
  21,18,"Nay but We hurl We cast the truth faith against falsehood disbelief and it obliterates it and behold it vanishes disappears damaghahu ‘it obliterates it’ actually means ‘it struck the brain with a blow’ a blow which is fatal. And for you O disbelievers of Mecca there shall be woe severe chastisement for what you ascribe to God of mate or child."
  21,19,"And to Him exalted be He belongs whoever is in the heavens and the earth as possessions and those who are near Him namely the angels wa-man ‘indahu the subject the predicate of which is the following clause do not disdain to worship Him nor do they weary."
  21,20,"They glorify Him night and day and they do not falter in it for it comes to them as naturally as breathing comes to us something which we can never be distracted from."
  21,21,"Or am functions with the meaning of bal ‘nay’ to effect a transition in subject-matter; the hamza is for rhetorical denial have they chosen gods that are from the earth such as stones gold or silver who that is gods who resurrect? who bring the dead back to life? No! Indeed only one who brings the dead back to life can be God."
  21,22,"Had there been in either of them that is in the heavens and the earth gods other than God that is other than Him the two would have surely deteriorated they the heavens and the earth would have deviated from their observed order because counteractive forces would exist among such gods as is usually the case when there is more than one ruler that there is counteraction and a lack of consensus regarding something. So glory be to God — an exaltation — the Lord the Creator of the Throne al-kursī above what they ascribe the disbelievers to God of His having a partner and otherwise."
  21,23,"He shall not be questioned about what He does but they shall be questioned about their actions."
  21,24,"Or have they chosen besides Him exalted be He other than Him gods? herein is an interrogative meant as a rebuke. Say ‘Bring your proof for this — but such a thing is impossible. This is the Remembrance of those with me namely my community and that Remembrance is the Qur’ān and the Remembrance of those before me of communities namely the Torah and the Gospel and other Books of God not a single one of which contains the statement that with God there exists another god in the way that they claim — exalted be He above such a thing. Nay but most of them do not know the truth the affirmation of God’s Oneness and so they are disregardful’ of that discernment that leads to knowledge of it."
