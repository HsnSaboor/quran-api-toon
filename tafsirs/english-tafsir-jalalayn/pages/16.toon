  2,102,"And they follow wa’ttaba‘ū is a supplement to nabadha ‘it cast away’ what the devils used to relate during the time of Solomon’s kingdom in the way of sorcery it is said that they the devils buried these books of sorcery underneath his throne when his kingdom was taken from him; it is also said that they used to listen stealthily and add fabrications to what they heard and then pass it on to the priests who would compile it in books; this would be disseminated and rumours spread that the jinn had knowledge of the Unseen. Solomon gathered these books and buried them. When he died the devils showed people where these books were and the latter brought them out and found that they contained sorcery and said ‘Your kingdom was only thanks to what is in here’; they then took to learning them and rejected the Scriptures of their prophets. In order to demonstrate Solomon’s innocence and in repudiation of the Jews when they said ‘Look at this Muhammad he mentions Solomon as one of the prophets when he was only a sorcerer’ God exalted says Solomon disbelieved not that is he did not work magic because he disbelieved but the devils disbelieved teaching the people sorcery this sentence is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the person governing the verb kafarū; and teaching them that which was revealed to the two angels that is the sorcery that they were inspired to perform al-malakayn ‘the two angels’ a variant reading has al-malikayn ‘the two kings’ who were in Babylon — a town in lower Iraq — Hārūt and Mārūt here the names are standing in for ‘the two angels’ or an explication of the latter. Ibn ‘Abbās said ‘They were two sorcerers who used to teach people magic’; it is also said that they were two angels that had been sent to teach sorcery to people as a trial from God. They taught not any man without them saying by way of counsel ‘We are but a temptation a trial from God for people so that He may test them when they are taught it whoever learns it is a disbeliever but whoever renounces it he is a believer; do not disbelieve’ by learning it; if this person refused and insisted on learning it they would teach him."
  2,103,"Yet if only they the Jews had believed in the Prophet and the Qur’ān and been fearful of God’s chastisement by abandoning acts of disobedience towards Him such as sorcery the response to the conditional clause beginning with law ‘if’ has been omitted but it is intimated to be ‘they would have been rewarded’ and this is indicated by His following words verily a reward from God would have been better than that for which they sold themselves if they had but known that this is better they would not have preferred that over this la-mathūbatun ‘verily the reward’ is the subject; the lām is that of oaths; and min ‘indi’Llāhi khayrun ‘from God would have been better’ is the predicate."
  2,104,"O you who believe do not say to the Prophet s ‘Observe us’ rā‘inā is an imperative form from murā‘āt which they used to say to him and this was a derogatory term in Hebrew derived from the noun al-ru‘ūna ‘thoughtlessness’. They found this very amusing and used to address the Prophet s in this way and so the believers were forbidden to use it; but say instead ‘Regard us’ that is look at us and give ear to what you are commanded and be prepared to accept it; and for disbelievers awaits a painful chastisement that is the Fire."
  2,105,"Those disbelievers of the People of the Scripture and the idolaters from among the Arabs al-mushrikīna ‘idolaters’ is a supplement to ahl al-kitābi ‘People of the Scripture’ and the min ‘of’ is explicative do not wish that any good any Inspiration should be revealed to you from your Lord out of envy of you but God singles out for His mercy for the office of His Prophet whom He will; God is of bounty abounding."
