tafsir[14]{c,v,t}:
  20,38,"when idh for explanation of that favour We revealed to your mother either in her sleep or by way of inspiration — when she gave birth to you and feared that Pharaoh would have you slain for being one of the newborn of the Children of Israel — that which was revealed regarding your affair this mā yūhā ‘that which was revealed’ is substituted by what follows an iqdhifīhi …"
  20,39,"“Cast him place him in the ark then cast him while in the ark into the river into the flow of the Nile and then the river shall throw him up onto the shore that is its bank the imperative here fa’l-yulqihi ‘let it throw him’ functions as a predicate; there an enemy of Mine and an enemy of his namely Pharaoh shall take him”. And after he took you I cast upon you love from Me that you may be loved by people; and indeed Pharaoh and all who saw you loved you; and that you might be reared under My eyes be nurtured under My guardianship and My protection of you."
  20,40,"When idh for explanation your sister Maryam walked up to obtain news of you for they had brought wet nurses for you but you would not take to the breast of any of them and she then said “Shall I show you someone who will take care of him?”. Her offer was accepted and so she brought them his mother and he took to her breasts. Thus We restored you to your mother that her eyes might rejoice in seeing you again and not grieve at that point anymore. Then you slew a soul namely the Copt in Egypt — and you became distressed for having slain him because of how Pharaoh would react; whereupon We delivered you from great distress and We tried you with various ordeals We tested you by landing you in some other ordeal and again delivered you from it. Then you stayed for several years ten years among the people of Midian after you had reached it having left Egypt staying with the prophet Shu‘ayb and marrying his daughter. Then you came hither as ordained in My knowledge with the Message that you will deliver — and this was when you were forty years old O Moses!"
  20,41,"And I chose you for Myself to deliver the Message."
  20,42,"Go you and your brother to the people with My nine signs and do not flag be remiss in remembrance of Me by uttering glorifications and otherwise."
  20,43,"Go the two of you to Pharaoh. Truly he has transgressed the bounds in claiming to be the Lord."
  20,44,"And speak to him gentle words for him to renounce such claims that perhaps he may be mindful be admonished or fear’ God and so repent — the ‘hope’ for Pharaoh’s repentance is expressed from their perspective for God knows that he was not going to repent."
  20,45,"The two of them said ‘Our Lord We truly fear that he may forestall us that is by hastening to punish us or become tyrannical’ against us that is be high-handed with us."
  20,46,"He said ‘Do not fear for I shall be with the two of you by providing you with My assistance hearing what he says and seeing what he does."
  20,47,"So go to him and say “Truly we are two messengers of your Lord so let the Children of Israel go with us to Syria and do not continue to chastise them in other words release them from your exploitation of them in those oppressive works of yours such as digging construction and the lifting of heavy objects. We have verily brought you a sign a definitive argument from your Lord as proof of our truthfulness in delivering the Message; and may peace be upon him who follows right guidance that is to say may he be secure from God’s chastisement."
  20,48,"Indeed it has been revealed to us that the chastisement shall befall him who denies the truth of what we have brought and turns away” ’ and who rejects it. And so they came to him and said to him all of what has been mentioned."
  20,49,"He said ‘So who is your Lord O Moses?’ — he Pharaoh restricted this question to him Moses because between him and Aaron he is the principal bearer of God’s Message and also because of his Pharaoh’s having pampered him while he was being reared as a child."
  20,50,"He said ‘Our Lord is He Who gave to everything in creation its peculiar nature through which it is distinguished from another thing and then guided it’ the animal among them to its source of food drink and procreation and in other ways."
  20,51,"He Pharaoh said ‘So what of the status of the generations the communities of old?’ such as the people of Noah Hūd Lot and Sālih with regard to their having worshipped graven images."
