tafsir[15]{c,v,t}:
  23,60,"and who give what they give of voluntary alms and righteous deeds while their hearts tremble with awe fearful lest it not be accepted from them because the particle lām ‘for’ is taken as implied before annahum ‘that they’ they are going to return to their Lord —"
  23,61,"those are the ones who hasten to perform good works and they are the ones who shall come out ahead in them according to God’s knowledge."
  23,62,"And We do not task any soul beyond its capacity what it can bear — thus he who is not able to pray standing let him pray sitting down and he who is not able to fast let him eat; and with Us is a Record that speaks the truth regarding what it a soul has done — and this Record is the Preserved Tablet al-lawh al-mahfūz wherein deeds are written down; and they namely the souls in their acts will not be wronged in a single thing thereof and so nothing is diminished of the reward for good deeds nor is anything extra added to the evil deeds."
  23,63,"Nay but their hearts that is the hearts of the disbelievers are in ignorance of this Qur’ān and they have other deeds which they will perpetrate besides the ones mentioned against the believers and they will therefore be chastised for them."
  23,64,"Indeed hattā is for inceptiveness when We seize their affluent ones their wealthy and their leaders with chastisement with the sword on the day of Badr behold! they are supplicating loudly clamouring in supplication. It is then said to them"
  23,65,"‘Do not supplicate out loud on this day! Truly you will not receive help you will not be protected against Us."
  23,66,"Verily My signs in the Qur’ān used to be recited to you but you used to take to your heels falling back in retreat"
  23,67,"disdainful of embracing faith because of it that is because of the Sacred House or the Meccan Sanctuary and their being inhabitants thereof secure in contrast to the situation with all other peoples in their hometowns while in your night sessions sāmiran is a circumstantial qualifier in other words they come together to converse at night around the Sacred House you talked nonsense’ if read as tahjurūna the third form from hajara means while ‘you disregarded’ the Qur’ān; but if read as the fourth form tuhjirūna from ahjara it means while ‘you speak falsehood’ about the Prophet and the Qur’ān."
  23,68,"God exalted be He says Have they not contemplated yaddabbarū should actually be yatadabbarū but the tā’ has been assimilated with the dāl the discourse namely the Qur’ān that is proof of the Prophet’s sincerity or has there come upon them that which has not come upon their forefathers?"
  23,69,"Or is it that they do not recognise their own Messenger and so they reject him?"
  23,70,"Or do they say ‘There is a madness in him’? — this interrogative is meant as an affirmation of the truth of the Prophet’s sincerity and of the fact that messengers did come to past communities and of the fact that they do indeed recognise their Messenger to be truthful and trustworthy and of the fact that there is no madness in him. Nay bal is for transition he has brought them the truth namely the Qur’ān that comprises affirmations of the Oneness of God and the Laws of Islam; but most of them are averse to the truth."
  23,71,"And if the truth namely the Qur’ān had followed their desires and come to them with mention of what they fancied in the way of God having a partner and a child may God be exalted above such associations indeed the heavens and the earth and whoever is in them would have been corrupted they the heavens and the earth would have deviated from their observed order because contradictions would ensue as is usually the case when there is more than one ruler. Nay We have brought them their Remembrance namely the Qur’ān in which they are remembered and honoured but they are disregardful of their own Remembrance."
  23,72,"Or do you ask them for any recompense? any remuneration in return for the faith that you have brought them? Yet the recompense of your Lord is His remuneration His reward and His provision are better one reading has kharjan ‘recompense’ in both instances sc. kharjan fa-kharju; another has kharājan in both sc. kharājan fa-kharāju and He is the best of providers the best of givers and remunerators."
  23,73,"And truly you summon them to a straight path a straight route that is the religion of Islam."
  23,74,"And truly those who do not believe in the Hereafter in resurrection reward and punishment deviate swerve away from the path that is the route to salvation."
