tafsir[10]{c,v,t}:
  10,79,"And Pharaoh said ‘Bring me every cunning sorcerer’ every individual excelling in the art of sorcery."
  10,80,"And when the sorcerers came Moses said to them after they had said to him Either you cast or we shall be the casters! Q. 7115 ‘Cast your cast!’"
  10,81,"Then when they had cast their ropes and staffs Moses said ‘What mā is interrogative and the subject its predicate being the following ji’tum bihi have you brought? Sorcery? ā’l-sihru a-al-sihru is a substitute for the predicate ji’tum bihi ‘have you brought’; a variant reading has al-sihru with a single hamza making it predicative in which case mā is the relative particle of the subject Verily God will bring it to nothing He will efface it. Truly God does not make right the work of those who do corruption."
  10,82,"And God will vindicate He will establish and make prevail the Truth by His words by His promises however much the sinners be averse’."
  10,83,"But with Moses none believed save a few descendants a party of the children of his that is Pharaoh’s folk out of fear of Pharaoh and their council that he Pharaoh might persecute them turn them away from his Moses’s religion by torturing them; and truly Pharaoh was despotic arrogant in the land the land of Egypt and truly he was of the prodigal of those who transgress the bounds by claiming to be Lords."
  10,84,"And Moses said ‘O my people if you have believed in God then put your trust in Him if you have truly submitted to Him’."
  10,85,"So they said ‘In God we have put our trust. Our Lord make us not a cause of temptation for the evildoing folk that is do not make them prevail over us lest they then think that they are upon the right path and so end up succumbing to the temptation of thinking that they are upon the right path because of us;"
  10,86,"and deliver us by Your mercy from the unbelieving folk’."
  10,87,"And We inspired Moses and his brother saying ‘Appoint houses for your people in Egypt and make your houses oratories places in which to perform prayers so that you might be secure from fear — for Pharaoh had prohibited them from performing prayers — and establish fulfil worship; and give good tidings to the believers’ of victory and Paradise."
  10,88,"And Moses said ‘Our Lord You have indeed given Pharaoh and his council splendour and riches in the life of this world. Our Lord You have given them this that they may lead people astray as a consequence thereof from Your way from Your religion. Our Lord obliterate transform their riches and harden their hearts stamp upon them and shackle them so that they do not believe until they see the painful chastisement’ he Moses invoked God against them and Aaron said ‘Amen’ at the end of his invocation."
