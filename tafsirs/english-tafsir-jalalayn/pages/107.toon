tafsir[3]{c,v,t}:
  5,3,"Forbidden to you is carrion that is the consumption of it and blood that is what has been spilt as mentioned in sūrat al-An‘ām Q. 6145 and the flesh of swine and what has been hallowed to other than God in that it was sacrificed in the name of something other than Him and the beast strangled to death and the beast beaten down to death and the beast fallen from a height to its death and the beast gored to death by another and what beasts of prey have devoured of such animals — except for what you have sacrificed duly catching it while it still breathes life and then sacrificing it — and what has been sacrificed in the name of idols nusub is the plural of nusāb and that you apportion that is that you demand an oath or a ruling through the divining of arrows azlām the plural of zalam or zulam which is a qidh ‘a small arrow’ without feathers or a head. There were seven of these arrows marked with flags and they were retained by the keeper of the Ka‘ba. They would use them for abitrations and when they commanded them they obeyed and if they prohibited them they would desist; that is wickedness a rebellion against obedience. And on the Day of ‘Arafa in the year of the Farewell Pilgrimage the following was revealed Today the disbelievers have despaired of your religion of you apostatising from it having hoped for it earlier for now they perceived its strength; therefore do not fear them but fear Me. Today I have perfected your religion for you that is its rulings and obligations after this verse nothing about what is lawful or unlawful was revealed and I have completed My favour upon you by perfecting it your religion but it is also said by effecting their safe entry into Mecca; and I have approved chosen Islam for you as religion. But whoever is constrained by emptiness by hunger to consume some of what has been forbidden him and consumes it not inclining purposely to sin to an act of disobedience — then God is Forgiving to him for what he has consumed Merciful to him by permitting it to him in contrast to the one who purposely inclines to sin that is the one actively engaged in it such as a waylayer or a criminal for whom such consumption is forbidden."
  5,4,"They will ask you O Muhammad (s) about what food is made lawful for them. Say ‘The good delicious things are made lawful for you; and the quarry of hunting creatures dogs wildcats or birds that catch food you have taught training them as hounds mukallibīn is a circumstantial qualifier derived from kallabtu al-kalba meaning ‘I released the hound against the quarry’ teaching them tu‘allimūnahunna is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the subject of mukallibīn ‘training them as hounds’ in other words ‘disciplining them’ of what God has taught you of the art of hunting; so eat what they have caught for you even if they have killed it as long as they have not eaten any of it. This is in contrast to the untrained hunting creatures whose catch is not lawful for consumption the mark of these being trained hunting creatures is that they should return after they have been sent out that they can be curbed when cried at and that they can seize the quarry without eating of it; the minimum number of times by which this may be known is three. If they eat any of it then it cannot be counted as ‘what they have caught’ for their trainers and is consequently unlawful for consumption as reported in hadīth in both of the Sahīhs of Bukhārī and Muslim — therein it is also mentioned that a catch made by an arrow over which God’s name is mentioned is equivalent in lawfulness to the catch of trained hunting creatures. And mention God’s name over it when you unleash it. And fear God. Indeed God is swift at the reckoning’."
  5,5,"Today the good the delicious things are permitted to you and the food of those who were given the Scripture that is animals slaughtered by the Jews and Christians is permitted to you and permitted to them is your food. Likewise the believing free married women and the married women of those who were given the Scripture before you are permitted to you for marriage if you give them their wages their dowries in wedlock in marriage and not illicitly fornicating overtly with them or taking them as lovers so as to fornicate with them secretly. Whoever disbelieves in faith that is whose apostatises his prior good work has indeed failed and so it counts for nothing and he will not be rewarded for it and in the Hereafter he shall be among the losers if he dies in this state of unbelief."
