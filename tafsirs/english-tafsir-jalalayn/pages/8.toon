tafsir[9]{c,v,t}:
  2,49,"And remember when We delivered you your forefathers the address here and henceforth directed to those living at the time of the our Prophet is about how God blessed their forefathers and is intended to remind them of God’s grace so that they might believe; from the folk of Pharaoh who were visiting you with that is making you taste evil chastisement of the worst kind the sentence here is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the person of the pronoun suffixed in najjaynākum ‘We delivered you’; slaughtering your newly-born sons this is explaining what has just been said; and sparing retaining your women doing so because of the saying of some of their priests that a child born among the Israelites shall bring about the end of your rule Pharaoh; and for you therein chastisement or deliverance was a tremendous trial a test or a grace from your Lord."
  2,50,"And remember when We divided split in two for you on account of you the sea such that you were able to cross it and escape from your enemy; and We delivered you from drowning and drowned Pharaoh’s folk his people with him while you were beholding the sea crashing down on top of them."
  2,51,"And when We appointed for wā‘adnā or wa‘adnā Moses forty nights at the end of which We shall give him the Torah for you to implement then you took to yourselves the calf the one which the Samaritan fashioned for you as a god after him that is after he departed for Our appointment and you were evildoers for taking it in worship because you directed your worship to the wrong place."
  2,52,"Then We pardoned you erasing your sins after that act of worship so that you might be thankful for Our favour upon you."
  2,53,"And when We gave to Moses the Scripture the Torah and the Criterion wa’l-furqān is an explicative supplement of Torah that is the one that discriminates faraqa between truth and falsehood and between what is licit and illicit so that you might be guided by it away from error."
  2,54,"And when Moses said to his people those who worshipped the calf ‘My people you have done wrong against yourselves by your taking the golden calf for a god; now turn to your Creator away from that worship of the calf and slay one another that is let the innocent of you slay the guilty; That slaughter will be better for you in your Creator’s sight’ who made it easier for you to accomplish this and sent down a dark cloud over you so that none of you was able to see the other and show him mercy such that almost seventy thousand of you were killed; and He will turn to you relenting before your turning in repentance; truly He is the Relenting the Merciful."
  2,55,"And when you said having gone out with Moses to apologise before God for your worship of the calf and having heard what he had said to you; ‘O Moses we will not believe you till we see God openly’ with our own eyes; and the thunderbolt the shout took you and you died while you were beholding what was happening to you."
  2,56,"Then We raised you up brought you back to life after you were dead so that you might be thankful for this favour of Ours."
  2,57,"And We made the cloud overshadow you that is We sheltered you with fine clouds from the heat of the sun while you were in the wilderness; and We sent down in them the clouds upon you manna and quails — which are respectively a type of citrus known as turunjabīn and the quail — and We said ‘Eat of the good things We have provided for you’ and do not store any of it away but they were not grateful for this favour and stored the food and so they were deprived of it; And they did not wrong Us in this but themselves they wronged since the evil consequences of this befell them."
