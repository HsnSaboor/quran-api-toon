  18,35,"And he entered his garden taking with him his companion accompanying him all around it showing him its fruits — God does not say here his ‘two gardens’ because what is meant is the beautiful part of the garden rawda; or because to mention just one suffices — having wronged himself through his disbelief. He said ‘I do not think that all this will ever perish become non-existent."
  18,36,"Moreover I do not think that the Hour will ever come; and even if I am indeed returned to my Lord in the Hereafter according to your claim I shall surely find better than this as a resort’ as a place of return."
  18,37,"His companion said to him as he conversed with him responding to him ‘Do you disbelieve in Him Who created you of dust — as Adam was created of it — then of a drop of fluid of semen then fashioned you made you upright and gave you the form of a man?"
  18,38,"But lo lākinnā is actually made up of lākin anā ‘but I … ’ where the hamza vowel has either been transferred onto the nūn of lākin or omitted altogether with the nūn assimilated with the like of it He is huwa this is the pronoun of the subject matter to be stated and is clarified by the sentence that follows it the meaning in other words is ‘But it is that I say that He is’ God my Lord and I do not ascribe any partner to my Lord."
  18,39,"And if only when you entered your garden you had said upon admiring it ‘This is “What God has willed. There is no power except in God”. In a hadīth it is stated that ‘Whoever is given something good in the way of family or wealth and upon receiving it says “What God wills comes to pass; there is no power except in God” mā shā’a’Llāh lā quwwata illā bi’Llāh he will never experience any ill therefrom’. If you see me anā is a pronoun separating two direct objects as less than you in wealth and children"
  18,40,"maybe my Lord will give me something better than your garden this is the response to the conditional clause beginning with lawlā ‘and if only’ and unleash upon it bolts husbān is the plural of husbāna that is to say thunderbolts from the heaven so that it becomes a bare plain a piece of smooth ground upon which no foot can stand firm;"
  18,41,"or maybe its water will sink deep down ghawran functions in meaning like ghā’iran and it constitutes a supplement to yursila ‘He will unleash’ but not a supplement to tusbiha ‘it becomes’ because the sinking of water deep into the earth does not necessarily result from thunderbolts so that you have no means of acquiring it’ no possible way of reaching it."
  18,42,"And his fruit was beset through the curbing measures mentioned above it was beset together with his garden by destruction and were thus ruined and so he began to wring his hands out of regret and anguish because of what he had spent on it on the cultivation of his garden as it lay fallen having collapsed on its trellises those supporting the vines so that first these collapsed and then the vine-grapes collapsed after them saying ‘O yā is for exclamation I wish I had not ascribed any partner to my Lord!’"
  18,43,"But there was no read takun or yakun party no persons to help him besides God at the moment of its destruction nor could he help himself at the moment of its destruction all by himself."
  18,44,"There that is on the Day of Resurrection all protection walāya; if read wilāya then it means ‘sovereignty’ belongs to God the True if read as al-haqqu then it is as an adjective qualifying walāya or wilāya or if read as al-haqqi then it is an attribute of God’s Majesty. He is better at rewarding than the rewarding of any person other than Him if such a person were in a position to reward; and best in consequence read ‘uquban or ‘uqban He is best in terms of the consequence for believers both thawāban ‘rewarding’ and ‘uqban ‘consequence’ are in the accusative for the purpose of specification."
  18,45,"And strike draw for them your people the similitude of the life of this world mathala’l-hayāti’l-dunyā constitutes the first direct object as water ka-mā’in the second direct object which We send down out from the heaven and the vegetation of the earth mingles with it the vegetation multiplies by the sending down of the water; or it is that the water mixes with the vegetation such that it is nourished and flourishes; and it then becomes the vegetation becomes chaff dried up its various parts broken up in fragments scattered strewn and dispersed by the winds which then blow it away. The import is the life of this world is likened to flourishing vegetation which then becomes dry is broken up and scattered by the winds a variant reading for riyāh ‘winds’ has rīh. And God is Omnipotent Powerful over all things."
