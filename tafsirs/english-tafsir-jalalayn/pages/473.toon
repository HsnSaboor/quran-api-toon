tafsir[9]{c,v,t}:
  40,50,"They that is the keepers will say mockingly ‘Did not your messengers bring you clear signs?’ manifest miracles? They will say ‘Yes indeed’ — in other words they disbelieved them. They will say ‘Then supplicate God!’ yourselves for we do not intercede for disbelievers. God exalted be He says but the supplications of the disbelievers can only be misguided void."
  40,51,"Truly We shall help Our messengers and those who believe in the life of this world and on the day when the witnesses rise up ashhād is the plural of shāhid — these are the angels who will testify in support of the messengers that they indeed delivered their Messages and against the disbelievers that they denied them;"
  40,52,"the day when their excuses will not benefit read lā yanfa‘u or lā tanfa‘u the evildoers even if they were to offer them and theirs will be the curse in other words the banishment from God’s Mercy and theirs will be the ills of the ultimate abode in the Hereafter meaning the most severe of its chastisements."
  40,53,"And verily We gave Moses the guidance the Torah and miracles and We made the Children of Israel after Moses heirs to the scripture the Torah"
  40,54,"as a guidance to guide and as a remembrance for people of pith a reminder for possessors of intellect."
  40,55,"So be patient O Muhammad (s). Surely God’s promise to grant victory to His friends is true — for you and whoever follows you are among such friends. And ask forgiveness for your sin so that you will be emulated in this by your community and glorify perform prayer continuously with praise of your Lord at night — which means after sunset — and in the early hours the five prayers."
  40,56,"Truly those who dispute the signs of God the Qur’ān without any warrant any evidence that has come to them — there is only vanity in their breasts only arrogance and an evil desire to get the better of you which they will never attain and satisfy. So seek refuge with God from their evil. Surely He is the Hearer of their sayings the Seer of their state."
  40,57,"The following was revealed regarding the deniers of resurrection Assuredly the creation of the heavens and the earth as an unprecedented first act is greater than the creation of mankind a second time — which is the restoration of them after death; but most people namely the disbelievers of Mecca do not know this and so they are like the blind whereas those who know it are like those who have sight."
  40,58,"And the blind one and the seer are not equal; nor are they equal those who believe and perform righteous deeds — such a person being the virtuous one — and the evildoer wa-lā’l-musī’u lā here is extra. Little do they reflect little are they admonished read yatadhakkarūna or second person plural tatadhakkarūna ‘do you reflect’ in other words their reflections are very few."
