tafsir[7]{c,v,t}:
  39,41,"Truly We have revealed the Book to you for the sake of mankind with the truth bi’l-haqqi is semantically connected to anzalnā ‘We have revealed’. So whoever is guided then it his being guided is for the sake of his own soul and whoever goes astray goes astray only to the detriment thereof. And you are not meant to be a guardian over them and so compel them to embrace guidance."
  39,42,"God takes the souls at the time of their death and He takes those that have not died in their sleep in other words He takes them during sleep. Then He retains those for whom He has ordained death and releases the others until an appointed term that is until the time of their death. The one that is released is the soul that possesses the faculty of discernment without which the soul containing the force of life is able to remain temporarily — but this cannot be the other way round. Truly in that mentioned there are signs indications for a people who reflect and then realise that the One with the power to do this also has the power to resurrect — Quraysh however never reflected on this fact."
  39,43,"Or have they — nay but they have — taken besides God idols as gods to act as intercessors? with God as they are wont to allege. Say to them ‘What! will they intercede even though they have no power whatever of intercession or otherwise and are unable to comprehend?’ that you worship them or to comprehend anything else for that matter? Nay."
  39,44,"Say ‘All intercession belongs solely to God that is to say He has exclusive control over it and so none can intercede except with His permission. To Him belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth; then to Him you will be brought back’."
  39,45,"And when God is mentioned alone that is without the mention of their gods thereat shrink they are repelled and they become constricted the hearts of those who do not believe in the Hereafter; but when those others besides Him namely the idols are mentioned behold they rejoice!"
  39,46,"Say ‘O God! Allāhumma means yā Allāh Originator of the heavens and the earth! the Creator of them without precedent Knower of the Unseen and the visible Knower of what is hidden and what is witnessed You will judge between Your servants concerning that wherein they used to differ’ in the matter of religion guide me to the truth over which they are at variance."
  39,47,"And even if the evildoers possessed all that is in the earth and as much of it besides they would surely offer it to ransom themselves from the terrible chastisement on the Day of Resurrection. And there will appear there will become manifest to them from God that which they had never reckoned what they never supposed they would see."
