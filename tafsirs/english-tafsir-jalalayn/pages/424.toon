tafsir[7]{c,v,t}:
  33,44,"Their greeting from Him exalted be He on the day they encounter Him will be ‘Peace’ extended to them by the tongues of the angels. And He has prepared for them a noble reward namely Paradise."
  33,45,"O Prophet! Indeed We have sent you as a witness against those to whom you have were sent and as a bearer of good tidings for those who affirm your sincerity of Paradise and as a warner for those who deny you of the punishment of the Fire"
  33,46,"and as a summoner to God to obedience to Him by His leave by His command and as a illuminating lamp in other words the equivalent of it in terms of one’s being able to find guidance therewith."
  33,47,"And give good tidings to the believers that there will be for them a great bounty from God namely Paradise."
  33,48,"And do not obey the disbelievers and the hypocrites in assenting to do what contravenes your Law; and disregard leave aside their injuriousness — do not retaliate against them for it until you receive a command from God regarding how to deal with them. And put your trust in God for He will suffice you and God suffices as Guardian One to Whom matters are entrusted."
  33,49,"O you who believe if you marry believing women and then divorce them before you have touched them read tamassūhunna or tumāsūhunna that is before you have copulated with them there shall be no waiting period for you to reckon against them no waiting period needed to preclude pregnancy or otherwise. But provide for them give them what they can use for securing comforts in cases where no dowry has been fixed for them; otherwise theirs is to retain half of what was fixed but no more — this is what Ibn ‘Abbās said and it is the opinion followed by al-Shāfi‘ī’; and release them in a gracious manner leave them be without the intention to cause them any harm."
  33,50,"O Prophet! Indeed We have made lawful for you your wives whom you have given their dowries and what your right hand owns of those whom God has given you as spoils of war from the disbelievers whom you have taken captive such as Safiyya and Juwayriyya and the daughters of your paternal uncles and the daughters of your paternal aunts and the daughters of your maternal uncles and the daughters of your maternal aunts who emigrated with you as opposed to those who did not emigrate and any believing woman if she gift herself in marriage to the Prophet and if the Prophet desire to take her in marriage and ask for her hand in marriage without paying her a dowry — a privilege for you exclusively not for the rest of the believers nikāh ‘marriage’ when expressed by the term hiba ‘gift’ denotes marriage without dowry. Indeed We know what We have imposed upon them namely the believers with respect to their wives in the way of rulings to the effect that they should not take more than four wives and should only marry with the consent of a legal guardian the presence of witnesses and the payment of a dowry and with respect to what their right hands own of slavegirls in the way of purchase or otherwise so that the handmaiden be one lawful for her master such as a slavegirl belonging to the People of the Scripture kitābiyya and not a Magian or an idolater and that she should be ascertained as not carrying child with the necessary waiting period istibrā’ before copulation; so that li-kaylā is semantically connected to what came before this last statement there may be no unnecessary restriction for you no constraint in marriage for you. And God is Forgiving of what is difficult to guard against Merciful in giving dispensations allowing for latitude in this respect."
