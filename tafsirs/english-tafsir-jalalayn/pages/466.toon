tafsir[7]{c,v,t}:
  39,68,"And the Trumpet will be blown for the First Blast and whoever is in the heavens and whoever is in the earth will swoon will die except whomever God wills such as the houris the beautiful youths of Paradise and others. Then it will be blown again and behold they that is all creatures who are dead will rise up looking on waiting to see what will be done with them."
  39,69,"And the earth will shine with the light of its Lord when God reveals Himself for the passing of judgement and the Book of deeds shall be set in place for the Reckoning and the prophets and witnesses namely Muhammad (s) and his community will be brought to bear witness that the messengers delivered the Message to their respective communities. And judgement will be made between them with truth in other words justly and they will not be wronged in a single thing."
  39,70,"And every soul will be paid in full for what it did that is it will be paid the requital thereof and He is best aware of what they do and has no need for any witnesses."
  39,71,"And those who disbelieve will be driven violently to Hell in troops in separate groups until when they reach it its gates are opened futihat abwābuhā is the response to idhā ‘when’ and its keepers will say to them ‘Did there not come to you any messengers from among yourselves reciting to you the signs of your Lord the Qur’ān and otherwise and warning you of the encounter of this day of yours?’ They will say ‘Yes indeed; but the word of chastisement — namely the verse Assuredly I will fill Hell … Q. 11119 — against the disbelievers has been fulfilled’."
  39,72,"It will be said ‘Enter the gates of Hell to abide therein’ — decreed for you to abide therein. For evil indeed is the abode of the arrogant!’"
  39,73,"And those who feared their Lord will be driven gently to Paradise in troops until when they reach it and its gates are opened wa-futihat the wāw here indicates a circumstantial qualifier implying qad ‘already’ and its keepers will say to them ‘Peace be to you! You are good! tibtum a circumstantial qualifier So enter it to abide therein’ — enter it with the decree that you are to abide in it forever the response to idhā ‘when’ is implicit and is in other words dakhalūhā ‘they enter it’. The manner of their being driven as well as the opening of the gates before their arrival is a way of honouring them; the driving of the disbelievers however and the opening of the gates only upon their arrival so that all of its heat is retained for them is a means of humiliating them."
  39,74,"And they will say this is a supplement to the implicit response dakhalūhā ‘they enter it’ ‘Praise be to God Who has fulfilled His promise to us of Paradise and has made us inherit the land the land of Paradise that we may settle in Paradise wherever we wish’ for it is all Paradise and there is no spot that can be preferred to another. So how excellent is Paradise as the reward of those who worked hard!"
