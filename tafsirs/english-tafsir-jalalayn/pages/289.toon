tafsir[9]{c,v,t}:
  17,67,"And when distress difficulty befalls you at sea such as fear of drowning those whom you are wont to invoke are no longer present those whom you are wont to worship of gods are no longer present and so you do not call on them — except Him exalted be He for on Him alone you do call because you are suffering a distress which only He can remove. But when He delivers you from drowning and brings you to land you are rejective of God’s Oneness for man is ever ungrateful ever denying God’s graces."
  17,68,"Do you feel secure that He will not cause a side of the earth in other words the land to swallow you up as He did with Korah Qārūn or unleash upon you a squall of pebbles? that is hurl a shower of stones upon you as He did with the people of Lot. Then you will not find for yourselves any guardian any protector from Him."
  17,69,"Or do you feel secure that He will not return you to it that is to the sea a second time and unleash upon you a shattering gale that is a violent wind that shatters everything in its path to destroy your ship and drown you for your ungratefulness? And then you will not find for yourselves any redresser of this against Us any helper or advocate to demand restitution from Us for what We will have done to you."
  17,70,"And verily We have honoured We have preferred the Children of Adam above other creation by giving them knowledge speech and their being a creation of even proportions amongst other things including their means of purification after death and carried them over land on animal-back and sea in ships and provided them with good things and We have preferred them above many of those whom We created such as livestock and wild animals with a marked preferment the min of mimman ‘of those whom’ has the sense of mā ‘of what’ or something close to it and includes the angels the purpose being to give preference to the angelic genus; there is no requirement to give explicit preference to the individuals of this category of being since they angels are superior to mankind excepting the prophets."
  17,71,"Mention the day when We shall summon all men with their leader their prophet and it will be said ‘O community of so-and-so’; or it bi-imāmihim means ‘with the record of their deeds’ in which case it will be said ‘O one of good deeds O one of evil deeds!’ this is on the Day of Resurrection. And whoever from among them is given his book in his right hand these being the fortunate those possessors of understanding in this world — those will read their book and they will not be wronged they will not be diminished of their deeds so much as a single date-thread."
  17,72,"And whoever has been in this that is in this world blind to the truth will be blind in the Hereafter to the path of salvation and the reciting of the Qur’ān and even further astray from the right way more removed from the road that leads to it."
  17,73,"The following was revealed regarding the tribe of Thaqīf for they had asked him the Prophet s to declare their valley inviolable and implored him to grant them this request And indeed wa-in the particle in is softened they were about to they nearly did beguile you away from that which We revealed to you so that you might invent against Us something other than that; and then had you done that they would have taken you as a friend."
  17,74,"And if We had not made you stand firm upon the Truth by way of divine protection ‘isma certainly you might have you nearly inclined to them a little because of the extent of their deception and their persistence. This statement is explicit about the fact that the Prophet s neither inclined nor came close to doing so."
  17,75,"Then had you inclined We would have surely made you taste a double chastisement in life and a double chastisement upon death in other words twice the chastisement that any other person would receive in this world and the Hereafter. Then you would not have found for yourself any helper against Us anyone to shield you from it."
