tafsir[7]{c,v,t}:
  4,45,"God has better knowledge of your enemies than you do and He informs you of them in order that you avoid them. God suffices as a Protector a Preserver of you from them God suffices as a Helper defending you against their plotting."
  4,46,"Some group from among the Jews distort alter the words that God revealed in the Torah pertaining to the descriptions of Muhammad (s) from their contexts those contexts in which they were placed and they say to the Prophet s when he commands them something ‘We have heard your words and we disobey your command; and hear as one who does not hear’ wa’sma‘ ghayr musma‘in is a circumstantial qualifier functioning as an invocation in other words ‘And may you not hear!’ and they say to him ‘Mind us’ rā‘inā a term with which it had been forbidden to address him being a curse word in their language; twisting distorting with their tongues and slandering defaming religion Islam. If they had said ‘We have heard and obey’ instead of ‘And we disobey’ and only ‘Hear’ and ‘Consider us’ unzur ilaynā instead of rā‘inā it would have been better for them than what they said and more upright more just than that but God has cursed them removing them from His mercy for their unbelief so they believe not except a few among them such as ‘Abd Allāh b. Salām and his companions."
  4,47,"O you who have been given the Scripture believe in what We have revealed of the Qur’ān confirming what is with you of the Torah before We obliterate faces erasing the eyes noses and eyebrows in them and turn them inside out and make them like the napes of the neck a flat plate or curse them by transforming them into apes as We cursed as We transformed those of the Sabbath among them and God’s command His decree is done after this was revealed ‘Abd Allāh b. Salām converted to Islam and so it was said that this had been a conditional threat of punishment so that when some of them converted to Islam it the threat was lifted. It is also said that obliteration and transformation will take place before the rising of the Hour."
  4,48,"God forgives not that anything should be associated with Him. But He forgives other than save that of sins to whomever He wills forgiveness for by admitting him into Paradise without punishment. And whomever He wills of the believers He punishes for their sins and then admits them into Paradise. Whoever associates anything with God then he has indeed invented a tremendous a great sin."
  4,49,"Have you not seen those who praise themselves for purity? namely the Jews when they say ‘We are God’s children and His beloved’ in other words it is not a matter of their purifying themselves. Nay God purifies whom He will through faith and they shall not be wronged they shall not be diminished of their deeds a single date-thread as much as the peel on a date-stone."
  4,50,"Consider in amazement how they invent falsehood against God in that way and that suffices for a clear an evident sin."
  4,51,"The following was revealed regarding Ka‘b b. al-Ashraf and other such scholars from among the Jews when they came to Mecca and saw those killed at Badr and began to incite the idolaters to avenge them their dead by waging war against the Prophet s Have you not seen those who were given a share of the Book how they believe in al-Jibt and al-Tāghūt two idols belonging to Quraysh and say to the disbelievers to Abū Sufyān and his companions when they the latter said to them ‘Are we who are the guardians of the House who give drink to the pilgrim offer hospitality to the guest set free the captive and do such and such … not more rightly guided than Muhammad he who has contravened the religion of his forefathers severed the ties of kinship and abandoned the Sanctuary?’ ‘These in other words you are more rightly guided upon a more upright way than the believers’?"
