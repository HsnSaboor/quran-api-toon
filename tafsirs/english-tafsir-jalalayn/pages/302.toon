tafsir[9]{c,v,t}:
  18,75,"He said ‘Did I not say to you that you would never be able to bear with me?’ laka ‘to you’ has been added to that same statement which was made before because this time there could not be any excuse for Moses’s impatience."
  18,76,"And for this reason he said ‘If I ask you about anything after this after this instance then do not keep me in your company do not allow me to follow you for truly you will have found from me read ladunnī or ladunī on my part sufficient enough excuse’ for you to part company with me."
  18,77,"So they set off until when they came to the folk of a certain town namely Antioch Antākya they asked its folk for food they asked them for food by way of hospitality but they refused to extend them any hospitality. They then found in it a wall one hundred cubits high about to collapse that is it was close to falling down because of its tilt; so he al-Khidr straightened it with his own hands. He Moses said to him ‘Had you wished you could have taken a variant reading for la-ttakhadhta has la-takhidhta a wage for it’ some sort of payment since they did not extend us any hospitality despite our need for food."
  18,78,"Said he al-Khidr to him ‘This is the parting that is the moment for parting between me and you baynī wa-baynika here the preposition bayna has been annexed to a non-multiple noun but this is allowed grammatically because it is then repeated with its other noun together with the coordinating wāw. I will inform you before I part company with you the interpretation of that over which you were not able to maintain patience."
  18,79,"As for the ship it belonged to poor people ten in number who earned a living on the sea with it leasing it to others as a way of gaining a living; and I wanted to make it defective for behind them whenever they returned — or meaning before them now — was a king a disbeliever seizing every ship that was usable by force ghasban is in the accusative as a verbal noun containing an explanation of the nature of such ‘seizure’."
  18,80,"And as for the boy his parents were believers and We feared lest he should overwhelm them with insolence and disbelief — for he is as described by the hadīth of Muslim ‘He was incorrigibly disposed to disbelief and had he lived longer this disposition of his would have oppressed them because of their love for him they would have followed him in such a path of disbelief’."
  18,81,"So We desired that their Lord should give them in exchange read yubaddilahumā or yubdilahumā one better than him in purity that is in righteousness and God-fearing and closer than him to mercy read ruhman or ruhuman in other words it is to be understood as rahmatan ‘by way of mercy’ namely closer to dutifulness towards his parents. Thus God exalted be He gave them in exchange a girl who afterwards married a prophet and gave birth to a prophet through whom God guided an entire community."
  18,82,"And as for the wall it belonged to two orphan boys who lived in the city and beneath it there was a treasure a buried trove of gold and silver belonging to them. Their father had been a righteous man and so because of his righteousness they were protected both in terms of their souls and their possessions and your Lord desired that they should come of age that is He desired for them the attainment of maturity and extract their treasure as a mercy from your Lord rahmatan min rabbik is a direct object denoting reason operated by the verb arāda ‘He desired’. And I did not do it namely what has been mentioned of his making a hole in the ship the slaying of the boy and the repair of the wall of my own accord that is out of my own choosing; nay it was because of a command in the form of an inspiration from God. This is the interpretation of that over which you could not maintain patience’ one may say istā‘a or istatā‘a to mean ‘he had the capacity for something’; in this instance and the previous one both forms of the verb have been used. Moreover there is a variety of expression in the use of fa-aradtu ‘I desired’ fa-aradnā ‘We desired’ and fa-arāda rabbuk ‘Your Lord desired’."
  18,83,"And they the Jews question you concerning Dhū’l-Qarnayn whose name was Alexander; he was not a prophet. Say ‘I shall recite relate to you a mention an account of him’ of his affair."
