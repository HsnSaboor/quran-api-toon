And God is truly able to help them;"
  22,40,"they are those who were expelled from their homes without right for their expulsion; they were expelled only because they said that is because of their saying ‘Our Lord is God’ alone such a saying is ‘right’ and so then to be expelled for saying it is to be expelled without right. Were it not for God’s causing some people ba‘dahum ‘some’ substitutes for al-nāsa ‘people’ to drive back others destruction would have befallen read la-huddimat to emphasise a great number of destructions; or read la-hudimat the monasteries sawāmi‘ is for monks and churches kanā’is are for Christians and synagogues salawāt is the Hebrew term for Jewish houses of worship kanā’is and mosques masājid are for Muslims in which that is in which mentioned places God’s Name is mentioned greatly and with such destruction acts of worship cease. Assuredly God will help those who help Him that is who help His religion. God is truly Strong overpowering His creation Mighty Invincible in terms of His dominion and power;"

  22,44,"and the inhabitants of Midian the people of Shu‘ayb and Moses was also denied he was denied by the native Egyptians al-qibt and not by his people the Children of Israel.
