tafsir[8]{c,v,t}:
  57,4,"It is He Who created the heavens and the earth in six days of the days of this world the first of which being Sunday and the last of which Friday then presided upon the Throne ‘arsh denotes the kursī a presiding that was befitting of Him. He knows what enters the earth of rain and dead creatures and what issues from it of vegetation and minerals and what comes down from the heaven in the way of mercy and chastisement and what ascends in it of righteous deeds and evil ones. And He is with you by virtue of His knowledge wherever you may be; and God is Seer of what you do."
  57,5,"To Him belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and to Him all matters all existents are returned."
  57,6,"He makes the night pass into He makes it enter the day so that it increases while the night diminishes and makes the day pass into the night so that it increases while the day diminishes. And He is Knower of what is in the breasts of what it contains of secrets and convictions."
  57,7,"Believe adhere to belief in God and His Messenger and expend in the way of God out of that over which He has made you successors out of the wealth of those mentioned whom you have succeeded for you will be succeeded in this wealth by those who will come after you this was revealed at the time of the ‘hardship’ campaign the campaign of Tabūk. For those of you who believe and expend — an allusion to ‘Uthmān b. ‘Affān may God be pleased with him — will have a great reward."
  57,8,"And why should you not believe — an address to the disbelievers — in other words there is nothing to prevent you from believing in God when the Messenger is calling you to believe in your Lord and a pledge has been taken from you reading it as ukhidha mīthāqukum; otherwise akhadha mīthāqakum ‘He has taken a pledge from you’ concerning it — that is to say God took this pledge from you in the world of atoms when He made them bear witness against themselves ‘Am I not your Lord?’ They said ‘Yea indeed’ Q. 7172 — if you are believers? that is to say if your intention is to believe in Him then apply yourselves to this duty of faith."
  57,9,"It is He Who sends down upon His servant clear signs the signs of the Qur’ān that He may bring you forth from the darkness from disbelief to the light to faith. For truly God is Kind Merciful to you in bringing you forth from disbelief to faith."
  57,10,"And why should you after having embraced faith not allā the nūn of an an-lā has been assimilated here with the lām of lā expend in the way of God when to God belongs the heritage of the heavens and the earth with all that they comprise so that He will eventually receive all your wealth but without the reward for having expended of it for His cause as opposed to if you had expended and had hence been rewarded. Not equal to the rest of you are those of you who expended and fought before the victory at Mecca. Such are greater in rank than those who expended and fought afterwards. Yet to each of the two groups a variant reading for wa-kullan ‘yet to each’ has nominative wa-kullun as a subject God has promised the best reward Paradise. And God is Aware of what you do and will requite you for it accordingly."
  57,11,"Who is it that will lend God by expending his wealth in the way of God a goodly loan goodly by virtue of his expending it for God’s sake so that He may multiply it fa-yudā‘ifahu may also be read fa-yuda‘‘ifahu for him from tenfold up to more than seven hundredfold —as stated in sūrat al-Baqara Q. 2261 and so that there may be for him in addition to the multiplied reward a generous reward coupled with satisfaction and prosperity."
