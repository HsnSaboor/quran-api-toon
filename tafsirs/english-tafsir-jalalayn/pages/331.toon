tafsir[11]{c,v,t}:
  21,102,"They will not hear the faintest sound from it and they will abide in what their souls desired of bliss."
  21,103,"The Supreme Terror — which is that a servant be ordered off to the Fire shall not grieve them and the angels shall receive them upon their exiting from their graves saying to them ‘This is your day the one which you were promised’ during the life of the world."
  21,104,"The day yawma is in the accusative because of an implied preceding udhkur ‘mention’ when We shall roll up the heaven as the Scribe al-sijill being the name of an angel rolls up the written scroll that is the scroll of the son of Adam when he dies the lām of li’l-kitāb is extra; alternatively one may read the verse so that al-sijill is ‘the scroll’ and al-kitāb means al-maktūb ‘what is written’ in which case the lām of li’l-kitāb has the sense of the particle ‘alā ‘over’; a variant reading for li’l-kitāb has the plural li’l-kutub ‘the books’. As We began the first creation from non-existence We shall repeat it after making it non-existent the kāf of ka-mā ‘as’ is semantically connected to nu‘īdu ‘We shall repeat it’ and its suffixed pronoun -hu ‘it’ refers back to awwala ‘the first’; the mā relates to the verbal noun — a promise binding on Us wa‘dan is in the accusative because it is the direct object of an implied preceding wa‘adnā ‘We promised’ and the clause constitutes a confirmation of the import of the preceding verse 103. Truly We shall do that which We have promised."
  21,105,"Certainly We wrote in the Scripture al-zabūr means ‘the Book’ that is the revealed Books of God after the Remembrance meaning the Mother of the Book umm al-kitāb which is kept with God ‘Indeed the land the land of Paradise shall be inherited by My righteous servants’ — this promise applies to all righteous ones."
  21,106,"Indeed there is in this Qur’ān a proclamation sufficient means for securing entry into Paradise for a people who are devout acting in accordance with what is stipulated in it."
  21,107,"We did not send you O Muhammad (s) except as a mercy that is to give mercy to all the worlds the worlds of mankind and jinn through you."
  21,108,"Say ‘All that is being revealed to me is that your God is One God that is the only thing that is being revealed to me with respect to the Divine is His Oneness. So will you submit?’ will you accede to affirming the Oneness of the Divine that is being revealed to me? the interrogative is meant as an imperative."
  21,109,"But if they turn away from this say ‘I have proclaimed to you I have notified you of my declaration of war on you all alike ‘alā sawā’ is a circumstantial qualifier referring to both the subject of the verb and the object that is to say you are all equal in having knowledge of this I shall not proceed independently without having first informed you in order for you to make preparations although I do not know whether near or far is that which you have been promised’ with respect to chastisement or to the Day of Resurrection that comprises this chastisement; only God knows it."
  21,110,"Indeed He exalted be He knows whatever is spoken aloud and what you and others do and He knows what you conceal both you and others of secrets."
  21,111,"I do not know; perhaps that which I have notified you of but whose time is not known may be a trial a test for you to see how you will act and an enjoyment for a while that is until your terms of life are concluded this second clause wa-matā‘un ‘and an enjoyment’ counters the former which is the object of the optative expressed by the particle la‘alla ‘perhaps’; the second clause cannot be an optative."
  21,112,"Say qul a variant reading has qāla ‘He said’ ‘My Lord! Judge between me and my deniers with truth by assigning chastisement for them or victory for me over them. And so they were chastised at the battles of Badr Uhud Hunayn al-Ahzāb and al-Khandaq and he the Prophet was given victory over them. And our Lord is the Compassionate One Whose help is to be sought against what you allege’ when you invent lies against God saying that ‘God has taken a son’ cf. Q. 2116; and against me when you say ‘he is a sorcerer’ cf. Q. 384 or against the Qur’ān when you say ‘it is poetry’ cf. Q. 5230."
