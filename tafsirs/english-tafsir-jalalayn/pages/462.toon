tafsir[9]{c,v,t}:
  39,32,"So who is — in other words none is — a greater wrongdoer than he who imputes falsehood to God by ascribing partners and child to Him and who denies the truth namely the Qur’ān when it reaches him? Is there not a fitting abode in Hell for the disbelievers? Indeed there is."
  39,33,"And he who brings the truth — and that is the Prophet s — and those who confirm it namely the believers here alladhī ‘he who’ has the significance of alladhīna ‘those who’ those they are the ones who guard themselves against idolatry."
  39,34,"They shall have whatever they wish with their Lord. That is the reward of those who are virtuous to their own souls through their acceptance of faith;"
  39,35,"so that God may absolve them of the worst of what they did and pay them their reward by the best of what they used to do aswa’a and ahsana mean simply al-sayyi’ ‘bad’ and al-hasan ‘good’."
  39,36,"Does God not suffice as defender of His servant? the Prophet? Indeed He does. Yet they would frighten you — the address is for him s — of those besides Him namely the idols by telling him that these idols might kill him or render him insane. And whomever God leads astray for him there is no guide."
  39,37,"But whomever God guides there is no one able to lead him astray. Is not God Mighty One Whose way always prevails a Lord of Retribution? against His enemies? Indeed He is."
  39,38,"And if wa-la-in the lām is for oaths you ask them ‘Who created the heavens and the earth?’ they will surely say ‘God.’ Say ‘Have you considered then those on whom you call those whom you worship besides God namely the idols if God should desire some harm to befall me would they be able to remove the harm imposed by Him? No! Or if He should desire some mercy for me would they be able to withhold His mercy?’ No! a variant reading for the two clauses kāshifātun durrahu and mumsikātun rahmatahu has the genitive construction kāshifātu durrihi and mumsikātu rahmatihi. Say ‘God is sufficient for me. In Him do all the trusting put their trust’."
  39,39,"Say ‘O my people! Act according to your situation according to your circumstances I too am acting according to my circumstances. For you will come to know"
  39,40,"to whom man introduces the relative clause that is the direct object of the action of ‘knowing’ will come a chastisement that will disgrace him and on whom there will descend a lasting chastisement’ an everlasting one namely the chastisement of the Fire. Indeed God then disgraced them at Badr."
