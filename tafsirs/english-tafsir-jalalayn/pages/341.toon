tafsir[6]{c,v,t}:
  22,73,"O mankind that is to say O people of Mecca a similitude is being struck so listen to it and it is that truly those on whom you call whom you worship besides God that is other than Him and these are the idols will never create a fly dhubāb is a generic noun the singular of which is dhubāba for both the masculine and the feminine even if they rallied together to do so to create it. And if a fly should take away something from them such as a drop of the scents or the saffron in which they drench themselves they would not be able to recover that from it because of their complete incapacity so how can they worship those whom they suppose to be partners of God exalted be He? An odd thing — which He has expressed by striking a similitude. Feeble is the seeker the worshipper and the thing sought the thing worshipped!"
  22,74,"They do not esteem God exalt Him with the esteem He deserves with the exaltedness He deserves for they ascribe to Him partners who can neither protect themselves from a fly nor retaliate against it. Truly God is Strong Mighty Victor."
  22,75,"God chooses from the angels messengers and also chooses from mankind messengers — this was revealed after the idolaters said Has the Remembrance been revealed to him out of all of us? Q. 388. Truly God is Hearer of what they say Seer of those whom He chooses as messengers such as Gabriel Michael Abraham Muhammad (s) and others may God bless them and grant them peace."
  22,76,"He knows that which is before them and that which is behind them in other words what they have offered in the way of deeds and what they have left behind and what they have done and what they will do next; and to God all matters are returned."
  22,77,"O you who believe bow down and prostrate yourselves in other words perform prayer and worship your Lord affirm His Oneness and do good such as showing kindness to kin and the adoption of noble traits that perhaps you may be prosperous that perhaps you may secure everlasting life in Paradise."
  22,78,"And struggle in the way of God in order to establish His religion a struggle worthy of Him by expending all effort therein haqqa is in the accusative because it is a verbal noun. He has elected you He has chosen you for His religion and has not laid upon you in your religion any hardship that is any constraint for He has facilitated adherence to it during times of difficulty such as His permitting you to shorten prayers to seek ritual purification from earth to eat of carrion and to break the fast during illness or travel — the creed of your father millata is in the accusative because the genitive preposition kāf sc. ka-millati ‘like the creed of’ has been omitted Abraham Ibrāhīma an explicative supplement. He that is God named you Muslims before that is before the revelation of this Book and in this that is in the Qur’ān so that the Messenger might be a witness against you on the Day of Resurrection that he delivered the Message to you and that you might be witnesses against mankind that their messengers delivered the Message to them. So maintain prayer observe it regularly and pay the alms and hold fast to God trust in Him. He is your Patron your Helper and the Guardian of your affairs. An excellent Patron is He and an excellent Helper for you."
