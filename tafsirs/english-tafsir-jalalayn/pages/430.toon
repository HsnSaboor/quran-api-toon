  34,15,"Verily there was for Sheba Saba’ declined as li-Saba’in or left as indeclinable li-Saba’a is the name of a tribe that took its name from one of their Arab ancestors in their dwelling-place in Yemen a sign indicating God’s power exalted be He two gardens jannatān a substitution for āyatun ‘a sign’ to the right and to the left in other words on the right side of their valley and on its left side. And it was said to them ‘Eat of your Lord’s provision and give thanks to Him for the graces He has bestowed on you in the land of Sheba. A good land — in which there was no dung gnats flies fleas scorpions or snakes and in which when a stranger passed through with his clothes lice-infected these lice would be killed off because of the purity of its air — and God is a forgiving Lord.’"
  34,16,"But they were disregardful of giving thanks to Him and became disbelievers so We unleashed upon them the flood of the Dam al-‘arim is the plural of ‘arima which is a structure or something similar that holds water back to be stored for when it is needed in other words We unleashed upon them the flood-waters of their valley which had been held back by the mentioned structure so that they engulfed their two gardens together with all their property. And We gave them in place of their two gardens two gardens bearing dhawātay a dual form of feminine plural dhawāt; usually the form dhātay from the singular would have been used bitter fruit bitter and vile ukul may be read as a genitive annexation ukulin khamtin in the sense of ‘that which is eaten thereof being bitter; or it may be read without as ukuli khamtin; and this phrase is supplemented by the following wa-athlin wa-shay’in min sidrin qalīl and tamarisk and sparse lote trees."
  34,17,"That replacement of what they had is what We requited them with for their ingratitude and is anyone but the ingrate ever so requited? read hal yujāzā illā’l-kafūru; or read as hal nujāzī illā’l-kafūra ‘Would We requite anyone but the ingrate?’ in other words it is only the like of such who is called to account."
  34,18,"And We set between them between Sheba who were in Yemen and the towns which We had blessed with abundance of water and trees — these being the towns of Syria to which they used to travel for commerce — prominent towns continuous along the route from Yemen to Syria and We facilitated for travellers the journeying through them such that they would rest for the afternoon in one and spend the night in the next and so on until the end of their travel having no need of any supplies or water along the way; and We said ‘Travel through them night and day safely’ having no fear by night or by day."
  34,19,"But they said ‘Our Lord make far apart ba‘‘id a variant reading has bā‘id the stages of our travel’ to Syria make these stages through deserts so that they could glory before the poor in riding their camels and bearing their supplies and water and so they behaved wantonly with the graces bestowed on them by God and they wronged their souls through disbelief and so We made them bywords of wrongdoing in this respect for those who came after them and We caused them to disintegrate totally We scattered them all over the lands. Surely in that which is mentioned there are signs lessons for every servant who is steadfast in refraining from acts of disobedience grateful for God’s graces."
  34,20,"And verily Iblīs proved true read sadaqa or saddaqa his opinion of them that is of the disbelievers among them — the folk of Sheba — which was that by his tempting them to go astray they would follow him. So they followed him if the verb above is read sadaqa this would mean that ‘he was right in his opinion’ and if read saddaqa it would mean that ‘he found this opinion of his to be true’ — all except a group of the believers mina’l-mu’minīna the min ‘of’ is explicative not partitive in other words all except that group who were the believers they did not follow him."
  34,21,"And he did not have any warrant over them any power to sway them from Us but that We might know by this knowledge being made manifest him who believed in the Hereafter from him who was in doubt thereof and so requite each of the two accordingly. And your Lord is Preserver Watcher of all things."
  34,22,"Say O Muhammad (s) to the disbelievers of Mecca ‘Call on those whom you have asserted those whom you have asserted to be gods besides God in other words other than Him so that they might benefit you as you are wont to assert. God exalted be He says of them They do not possess even so much as the weight of an atom of good or evil in the heavens or in the earth and they do not have any share in either of them nor has He exalted be He among them the gods any auxiliary’ anyone required as His helper."
