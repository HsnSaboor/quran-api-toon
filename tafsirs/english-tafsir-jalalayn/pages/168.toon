  7,144,"He God said to him ‘O Moses I have elected you chosen you from among mankind the people of your time for My Messages read plural bi-risālātī or singular bi-risālatī ‘for My Message’ and My Speech that is for My having spoken to you. So take what I have given you of bounty and be of the thankful’ of My favours."
  7,145,"And We inscribed for him in the Tablets that is the Tablets of the Torah — these were made from the Lote-tree of Paradise or of chrysolite or emerald and they were either seven or ten — about all things one needs in religion as an admonition and a detailing an explanation of all things li-kulli shay’in substitutes for the previous genitive construction min kulli shay’ ‘about all things’. ‘Take it then there is an implicit qulnā ‘We said’ before this fa-kudhhā ‘take it then’ firmly seriously and earnestly and enjoin your people to adhere to the fairest precepts in it. I shall show you the abode of the wicked of Pharaoh and his followers and that is Egypt that you may take an example from them."
  7,146,"I shall turn away from My signs the proofs of My power in the way of creations and otherwise those who behave arrogantly in the earth without right by humiliating them so that they do not magnify themselves; and if they see every sign do not believe in it and if they see the way the path of rectitude the guidance that has come from God do not adopt it as a way to follow and if they see the way of error misguidance adopt it as a way. That turning of them away is because they have denied Our signs and were heedless of them. A similar statement has been made above."
  7,147,"Those who deny Our signs and the encounter in the Hereafter the Resurrection and so on. their works the good deeds they performed in the world such as the maintenance of kinship ties or voluntary almsgivings have failed are invalid and will not be rewarded since they are not binding in this case. Shall they they shall not be requited anything but the requital for what they used to do?’ in the way of denial and acts of disobedience?"
  7,148,"And the people of Moses after him that is after he had departed for the communion with God made of their ornaments which they had borrowed from Pharaoh’s folk on the pretext of a wedding celebration and which remained in their possession a calf which the Samaritan had fashioned for them therefrom; a mere living body jasadan is a substitution for ‘ijlan ‘a calf’ of flesh and blood which lowed that is which made audible sounds like a cow it the calf was transformed in this way when the dust which he the Samaritan had collected from where the hoof of Gabriel’s steed had trodden was placed in its mouth for it has the effect of giving life to that in which it is placed the second direct object of the verb ittakhadha ‘they made’ has been omitted but it would be ilāhan ‘as a god’. Did they not see that it spoke not to them nor guided them to any way? so how can it be taken as a god? Yet they took it as such a god and were evildoers for taking it so."
  7,149,"And when they became at a loss that is when they became remorseful for having worshipped it and saw and realised that they had gone astray thereby and this was after Moses’s return from the communion they said ‘Unless our Lord is merciful to us and forgives us read both verbs either in the third person singular or in the second person singular verily we shall be among the losers’."
