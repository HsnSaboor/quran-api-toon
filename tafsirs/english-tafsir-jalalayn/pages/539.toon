  57,12,"Mention the day when you will see the believing men and believing women with their light shining forth before them in front of them and it will also be on their right and it will be said to them ‘Good tidings for you on this day Gardens that is to say enter them underneath which rivers flow wherein you will abide. That is the great success’."
  57,13,"The day when the hypocrites men and women will say to those who believe ‘Look at us unzurūnā a variant reading has anzirūnā meaning ‘Give us a chance’ that we may glean something of your light!’ It will be said to them in mockery of them ‘Step back and seek light!’ So they step back then there will be set up between them and the believers a wall — this is said to be the wall of ‘the Heights’ cf. Q. 746 — with a gate the inner side of which contains mercy the side of the believers and the outer side of which the side of the hypocrites faces toward the chastisement."
  57,14,"They will call out to them ‘Did we not use to be with you?’ upon the path of obedience. They will say ‘Yes indeed! But you caused your souls to fall into temptation by engaging in hypocrisy and you awaited reversals of fortune for the believers and you doubted you were uncertain about the religion of Islam and false hopes greedy desires deceived you until God’s ordinance death came; and the Deceiver Satan deceived you concerning God."
  57,15,"So on this day no ransom will be taken from you read tu’khadhu or yu’khadhu nor from those who disbelieved. Your abode will be the Fire it will be your guardian it is the place truly deserving of you and an evil destination!’ it is."
  57,16,"Is it not time for those who believe — this was revealed concerning the matter of the Companions of the Prophet who had been overindulging in jest that their hearts should be humbled to the remembrance of God and to what has been revealed read as nuzzila; or read nazala ‘what has come down’ of the truth the Qur’ān and that they should not be lā yakūnū is a supplement to takhsha‘a ‘be humbled’ like those who were given the Scripture before? namely the Jews and the Christians. For the stretch of time the interval extending from them back to the time of the sending of the last of their prophets was too long for them and so their hearts became hardened unyielding to the remembrance of God and many of them are immoral."
  57,17,"Know — an address to the believers just mentioned — that God revives the earth after its death by bringing forth vegetation and likewise He is able to do with your hearts restoring them to humbleness. We have certainly made clear for you the signs that testify to Our power with this mentioned example and others that perhaps you may understand."
  57,18,"Indeed men who give voluntary alms al-mussaddiqīna derives from the infinitive al-tasadduq ‘to give voluntary alms’; the tā’ of the original mutasaddiqīna has been assimilated with the sād and women who give voluntary alms a variant reading for both has the softened form with a single sād musaddiqīna and musaddiqāti which derives from al-tasdīq ‘to affirm the truth of’ ‘to believe in’ and those of them who have lent God a goodly loan this refers back to both the men and women with the masculine plural of predominance; the supplementing of a verb aqradū ‘who lent’ to a noun of action al-mussaddiqāt at the point of the relative clause of the al- is because in that position it the noun functions as a verb; the mention of the ‘loan’ together with its qualification ‘goodly’ after the mention of ‘the giving of voluntary alms’ is intended to define it it will be multiplied yudā‘afu is also read as yuda‘‘afu namely their loan will multiplied for them and they will have a generous reward."
