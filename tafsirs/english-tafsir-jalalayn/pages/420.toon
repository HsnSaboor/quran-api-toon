  33,16,"Say ‘Flight will not avail you should you flee from death or from being slain and then if you were to flee you would not be extended comfort in this world after you have fled except a little’ except for the remainder of your terms of life."
  33,17,"Say ‘Who is it that can protect you grant you sanctuary from God should He desire to cause you ill whether it be destruction or defeat or who is it that can cause you ill should He God desire for you mercy?’ good. And they shall not find for themselves besides God in other words other than God any protector to avail them or helper to ward off harm from them."
  33,18,"Indeed God already knows the hinderers among you and those who say to their brethren ‘Come to us’ and they do not engage in the battle except a little for show and for the sake of their reputation"
  33,19,"grudging to you in their help ashihha ‘grudging’ is the plural of shahīh and is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the subject of the verb ya’tūna ‘they engage’. And when there is a panic you see them looking at you their eyes rolling like one that is like the look of one or the rolling of one fainting at death in other words one in the throes thereof; but when the panic subsides and the spoils have been secured they scald you they hurt you or they smite you with their sharp tongues in their greed for the riches in other words for the spoils which they demand greedily. Those they never believed really. Therefore God has invalidated their works and that invalidation is easy for God by His will."
  33,20,"They suppose that the confederates of disbelievers have not yet departed to Mecca because of their fear of them and were the confederates to come a second time they would wish that they were in the desert with the Bedouins asking about your news your encounters with the disbelievers. And if they were among you this second time they would fight but a little for show and for fear of being reviled."
  33,21,"Verily there is for you a good example read iswa or uswa in the Messenger of God to emulate in combat and in holding one’s ground therein for whoever li-man substitutes for lakum ‘for you’ hopes for the encounter with God fears Him and the Last Day and remembers God often in contrast to those who do not."
  33,22,"And when the believers saw the confederates of disbelievers they said ‘This is what God and His Messenger promised us in the way of trial and assistance to victory and God and His Messenger were truthful’ about the promise. And that only increased them in faith in belief in God’s promise and submission to His command."
