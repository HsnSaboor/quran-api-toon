  28,6,"and to establish them in the land the land of Egypt and Syria and to show Pharaoh and Hāmān and their hosts a variant reading has wa-yarā Fir‘awnu wa-Hāmānu wa-junūduhumā ‘so that Pharaoh and Hāmān and their hosts might see’ with all three nouns in the nominative from them that of which they were apprehensive that which they feared of the new-born Israelite who would bring about the end of their kingdom."
  28,7,"And We revealed by inspiration or in a dream to the mother of Moses — who was the said new-born; his sister was the only other person aware of his birth — ‘Suckle him then when you fear for him cast him into the waters namely the Nile and do not fear that he should drown or grieve for being separated from him for We will restore him to you and make him one of the messengers’. She suckled him for three months during which he never cried. She then began to fear for him and so she placed him in a basket coated with pitch and made as a cradle for him on the inside. She then closed it and cast it into the waters of the Nile at night."
  28,8,"Then Pharaoh’s folk aids picked him up with him still in the basket the morning following that night — it was placed him in front of him Pharaoh and then opened and Moses was brought out of it sucking milk from his thumb — to be at the end of the affair an enemy slaying their menfolk and a cause of grief to them enslaving their womenfolk a variant reading for hazanan is huznan both of which are alternative forms of the verbal noun and it functions as an active participle derived from hazanahu which is like ahzanahu ‘he caused him grief’. Truly Pharaoh and his minister Hāmān and their hosts were sinners that is disobedient and so they were punished at his Moses’s hands."
  28,9,"And Pharaoh’s wife said after he and his aids had resolved to slay him he is ‘A joyous sight for me and you. Do not slay him. Perhaps he will be of benefit to us or we will adopt him as a son’ and so they obeyed her wish. And they were not aware of the sequel to their affair with him."
  28,10,"And the heart of Moses’s mother when she found out that they had picked him up became empty of everything other than him. Indeed in softened from the hardened form its subject omitted in other words understand it as innaha she was about to expose him that is as being her son had We not fortified her heart with patience that is We made it at peace that she might be of the believers of those who have faith in God’s promise the response to the conditional lawlā ‘had … not’ is given by the preceding statement."
  28,11,"And she said to his sister Mary ‘Follow him’ in other words follow where he goes in order to find out his news. So she watched him from afar from a distance secretly while they were not aware that she was his sister or that she was even watching him."
  28,12,"And We had forbidden him to take to the breasts of fostermothers from before that is to say we prevented him from taking to the breasts of any suckling mother other than his own mother. Therefore he would not accept the breasts of any of the foster-mothers brought for him. So she his sister said ‘Shall I show you a household — having seen their affection for him — who will take care of him for you by having him suckled and so on and who will act in good faith towards him?’ the suffixed pronoun in lahu has been interpreted as referring to the king as a response to them when they asked Mary how she could be sure. Her suggestion was accepted. So she brought his mother and he took to her breast. She explained to them that he had taken to her breast because of her pleasant scent and the wholesome taste of her milk. Permission was given to her to breast-feed him in her own house and so she returned with him just as God exalted be He says"
  28,13,"Thus We restored him to his mother so that her eyes might delight in seeing him again and not grieve thereat and that she might know that God’s promise to restore him to her is true; but most of them that is the people do not know about this promise or of the fact that this was his sister and the other was his mother. He Moses remained with her until he was weaned during which time she was paid wages at one dinar per day. She took this because it was money from enemy territory harbī. She then brought him back to Pharaoh in whose household he was raised as God recounts of him in sūrat al-Shu‘arā’ Q. 2618 Did we not rear you among us as a child and did you not stay with us for years of your life?"
