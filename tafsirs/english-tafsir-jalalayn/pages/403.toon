  29,61,"And if wa-la-in the lām is for oaths you were to ask them namely the disbelievers ‘Who created the heavens and the earth and disposed the sun and the moon?’ They would assuredly say ‘God.’ So how then are they turned away? from affirming His Oneness after affirming that God created them."
  29,62,"God extends provision He makes it abundant for whomever He will of His servants by way of a test and He straitens He restricts it for him after having extended it that is for whomever He will to try.
