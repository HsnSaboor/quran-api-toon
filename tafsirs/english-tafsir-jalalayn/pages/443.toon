  36,41,"And a sign for them of Our power is that We carried their seed dhurriyatahum a variant reading has dhurriyyātihim that is to say their original ancestors in the laden Ark that is Noah’s fully-loaded ship"
  36,42,"and We have created for them the like of it that is the like of Noah’s Ark namely the small and large ships resembling it which they have made by the instruction of God exalted be He in which they ride."
  36,43,"And if We will We drown them despite the existence of ships for them to ride safely in whereat they have no one to call to none to succour them nor are they rescued delivered —"
  36,44,"except by a mercy from Us and for an enjoyment until some time in other words they can only be saved by Our showing them mercy and Our permitting them to enjoy those pleasures of theirs until their terms of life are concluded."
  36,45,"And when it is said to them ‘Beware of that which is before you of the chastisement of this world as it is said to others and that which is behind you of the chastisement of the Hereafter that perhaps you might find mercy’ they turn away in aversion."
  36,46,"And never did a sign of the signs of their Lord come to them but that they turned away from it."
  36,47,"And when it is said that is when the poor ones from among the Companions of the Prophet say to them ‘Expend on us of what God has provided you’ of wealth those who disbelieve say to those who believe in mockery of them ‘Are we to feed those whom if God willed He would feed? as you are wont to believe? You in saying this to us together with this believe of yours are only in manifest error!’ — as an explicit declaration of their disbelief this statement is very effective in the way that it has been expressed."
  36,48,"And they say ‘When will this promise of resurrection be fulfilled if you are being truthful?’ therein."
  36,49,"God exalted be He says They await but a single Cry namely the cry of Isrāfīl’s First Blast that will seize them while they are disputing read yakhassimūna which is actually yakhtasimūna where the vowel of the tā’ has been moved to the khā’ and it the tā’ has been assimilated with the sād in other words while they are oblivious to it busily engaged in disputes concluding bargains eating and drinking and so on; a variant reading has yakhsimūna similar in pattern to yadribūna in which case the meaning is while they dispute with one another."
  36,50,"Then they will not be able to make any testament that is to make a bequest nor will they return to their folk from their markets and their businesses rather they will die then and there."
  36,51,"And the Trumpet is blown — this is the Horn — at the second Blast for the Resurrection to take place; between the two Blasts is an interval of forty years; and lo! they those interred will be scrambling out of their graves towards their Lord emerging therefrom hurriedly."
  36,52,"They the disbelievers among them will say ‘O yā is for calling attention to something woe to us! waylanā means halākanā ‘O our destruction!’ and it is a verbal noun which has no regular verbal conjugation Who has raised us from our place of sleep? they say this because they will have been asleep in the interval between the two blasts and will not have been punished yet. This that is this raising is that which the Compassionate One had promised and regarding which the messengers had spoken the truth’ they affirm this truth when such affirmation is no longer of any benefit to them — but it is also said that this is said to them."
  36,53,"It is but a single Cry and behold they will all be arraigned before Us!"
  36,54,"So today no soul shall be wronged in any way and you shall not be requited except the requital of what you used to do."
