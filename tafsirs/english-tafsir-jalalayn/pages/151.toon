tafsir[11]{c,v,t}:
  7,1,"Alif Lām Mīm Sād God knows best what He means by these letters."
  7,2,"This is a Book that is revealed to you — addressing the Prophet s — so let there be no inhibition no constraint in your breast because of it to convey it — for fear that you might be called a liar — that you may warn thereby li-tundhira ‘that you may warn’ is semantically connected to unzila ‘is revealed’ that is to say ‘it is revealed for the purposes of warning’ and as a reminder for those who believe in it."
  7,3,"Say to them Follow what has been revealed to you from your Lord namely the Qur’ān and do not follow do not take beside Him namely God in other words other than Him any patrons obeying them in disobedience of Him exalted be He. Little do you remember read tadhakkarūn or yadhakkarūn ‘little are you or they admonished’; the original tā’ of tatadhakkarūn has been assimilated with the dhāl; a variant reading has tadhkurūn; the mā of qalīlan mā ‘little’ is extra merely emphasising the ‘littleness’."
  7,4,"How many kam is predicative and is the direct object of the main verb ahlaknāhā ‘We have destroyed’ a city meaning its inhabitants have We destroyed have We willed its destruction! So Our might Our chastisement came upon it at night or while they slept at noon qā’ilūn al-qaylūla is a rest taken halfway during the day even if it does not involve sleep in other words sometimes it came upon it at night and sometimes it came during the day."
  7,5,"And their only plea their only words when Our might came upon them was to say ‘We were evildoers indeed’."
  7,6,"Then verily We shall question those to whom the Message was sent that is We shall question those communities about their response to the messengers and to what extent they implemented that which was conveyed to them; and We shall question the messengers about the conveying of that Message."
  7,7,"And We shall narrate to them with knowledge We shall inform them with previous knowledge of what they did; for verily We were not absent when the messengers were conveying the Message nor were We absent during the time of bygone communities and what they did."
  7,8,"The weighing of deeds or of the scrolls of these deeds shall be — in a balance that has a tongue and two palms as scales as reported in a hadīth — on that day that is on the day of the questioning mentioned namely the Day of Resurrection the true weighing the fair weighing al-haqq ‘the true’ is an adjectival qualification of al-wazn ‘the weighing’. As for those whose scales are heavy with good deeds they are the successful the triumphant."
  7,9,"And as for those whose scales are light because of evil deeds those are the ones who have lost their souls by causing them to travel towards the Fire because they mistreated they knowingly denied Our signs."
  7,10,"And We have given you power O Children of Adam in the earth and have appointed for you therein livelihoods ma‘āyish is the plural of ma‘īsha that is the means by which you are able to subsist; little qalīlan mā mā is to emphasise the ‘littleness’ thanks you show for this."
  7,11,"And We created you that is your father Adam then shaped you that is We shaped him with you deposited in his back then said to the angels ‘Prostrate yourselves before Adam!’ a prostration that is a bow of salutation. So they fell prostrate all save Iblīs the father of the jinn who was among the angels — he was not of those who make prostration."
