tafsir[6]{c,v,t}:
  35,39,"It is He Who made you successors in the earth khalā’if ‘successors’ is the plural of khalīfa in other words one succeeding the other. So whoever disbelieves of you his disbelief will be to his own detriment that is the evil consequences of his disbelief will be so. And their disbelief does not increase the disbelievers with their Lord in anything except disfavour wrath. And their disbelief does not increase the disbelievers in anything except loss of the reward of the Hereafter."
  35,40,"Say ‘Have you considered your associates on whom you call those whom you worship besides God? in other words other than God — and they are the idols whom you asserted to be partners of God exalted be He. Show me apprise me of what part of the earth they have created. Or do they have some partnership some share alongside God in the creation of the heavens?’ Or have We given them a scripture so that they are acting upon a clear proof a definitive argument therefrom? to the effect that they have some partnership with Me? Nothing of the sort! Nay but the evildoers the disbelievers promise one another nothing but delusion falsehood when they say that the idols will intercede for them."
  35,41,"Truly God sustains the heavens and the earth lest they disappear in other words He prevents them from disappearing. And if wa-la-in the lām is for oaths they were to disappear there is none that can sustain them after Him in other words other than Him. Truly He is ever Forbearing Forgiving in deferring the punishment of the disbelievers."
  35,42,"And they that is the disbelievers of Mecca swore by God their most solemn oaths they swore with utmost effort to be sincere in them that if a warner a messenger were to come to them they would be more readily guided than any one of the communities than the Jews the Christians or others in other words more readily guided than any one of these — having themselves seen the extent to which these groups called each other liars given that The Jews say ‘The Christians stand on nothing’ and the Christians say ‘The Jews stand on nothing’ Q. 2113. But when a warner namely Muhammad (s) did come to them this coming of his only increased them in aversion further away from right guidance"
  35,43,"acting with disdain in the land against faith istikbāran fī’l-ardi an object denoting reason and devising acts of evil in the way of idolatry and otherwise; and evil schemes will beset surround only their authors namely the one who devises such evil the qualifying of makr ‘scheme’ with the noun al-sayyi’ ‘evil’ is intrinsic to the fact that it is a scheme and so the annexation of the former to the latter is said to be alternative usage in which the annexed term is implied as a precaution against annexing a noun to an adjective. So do they expect do they await anything but the precedent of the ancients? God’s way of dealing with them such as chastising them for their denial of the messengers? Yet you will never find any change in God’s precedent and you will never find any revision in God’s precedent that is to say chastisement is never replaced by anything else nor is it ever meted out other than to the one who deserves it."
  35,44,"Have they not travelled in the land and seen the nature of the consequence for those who were before them — and they were mightier than these in power? but still God destroyed them for their denial of the messengers. And God is not such that anything in the heavens or in the earth can escape Him pre-empt Him or elude Him. Truly He is ever Knower of all things Omnipotent."
