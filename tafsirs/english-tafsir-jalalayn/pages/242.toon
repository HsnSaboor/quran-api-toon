tafsir[11]{c,v,t}:
  12,53,"Yet I do not exculpate my own soul of slipping into error; verily the soul as such is ever inciting to evil except that whereon meaning the person upon whom my Lord has mercy and so protects from sin. Truly my Lord is Forgiving Merciful’."
  12,54,"And the king said ‘Bring him to me that I may use him for myself’ that I may make him mine exclusively with none to share him with me. The messenger came to him to Joseph and said ‘Respond to the king!’ and so he got up and bid farewell to his fellow-prisoners and prayed for them. He then washed himself put on some good clothes and entered upon him. And when he had spoken with him he said to him ‘Indeed you are on this day in our presence established and trustworthy’ a person of status entrusted over our affair so what do you think we should do? He said ‘Gather food stocks and sow abundantly in these fertile years then store the corn in its ears. People from far and wide will come to you and ask you to supply them with provisions’. He the king said ‘Whom can I delegate this task to?’"
  12,55,"He Joseph said ‘Place me in charge of the storehouses of the land the land of Egypt. I am indeed a skilled custodian’ one worthy of custodianship thereof and knowledgeable in such affairs — it is also said that he meant I am indeed a competent scribe and accountant."
  12,56,"Thus in the same way that We were graceful towards Him by delivering him from prison We established Joseph in the land the land of Egypt that he may settle in it wherever he wished after having suffered hardship and imprisonment. According to the story the king crowned him gave him a signet-ring to wear and appointed him in place of the Court officer whom he removed from his position and who later died; and so he the king made him Joseph take the latter’s spouse as a wife. He Joseph discovered that she was still a virgin and she bore him two children. He Joseph established justice in Egypt and people became subject to him. We confer Our mercy on whomever We will and We do not waste the wage of the virtuous."
  12,57,"Yet the wage of the Hereafter is better than the wage of this world for those who believe and are God-fearing. And so the years of drought arrived and afflicted the land of Canaan and Syria."
  12,58,"And Joseph’s brothers came — except for Benjamin — in order to secure provisions when they found out that the new Court officer of Egypt was providing food at its fair price; and they entered to him and he recognised them to be his brothers but they did not recognise him not knowing who he was because it had been a long time since they had seen him and because they supposed that he had died. They spoke to him in Hebrew and he said to them as if reproaching them ‘What brings you to my land?’ They replied ‘We have come for supplies’. He said ‘You might be spies!’ They said ‘God forbid!’ He said ‘So where are you from?’ They said ‘From the land of Canaan our father is Jacob the prophet of God.’ He said ‘Does he have children other than you?’ They said ‘Yes. We used to be twelve but the youngest of us passed away he perished in the wild. He was the most beloved to him our father from among us; only his full brother remains and so he keeps him by his side in order to comfort himself with him in place of the other.’ He Joseph commanded that they be given lodging and treated well."
  12,59,"And when he had equipped them with their provision when he had given them the full measure of food he said ‘Bring me a brother of yours from your father namely Benjamin that I might know that you have been truthful in what you said. Do you not see that I give the full measure that I complete it without any fraud and that I am the best of hosts?"
  12,60,"But if you do not bring him to me there will be no measure that is no provisions for you with me; and do not come near me’ wa-lā taqrabūn is either a prohibition or a supplement to the syntactical locus of fa-lā kayla in other words ‘and you shall be denied the measure and will not be allowed to come near me’."
  12,61,"They said ‘We will try to tempt his father away from him that is we will try our hardest to seek him from him. That we will surely do’."
  12,62,"And he said to his young men li-fityatihi a variant reading has li-fityānihi ‘his servants’ ‘Place their merchandise that money with which they bought the supplies and these were a few dirhams in their saddlebags their supply sacks so that they may recognise it when they return to their folk and empty their sacks and so come back’ to us deeming it unlawful to retain these monies."
  12,63,"So when they went back to their father they said ‘O father the measure will be denied us unless you send forth our brother to him to the Court officer; so send forth our brother with us that we may obtain the measure read naktal or yaktal ‘that he may obtain the measure for us’. Surely we will guard him well’."
