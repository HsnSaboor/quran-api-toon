tafsir[10]{c,v,t}:
  38,17,"God exalted be He says Bear patiently what they say and remember Our servant David the one of fortitude that is to say the one of fortitude in worship he used to fast every other day and keep vigil for half the night sleep for a third and then keep vigil for the last sixth. Indeed he was a penitent soul always returning to what pleases God."
  38,18,"Truly We disposed the mountains to glorify God with him with the same glorification at evening at the time of the night prayer and at sunrise at the time of the morning prayer which is when the sun has fully risen with its light extending everywhere."
  38,19,"And We disposed the birds mustered in flocks gathered before him glorifying with him; each of the mountains and birds turning to him reverting to obedience of him by glorifying God with him."
  38,20,"And We strengthened his Kingdom We reinforced it with guards and hosts every night there thirty thousand men would be standing guard at his sanctuary; and gave him wisdom prophethood and sound judgement in all matters and decisive speech the ability to formulate a satisfactory statement for a decision in any endeavour."
  38,21,"And has there come to you O Muhammad (s) the purpose of the interrogative indicated by hal here is to provoke curiosity and a desire to listen to what will follow the tale of the disputants when they scaled the sanctuary? David’s sanctuary that is his place of prayer for they had been prohibited from entering by the front gates because of his being engaged in worship in other words has it come to you their tale and their account?"
  38,22,"When they entered upon David and he was frightened by them. And they said ‘Do not fear; we are two disputants some say that this means ‘two groups’ in order to agree with the plural person of the verb dakhalū ‘they entered’; others say ‘two individuals’ with the plural person actually denoting these two; al-khasm may refer to a one or more individuals. These two were angels who had come in the form of two disputants between whom there was supposed to have occurred the situation mentioned — but only hypothetically — in order to alert David peace be upon him to what he had done he had ninety nine women but desired the woman of a man who had only her and no other. He David had married her and consummated the marriage. One of us has infringed upon the rights of the other so judge justly between us and do not transgress do not be unjust and guide us direct us to the right path’ the correct way."
  38,23,"‘Behold this brother of mine in other words my fellow co-religionist has ninety-nine ewes — here used to represent the women — while I have a single ewe; yet he said “Entrust it to me” in other words make me in charge of it and he overcame me in speech’ in other words in the argument; so the latter conceded charge of it to him."
  38,24,"He said ‘He has certainly wronged you by asking for your ewe that he may add it to his sheep. And indeed many associates infringe upon the rights of one another except such as believe and perform righteous deeds but few are they!’ mā emphasises the ‘fewness’. As the two angels were ascending to the heaven one said to the other ‘He has certainly passed judgement on himself!’ David was thus alerted to his deed. God exalted be He says And David thought in other words he became certain that We had indeed tried him that We had caused him to fall into a trial that is a test through his love for that woman. So he sought forgiveness of his Lord and fell down bowing in other words prostrate and repented."
  38,25,"So We forgave him that and indeed he has a station of nearness with Us that is even more good things in this world and a fair return in the Hereafter."
  38,26,"‘O David! We have indeed made you a vicegerent on the earth managing the affairs of people; so judge justly between people and do not follow desire that is the desires of the soul that it then lead you astray from the way of God that is to say from the proofs that indicate the truth of His Oneness. Truly those who go astray from the way of God in other words from belief in God — for them there will be a severe chastisement because of their forgetting the Day of Reckoning’ as a result of their having neglected faith. For had they been certain of the truth of the Day of Reckoning they would have first been believers in this world."
