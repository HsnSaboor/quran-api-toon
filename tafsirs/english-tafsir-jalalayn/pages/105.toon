tafsir[5]{c,v,t}:
  4,171,"O People of the Scripture the Gospel do not go to extremes do not go beyond the bounds in your religion and do not say about God except the saying of the truth such as exalting Him above any associations with a partner or a child the Messiah Jesus the son of Mary was only the Messenger of God and His Word which He cast to which He conveyed to Mary and a spirit that is one whose spirit is from Him he Jesus is here attached to God exalted be He as an honouring for him and not as you claim that he is the son of God or a god alongside Him or one of three because one that possesses a spirit is compound while God transcends being compound and the attribution of compounds to Him. So believe in God and His messengers and do not say that the gods are ‘Three’ God Jesus and his mother. Refrain from this and say what it is better for you to say which is the profession of His Oneness. Verily God is but One God. Glory be to Him transcending the possibility that He should have a son! To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and in the earth as possessions creatures and servants and such sovereignty is not compatible with that prophethood of Jesus. God suffices as a Guardian a Witness to this."
  4,172,"The Messiah whom you claim is a god would never disdain would never scorn or reject haughtily to be a servant of God neither would the angels who are nigh to God disdain to be servants this is a splendid digression to the matter of the angels and it is mentioned as a refutation of those who claim that they the angels are gods or the daughters of God just as He refuted with what was stated before the Christians who claim that which is the subject of the address to them above. Whoever disdains to worship Him and waxes proud He will assuredly muster them to Him all of them in the Hereafter."
  4,173,"As for those who believed who did righteous deeds He will pay them in full their wages the reward for their deeds and He will give them more of His bounty what no eye has seen no ear has heard and no man’s heart has ever wished for; and as for them who disdain and are too proud to worship Him He will chastise them with a painful chastisement which is the chastisement of the Fire and they shall not find for themselves besides God that is other than Him any friend to ward it off them or helper to protect them from it."
  4,174,"O people a proof a definitive argument has now come to you from your Lord against you namely the Prophet s and We have revealed to you a manifest a clear light namely the Qur’ān."
  4,175,"As for those who believe in God and hold fast to Him He will surely admit them to mercy from Him and bounty and He will guide them to Him by a straight path namely the religion of Islam."
