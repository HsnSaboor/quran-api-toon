tafsir[8]{c,v,t}:
  47,12,"God will surely admit those who believe and perform righteous deeds into gardens underneath which rivers flow. As for those who disbelieve they take their enjoyment in this world and eat as the cattle eat that is to say they are only concerned with filling their bellies and satisfying their private parts without giving any thought to the Hereafter; and the Fire will be their habitation their home their station and their final destination."
  47,13,"And how many ka-ayyin means kam a town by which is meant the inhabitants thereof mightier in power than your town Mecca that is to say its inhabitants which expelled you akhrajatka is feminine despite the plural sense of inhabitants meant is because it takes into account the feminine form of qarya ‘town’ have We destroyed ahlaknāhum takes into account the former plural import of qarya ‘town’ and they had none to help them against Our destruction of them."
  47,14,"Is he who follows a clear sign a definitive argument and proof from his Lord and these are the believers like those whose evil deeds have been adorned for them so that they see them as fair deeds and these are the disbelievers of Mecca and who follow their desires? by worshipping graven images. In other words there is no similarity between the two."
  47,15,"A similitude a description of the Garden promised to the God-fearing the Garden that is shared equally by all those who enter it this first clause is the subject of which the predicate follows therein are rivers of unstaling water read āsin or asin similar in form to dārib ‘striker’ and hadhir ‘cautious’ that is to say one that does not change in contrast to the water of this world which may change due to some factor; and rivers of milk unchanging in flavour in contrast to the milk of this world on account of its issuing from udders and rivers of wine delicious to the drinkers in contrast to the wine of this world which is distasteful to drink; and also rivers of purified honey in contrast to the honey of this world which when it issues out of the bellies of bees becomes mixed with wax and other elements; and there will be for them therein varieties of every fruit and forgiveness from their Lord for He is pleased with them in addition to His beneficence towards them in the way mentioned in contrast to one who is a master of servants in this world who while being kind to them may at the same time be wrathful with them. Is such a one like him who abides in the Fire? ka-man huwa khālidun fī’l-nāri the predicate of an implied subject which is a-man huwa fī hādha’l-na‘īm ‘Is one who is amidst such bliss as him who abides in the Fire?’. And they will be given to drink boiling water which rips apart their bowels that is their entrails so that these will be excreted from their rears. Am‘ā’ ‘bowels’ is the plural of mi‘an its alif being derived from the yā’ of their saying mi‘yān as an alternative singular to mi‘an."
  47,16,"And there are some among them namely the disbelievers who listen to you during the Friday sermon — and these are the hypocrites; until when they go forth from you they say to those who have been given knowledge that is to say to the knowledgeable ones among the Companions of the Prophet such as ‘Abd Allāh Ibn Mas‘ūd and ‘Abd Allāh Ibn ‘Abbās in derision and mockery ‘What was he saying just now?’ read ānifan or anifan meaning al-sā‘a ‘just now’. In other words they mean to say ‘we will not go back to listen to him again’. Those are the ones on whose hearts God has set a seal of disbelief and who follow their own desires in acting with hypocrisy."
  47,17,"But those who are rightly guided namely the believers He God enhances their guidance and invests them with fear of Him He inspires them to do that by which they can be wary of ending up in the Fire."
  47,18,"Do they then await they do not await namely the disbelievers of Mecca anything except that the Hour should come upon them an ta’tiyahum is an inclusive substitution for al-sā‘ata ‘the Hour’; in other words it cannot be other than that it will come upon them … suddenly? For already its portents the signs thereof have come among which are the sending of the Prophet s the splitting of the Moon Q. 541 and the Smoke Q. 4410. So when it the Hour has come upon them for what benefit will their reminder be? their remembering; in other words it will be of no benefit to them."
  47,19,"Know then that there is no god except God that is to say adhere O Muhammad (s) to knowledge of this fact that will benefit you at the Resurrection and ask forgiveness for your sin — this was said to him despite his infallibility ‘isma so that his community might emulate him in this respect. Indeed he did do this. The Prophet s said ‘Verily I do ask God for forgiveness a hundred times every day’ — and for the believing men and believing women — herein is an honouring for them by having their Prophet enjoined to ask forgiveness for them. And God knows your going to and fro your bustle during the day in pursuit of your business and your place of rest when you retire to where you sleep at night. In other words He has knowledge of all your states nothing of which can be hidden from Him so be mindful of Him — the address in this verse is meant for believers as well as others."
