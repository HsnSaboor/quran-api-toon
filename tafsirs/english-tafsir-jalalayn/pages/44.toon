  2,260,"And mention when Abraham said ‘My Lord show me how You give life to the dead’ He God exalted be He said to him ‘Why do you not believe?’ in My power to revive; God asks him this even though He knows of his belief in this power as a response to his request and so that the ones listening will know the purpose of the request; ‘Yes’ I do believe he said ‘but I ask You so that my heart may be re-assured’ so that it may be at peace through direct vision in addition to that certainty which is sought through logical reasoning. Said He ‘Take four birds and twist them to you sirhunna or surhunna turn them towards you cut them up and mix together their flesh and feathers then set a part of them on every hill in the land around you then summon them to you and they will come to you in haste. And know that God is Mighty that nothing is beyond Him Wise’ in His actions. Abraham took a peacock an eagle a raven and a cock and did with them as has been mentioned but kept their heads with him. He called them and all the parts began to fly back together combining until they were whole and returning to their heads."
  2,261,"The likeness of the quality of the expenditure of those who expend their wealth in the way of God that is in obedience of Him is as the likeness of a grain of corn that sprouts seven ears in every ear a hundred grains likewise what they expend will be multiplied seven hundred times; so God multiplies even more than this for whom He will; God is Embracing in His bounty Knowing those who deserve such multiplications."
  2,262,"Those who expend their wealth in the way of God then do not follow up their expenditure with reminder of their generosity of the one on whom they expended for example by saying ‘I was good to him and restored his affairs’; and injury to that person by mentioning this to people whom he would prefer not to know about it; their wage the reward for their expenditure is with their Lord and no fear shall befall them neither shall they grieve in the Hereafter."
  2,263,"Honourable words kind talk and a generous reply to the beggar and forgiveness towards him for his persistence are better than a voluntary almsgiving followed by injury through reproach and deriding him for his begging; and God is Independent of the voluntary almsgiving of His servants Forbearing in His delaying the punishment of the reproachful and injurious one."
  2,264,"O you who believe annul not the rewards of your voluntary almsgivings with reproach and injury as in the manner of the annulment of the expenditure of one who expends of his substance to show off to men and believes not in God and the Last Day this is the hypocrite. The likeness of him is as the likeness of a smooth rock on which is soil and a torrent of intense rain smites it and leaves it barren and smooth with nothing on it. They have no power lā yaqdirūna is a resumption of the statement about the likeness of the one that expends for show; the person becomes plural on account of the potential plural implication of alladhī ‘the one who’ over anything that they have earned that they did in other words they find no reward for it in the Hereafter just as one finds nothing of the dust that was on the surface of the smooth rock after the rain has washed it away. God guides not the disbelieving folk."
