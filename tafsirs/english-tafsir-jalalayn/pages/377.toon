  27,1,"Tā sīn God knows best what He means by these letters. Those namely these signs are the signs of the Qur’ān signs from it and a Manifest Book manifesting what is truth from what is falsehood wa-kitābin ‘Book’ is a supplement to al-qur’ān with the addition of an adjective mubīn ‘manifest’."
  27,2,"It is a guidance guiding from error and good tidings for the believers who believe in it of Paradise;"
  27,3,"those who observe prayer performing it in the way that it should be performed and give alms and who are certain of the Hereafter knowing it to be true through the many proofs thereof hum ‘they’ is repeated because a separation has taken place between it the first hum and the predicate yūqinūna."
  27,4,"Truly those who do not believe in the Hereafter We have adorned their vile deeds for them by making such deeds seem sensuous so that they then deem them wholesome and so they are bewildered confused about why We deem these deeds to be vile."
  27,5,"Those are they for whom there is an awful chastisement the worst chastisement in this world being killed or being taken captive; and in the Hereafter they will be the greatest losers because they will end up in the Fire which has been made everlasting for them."
  27,6,"And truly you — this is an address to the Prophet s — are receiving the Qur’ān it is being transmitted to you intensely from One Wise Knowing in such transmission."
  27,7,"Mention when Moses said to his family to his wife during his journey from Midian back to Egypt ‘Assuredly I notice I see in the distance a fire. I will bring you news from there about the journey’s route — for he had lost his way — or bring you a firebrand read as a genitive annexation bi-shihābi qabasin as an explication of shihāb ‘flame’; or read without annexation bi-shihābin qabasin meaning a flame of fire at the end of a wick or a wooden stick that perhaps you might warm yourselves’ tastalūn the tā’ replaces the tā’ of the 8th verbal form ifta‘ala sc. istalā; it derives from salaya or saliya ‘to be exposed to the blaze of fire’ that perhaps you might warm yourselves from the cold."
  27,8,"But when he reached it he was called with the following words ‘Blessed is he that is to say God bless him who is in the fire namely Moses and who is around it namely the angels — or vice-versa the verb bāraka may be followed immediately by the direct object or by a preposition and then the direct object; a noun such as makān ‘location’ is implied after fī ‘in’ sc. man fī makāni’l-nār ‘who is in the area of the fire’; and Glory be to God the Lord of the Worlds — this is included in the call and is meant to declare that God is above all evil associations."
  27,9,"O Moses lo! in other words the fact is that it is I God the Mighty the Wise."
  27,10,"Throw down your staff’ and he threw it down. And when he saw it wriggling moving like a serpent a slender snake he turned his back in flight and did not come back.

  27,11,"except him who has wronged his soul but then changed his wrong for good — he then performs good deeds — after having done evil in other words he has repented then truly I am Forgiving Merciful I will accept his repentance and forgive him."

  27,13,"But when Our signs came to them plain to see illuminating and clear they said ‘This is manifest sorcery’ clear and evident sorcery."
