tafsir[5]{c,v,t}:
  65,1,"O Prophet meaning to address his community on account of what follows; or it means say to them when you men divorce women when you intend to effect a divorce divorce them by their prescribed period at the beginning of it such that the divorce is effected while she is pure and has not been touched sexually based on the Prophet’s s explaining it in this way as reported by the two Shaykhs al-Bukhārī and Muslim. And count the prescribed period keep record of it so that you may repeal your decision before it is concluded; and fear God your Lord obey Him in His commands and prohibitions. Do not expel them from their houses nor let them go forth from them until their prescribed period is concluded unless they commit a blatant act of indecency such as adultery read mubayyana or mubayyina corresponding respectively to buyyinat ‘one that has been proven’ and bayyina ‘blatant’ in which case they are brought out in order to carry out the prescribed legal punishment against them. And those mentioned stipulations are God’s bounds; and whoever transgresses the bounds of God has verily wronged his soul. You never know it may be that God will bring something new to pass afterwards after the divorce such as a retraction in the event that it was the first or second declaration of divorce."
  65,2,"Then when they have reached their term when they are near the end of their prescribed period retain them by taking them back honourably without coercion or separate from them honourably leave them to conclude their waiting period and do not compel them to go back to you. And call to witness two just men from among yourselves to witness the retraction or the separation and bear witness for the sake of God and not merely for the sake of what is being witnessed or for the sake of the man. By this is exhorted whoever believes in God and the Last Day. And whoever fears God He will make a way out for him from the distress of this world and the Hereafter;"
  65,3,"and He will provide for him from whence he never expected from whence it never occurred to him. And whoever puts his trust in God regarding his affairs He will suffice him. Indeed God fulfils His command His will a variant reading for bālighun amrahu has the genitive construction bālighu amrihi. Verily God has ordained for everything even things such as comfort and hardship a measure a fixed time."
  65,4,"And as for those of your women who read allā’ī or allā’i in both instances no longer expect to menstruate if you have any doubts about their waiting period their prescribed waiting period shall be three months and also for those who have not yet menstruated because of their young age their period shall also be three months — both cases apply to other than those whose spouses have died; for these latter their period is prescribed in the verse they shall wait by themselves for four months and ten days Q. 2234. And those who are pregnant their term the conclusion of their prescribed waiting period if divorced or if their spouses be dead shall be when they deliver. And whoever fears God He will make matters ease for him in this world and in the Hereafter."
  65,5,"That which is mentioned regarding the prescribed waiting period is God’s command His ruling which He has revealed to you. And whoever fears God He will absolve him of his misdeeds and magnify the reward for him."
