tafsir[6]{c,v,t}:
  6,132,"All of those who perform deeds shall have degrees of requital according to what they have done of good or evil. Your Lord is not heedless of what they do ya‘malūna may also be read ta‘malūna ‘you do’."
  6,133,"Your Lord is Independent of His creatures and their worship the Lord of Mercy. If He will He can remove you O people of Mecca by destroying you and leave whom He will of creatures to succeed after you just as He produced you from the seed of another folk whom He removed; but He has spared you as a mercy to you."
  6,134,"Truly that which you are promised of the Hour and chastisement will surely come to pass inevitably and you cannot escape you cannot elude Our chastisement."
  6,135,"Say to them ‘O my people act according to your state your circumstances; truly I am acting according to my circumstances. And assuredly you will know whose man the relative particle introducing the object of the verb ‘you will know’ sequel shall be the abode that is who shall have the praiseworthy sequel in the abode of the Hereafter will it be us or yourselves? Surely the evildoers the disbelievers will not prosper’ will not find happiness."
  6,136,"They the disbelievers of Mecca assign to God of the tillage the crops and the cattle which He multiplied He created a portion which they dispense to visitors and the needy and to their associates belongs a portion which they dispense to such keepers of the tillage and cattle saying ‘This is for God’ — so they assert read bi-za‘mihim or bi-zu‘mihim — ‘and this is for our associates’ and if any of the portion of these associates fell into God’s portion they used to restore it to that of their associates but when something of His portion fell into theirs they would leave it there saying ‘God is Independent and is not in need of this’ as God exalted be He says So that which is intended for their associates does not reach God and that which is intended for God does reach their associates. Evil is that provision of theirs which they decree!"
  6,137,"And thus in the same way that what is mentioned was adorned for them those associates of theirs from among the jinn have adorned for many of the idolaters the slaying of their children by burying them alive shurakā’uhum ‘those associates of theirs’ is read in the nominative as the subject of the verb zayyana ‘adorned’; an alternative reading has the passive zuyyina ‘it has been adorned’ with qatlu ‘the slaying’ in the nominative as the subject of this passive verb awlādahum ‘their children’ in the accusative on account of it being the direct object of qatlu ‘the slaying’ and shurakā’ihim in the genitive as an annexation to qatlu so that the object in this case intervenes between the two elements of the annexation qatlu awlādahum shurakā’ihim ‘their associates killing the children’ — this is acceptable syntactically — and the annexation of qatlu to shurakā’ihim in this latter reading is on account of them the associates commanding the idolaters to do this that they may destroy them and to confuse to make obscure their religion for them. Had God willed they would not have done so; so leave them and that which they fabricate."
