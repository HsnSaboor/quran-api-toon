  24,45,"And God has created every beast that is every animal from fluid from a sperm-drop. Among them are some that creep upon their bellies such as snakes and reptiles and among them are some that walk on two feet such as human beings and birds and among them are some that walk on four such as four-legged beasts and cattle. God creates whatever He will. Truly God has power over all things."
  24,46,"And verily We have revealed manifest signs namely the Qur’ān; and God guides whomever He will to a straight path a straight route and that is the religion of Islam."
  24,47,"And they the hypocrites say ‘We believe in we affirm the truth of God of His Oneness and the Messenger Muhammad (s) and we obey’ them in what rulings they God and Muhammad give. Then after that a party of them turn away they are averse to it and those those who are averse they are not believers as believers should be believers whose hearts agree with the words of their tongues."

  24,51,"All that the believers say when they are summoned to God and His Messenger that he may judge between them is that they say in other words the saying that befits them is to say ‘We hear and we obey’ by responding to the summons. And those then are the successful the ones who will be saved."
  24,52,"And he who obeys God and His Messenger and fears God and fears Him read yattaqh or yattaqhi by being obedient to Him those they are the winners of Paradise."
  24,53,"And they swear by God solemn oaths that if you order them to participate in the struggle they will surely go forth. Say to them ‘Do not swear! Acknowledged obedience to the Prophet is better than the oaths to which you are not true. Surely God is Aware of what you do’ when you say you will obey but act otherwise."
