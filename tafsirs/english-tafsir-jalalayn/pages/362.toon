tafsir[12]{c,v,t}:
  25,21,"And those who do not expect to encounter Us those who have no fear of the Resurrection say ‘Why have the angels not been sent down to us to act as messengers to us or why do we not see our Lord?’ so that we might be informed by Him that Muhammad (s) is truly His Messenger? God exalted be He says Assuredly they are full of arrogance within their souls and have become terribly insolent in demanding to see God exalted be He in this world read ‘utuwwan ‘insolence’ with the wāw according to the original root form as opposed to ‘itiyyan with the yā’ substitution as in sūrat Maryam Q. 198."
  25,22,"The day when they see the angels while they stand together with the rest of creation namely on the Day of Resurrection yawma is in the accusative because of an implied preceding udhkur ‘mention’ there will be no good tidings on that day for the guilty that is the disbelievers in contrast to the believers for whom there shall be the good tidings of Paradise and they will say ‘A forbidding ban!’ as was their the pagan custom in this world whenever a misfortune befell them; in other words they mean ‘awdhan ma‘ādhan seeking refuge from the angels who will chastise them. God exalted be He says"
  25,23,"And We shall attend to We shall turn to the works they did that were good such as voluntary alms or kindness to kin a hospitable reception of a guest or the succour of a troubled person in this world and turn them into scattered dust habā’an manthūran namely as those individual particles of dust which one might observe near a window when the sun is shining through. In other words We shall make their good works like those particles of dust in their uselessness there being no reward for such works for lack of any binding obligation to reward them therefor; but they are rewarded for it in the life of this world."
  25,24,"Those who will be the inhabitants of Paradise on that day the Day of Resurrection will be in a far better abode than are the disbelievers in this world and a far better resting place than theirs the latter’s; in other words a better place for qā’ila which is a rest taken during midday during hot days. From this last interpretation of maqīlan it has been inferred that the Reckoning will be concluded in half a day as is stated in one hadīth."
  25,25,"And on the day when the heaven each of the seven heavens will be split asunder with the clouds in other words split asunder together with them the clouds al-ghamām is white cloud and the angels will be sent down from every heaven in a majestic descent and this is the Day of Resurrection it yawma ‘on the day’ is in the accusative because of an implied preceding udhkur ‘mention’; a variant reading for tashaqqaqu is tashshaqqaqu ‘will be split asunder’ where the second tā’ of the original form tatashaqqaqu has been assimilated with it the the shīn; another variant reading instead of nuzzila al-malā’ikatu ‘the angels will be sent down’ has nunzilu al-malā’ikata ‘We will send down the angels’;"
  25,26,"true Sovereignty on that day will belong to the Compassionate One with no one else sharing it with Him and it that day will be a hard day for the disbelievers in contrast to the believers."
  25,27,"And it will be a day when the wrongdoer the idolater ‘Uqba b. Abī Mu‘ayt — who had uttered the two-part profession ‘there is no god but God Muhammad (s) is His Messenger’ but retracted it in order to please Ubayy b. Khalaf — will bite his hands in regret and anguish on the Day of Resurrection saying ‘O yā is for drawing attention would that I had followed a way with the Messenger! Muhammad (s) a route to guidance."
  25,28,"O woe to me! yā waylatā the final alif stands in place of the first person singular possessive yā’ yā waylatī meaning ‘alas for my destruction!’ Would that I had not taken so and so in other words that Ubayy as friend!"
  25,29,"Verily he has led me astray from the Remembrance namely the Qur’ān after it had come to me by causing me to recant my belief in it. God exalted be He says And Satan is ever a deserter of the disbelieving man’ abandoning him and dissociating from him in times of tribulation."
  25,30,"And the Messenger Muhammad (s) says ‘O my Lord lo! my people the tribe of Quraysh consider this Qur’ān as something to be shunned’ to be disregarded."
  25,31,"God exalted be He says So just as We have appointed for you enemies from among the idolaters of your people We have appointed to every prophet before you an enemy from among the guilty the idolaters — so be steadfast as they were; but your Lord suffices as a Guide for you and a Helper to bring you victory over your enemies."
  25,32,"And those who disbelieve say ‘Why has the Qur’ān not been revealed to him all at once?’ as the Torah the Gospel and the Book of Psalms were. God exalted be He says We have revealed it thus in parts it is that We may strengthen your inner-heart with it and We have arranged it in a specific order that is to say We produce it in stages one part after another gradually and deliberately in order to facilitate its comprehension and its memorisation."
