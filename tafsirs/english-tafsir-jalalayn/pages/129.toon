  6,9,"And had We appointed him the one who is sent down to them an angel We would assuredly have made him the angel a man that is We would have sent him in the form of a man so that they would be able to see him since no human being is capable of seeing an angel; and had We sent him down and made him a man We would have assuredly confused obscured for them what they are confusing for themselves when they say ‘This is but a mere mortal like the rest of you’."
  6,10,"And messengers were indeed mocked before you — this is meant as a consolation for the Prophet s — but those who scoffed at them were encompassed by that which they mocked namely by the punishment sent down on them those who mock you will be encompassed likewise."
  6,11,"Say to them ‘Travel in the land and see the nature of the consequence for the deniers’ of the messengers how they were destroyed through chastisement; perhaps they will take heed."
  6,12,"Say ‘To whom belongs what is in the heavens and in the earth?’ Say ‘To God for even if they do not say this there is no other response. He has prescribed He has decreed for Himself mercy as a bounty from Him — this is a gentle summoning of them to the faith. He will surely gather you together on the Day of Resurrection of which there is no doubt no uncertainty in order to requite you for your deeds. Those who have forfeited their own souls this is the subject — by exposing them to the chastisement — they do not believe this is the predicate."

  6,14,"Say to them ‘Shall I take as a protector to worship other than God the Originator of the heavens and the earth the One Who has created them without any precedent He Who feeds Who gives sustenance and is not fed?’ and is not given sustenance.

  6,15,"Say ‘Indeed I fear if I should rebel against my Lord by worshipping other than Him the chastisement of a dreadful day’ namely the Day of Resurrection."
  6,16,"He from whom it is averted read passive yusraf ‘it is averted’ namely ‘the chastisement’; or read active yasrif ‘He averts’ namely ‘God’ as the subject; the referential noun has been omitted on that day He the Exalted One will have had mercy on him He will have desired good for him; that is the manifest triumph evident salvation."
  6,17,"And if God touches you with an affliction a trial such as an illness or impoverishment then none can remove it none can lift it except Him; and if He touches you with good such as health and affluence then He has power over all things including His touching you with this and none other than Him has the power to remove it from you."
