tafsir[13]{c,v,t}:
  18,98,"Said he Dhū’l-Qarnayn ‘This namely the barrier the ability to make it is a mercy from my Lord a grace from Him because it prevents them from coming forth. But when the promise of my Lord comes to pass the promise of their coming forth which will be near the time of the Resurrection He will level it pulverised and flattened for my Lord’s promise of their coming forth and of other things is always true’ it will be. God exalted be He says"
  18,99,"And on that day the day of their coming forth We shall let some of them surge against others mixing with one another on account of their multitude and the Trumpet namely the Horn signalling the Resurrection shall be blown and We shall gather them namely creatures in one place on the Day of Resurrection a single gathering."
  18,100,"And on that day We shall present We shall bring close Hell to the disbelievers plain to view"
  18,101,"those disbelievers whose eyes alladhīna kānat a‘yunuhum substitutes for al-kāfirīna ‘the disbelievers’ were masked from My remembrance namely the Qur’ān such that they were blind unable to be guided thereby and who could not bear to hear that is to say they were unable to listen to what the Prophet used to recite to them out of spite for him and so they did not believe therein."
  18,102,"Do the disbelievers reckon that they can take My servants namely My angels as well as Jesus and Ezra as patrons as lords beside Me? awliyā’a ‘as patrons’ constitutes the second direct object of the verb yattakhidhū ‘that they can take’; the second direct object of the verb hasiba ‘reckon’ has been omitted. The meaning is do they suppose that the mentioned ‘taking as patrons’ will not incur My wrath and that I will not punish them for this? No! Truly We have prepared Hell for the disbelievers these the ones mentioned above and others as a place of hospitality in other words it has been prepared for them just as a house is prepared for a guest."
  18,103,"Say ‘Shall We inform you who will be the greatest losers in regard to their works? al-akhsarīna a‘mālan a specification that happens to correspond to that which is specifically meant; and these losers are described in His words as being"
  18,104,"Those whose effort goes astray in the life of this world those whose deeds are invalid while they reckon they think that they are doing good work good deeds for which they will be rewarded."
  18,105,"Those are they who disbelieve in the signs of their Lord in the proofs of His Oneness proofs such as the Qur’ān and otherwise and the encounter with Him’ that is and who disbelieve in resurrection reckoning reward and punishment. So their works have failed they are invalid and on the Day of Resurrection We shall not assign any weight to them in other words We shall not accord them any value."
  18,106,"That namely the matter which I God have mentioned concerning the failure of their deeds and so on dhālika ‘that’ constitutes the subject is their requital — Hell — because they disbelieved and took My signs and My messengers in mockery that is to say taking both of them as something to be derided."
  18,107,"Truly those who believe and perform righteous deeds — theirs will be according to God’s prescience the gardens of Firdaws which are at the centre of Paradise and at its highest part the annexation thereto of firdaws to jannāt ‘gardens’ is explicative as a place of hospitality as an abode;"
  18,108,"wherein they will abide with no desire demand to be removed from them to be transferred to some other gardens."
  18,109,"Say ‘If the sea in other words if its waters were ink midād is what one writes with for the Words of my Lord Words that testify to His laws and His marvels such that these Words are written with it the sea would be spent in recording them before the Words of my Lord were spent read as tanfada or yanfada even though We brought the like of it namely the like of the sea as replenishment’ in order to add it to the other sea it would also be spent while they God’s Words would not be exhausted madadan ‘as replenishment’ in the accusative because it is a specification."
  18,110,"Say ‘I am only a human being a son of Adam like you; it has been revealed to me that your God is only One God annamā the anna assimilated with the mā retains its function of referring to the verbal noun in other words the Oneness of the Divine is what is being revealed to me. So whoever hopes to encounter his Lord through the Resurrection and the Requital let him do righteous work and not associate with the worship of his Lord that is to say let him not commit idolatry in performing it by feigning faith before anyone’."
