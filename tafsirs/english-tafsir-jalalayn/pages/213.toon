tafsir[9]{c,v,t}:
  10,34,"Say ‘Is there of those whom you associate with God one that originates creation then recreated it?’ Say ‘God originates creation then recreates it. How then are you deviated?’ turned away from worshipping Him despite proof having been established."
  10,35,"Say ‘Is there of those whom you associate with God one that guides to the truth?’ by means of setting up definitive arguments and creating guidance. Say ‘God guides to the truth; is One Who guides to the truth — and this is God — more deserving of being followed or one who does not guide one who is not himself guided unless he is guided? more deserving of being followed? the interrogative is meant as an affirmation and a rebuke in other words the former is more deserving. So what is wrong with you how do you judge?’ how do you make this corrupt judgement one where what does not deserve to be followed is followed?"
  10,36,"And most of them in worshipping idols follow nothing but conjecture since they imitate their fathers therein; truly conjecture avails nothing against truth when what is sought is knowledge. Surely God is Knower of what they do and will requite them for it."
  10,37,"And this Qur’ān is not such as could ever be produced that is it could not be a fabrication by anyone besides God; but it is revealed as a confirmation of what is before it of Scriptures and a detailing of the Book a exposition of the rulings and other matters which God has prescribed — wherein is no doubt no uncertainty — from the Lord of the Worlds min rabbi’l-‘ālamīn is semantically connected to tasdīqa ‘a confirmation’ or to an omitted unzila ‘revealed’; a variant reading for accusative tasdīqa has the nominative tasdīqu and nominative tafsīlu ‘a detailing’ for the accusative tafsīla by reading an implied huwa ‘it is’."
  10,38,"Or do they say ‘He has invented it’? Muhammad (s) has invented it. Say ‘Then bring a sūra like it in terms of the clarity and the rhetorical excellence of its language by way of invention for you are eloquent speakers of Arabic like me; and call upon whom you can for help in this matter besides God that is other than Him if you are truthful’ in saying that this is an invention. But they were not able to do this."
  10,39,"God exalted be He says Nay but they denied that the knowledge whereof they did not comprehend that is they denied the Qur’ān and did not reflected upon it; and whereof the interpretation the consequence of the threats made therein has not yet come to them. So in the same manner of denial those who were before them denied their messengers. Behold then what was the consequence for the evildoers! for denying the messengers in other words behold how their affair was concluded by their being destroyed. In a similar manner We shall destroy these people."
  10,40,"And of them that is of the people of Mecca are some who believe in it God being aware of this in their case and some who would never believe therein. And your Lord knows very well the corrupters this is a threat for them."
  10,41,"If they deny you then say to them ‘Unto me is my work and to you your work that is for each there will be a due requital of his deeds; you are innocent of what I do and I am innocent of what you do’ this was abrogated by the ‘sword’ verse Q. 95."
  10,42,"And of them are some who listen to you when you recite the Qur’ān. But will you make the deaf to hear — He likens them the Meccan disbelievers to these the deaf because they are not able to benefit from what is recited to them — even though with their deafness they do not understand? even though they do not reflect?"
