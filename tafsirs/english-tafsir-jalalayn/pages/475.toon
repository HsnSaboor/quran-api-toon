tafsir[11]{c,v,t}:
  40,67,"He it is Who created you from dust by having created your father Adam from it then from a drop of sperm then from a blood-clot congealed blood then He brings you forth as infants then He sustains you that you may come of age until you have attained your full strength — this being from the age of thirty to forty — then that you may become aged read shuyūkhan or shiyūkhan— though there are some of you who die earlier that is before coming of age or becoming aged. He does this to you so that you may live on and that you may complete an appointed term a defined length of time that perhaps you might understand the proofs of His Oneness and thus become believers."
  40,68,"He it is Who gives life and brings death. So when He decides upon a matter when He wants to bring something into existence He only says to it ‘Be!’ and it is read fa-yakūnu or fa-yakūna in the subjunctive on account of an implied preceding an. In other words it comes into existence after He has willed it that which is signified by the said words."
  40,69,"Have you not regarded those who dispute the signs of God the Qur’ān how they are turned away? from faith —"
  40,70,"those who deny the Book the Qur’ān and that wherewith We have sent Our messengers in the way of the affirmation of God’s Oneness and belief in the Resurrection — and these deniers are the Meccan disbelievers. But they will come to know the punishment for their denials;"
  40,71,"when idh has the meaning of idhā with fetters around their necks and chains wa’l-salāsilu a supplement to al-aghlālu ‘fetters’ so that the meaning is that these chains are also around their necks; or it al-salāsilu ‘chains’ is the subject the predicate of which has been omitted in other words the meaning being around their feet will be these chains — or alternatively its predicate is the following yushabūna they are dragged in other words they are dragged away by these chains."
  40,72,"into the boiling water that is into Hell then in the Fire they are set aflame."
  40,73,"Then it will be said to them in reproach ‘Where are those whom you used to make partners"
  40,74,"besides God?’ alongside Him and these are the idols. They will say ‘They have forsaken abandoned us and so we cannot see them. Nay but actually we were not invoking anything before’. They deny that they used to worship these idols; but then these idols are brought before them — which is where God exalted be He says ‘Truly you and what you worship besides God shall be fuel for Hell’ Q. 2198. So in the same way that these disbelievers have been led astray God leads astray the disbelievers."
  40,75,"And it will also be said to them ‘That chastisement is because you used to exult in the earth without right by your idolatry and denial of resurrection and because you were insolent committing acts of disobedience in abundance."
  40,76,"Enter the gates of Hell to abide therein’. Evil then is the ultimate abode of the arrogant!"
  40,77,"So be patient. Assuredly God’s promise to chastise them is true. And if We show you fa-immā contains an assimilated conditional particle in; the mā is extra and emphasises the conditional import at the beginning of the verb while the nūn emphasises it at the end a part of what We promise them of chastisement in your lifetime the response to the conditional has been omitted in other words it is something like ‘then so be it!’ … or We take you unto Us in death before their chastisement then in any case to Us they will be returned whereupon We shall chastise them with the most severe punishment this last mentioned response is that of the supplement only."
