That is better for you and purer for your sins. But if you find nothing to offer as alms then God is indeed Forgiving of your secret conversation Merciful to you. In other words nothing will be held against you for holding a secret conversation without having offered some voluntary alms beforehand. However He God abrogated this later by saying"
  58,13,"Do you fear read a-ashfaqtum either pronouncing both hamzas fully or by replacing the second one with an alif or not pronouncing it but inserting an alif between the one not unpronounced and the other one or without this insertion poverty when you fear to offer voluntary alms before your secret talks.
