tafsir[17]{c,v,t}:
  23,1,"Indeed qad is for confirmation prosperous victorious are the believers"
  23,2,"those who in their prayers are humble"
  23,3,"and who shun vain talk and other nonsense"
  23,4,"and who fulfil payment of alms"
  23,5,"and who guard their private parts against what is unlawful"
  23,6,"except from their spouses that is to their spouses and what slaves their right hands possess that is concubines for then they are not blameworthy in having sexual intercourse with them."
  23,7,"But whoever seeks anything beyond that intercourse with wives and concubines such as masturbation those they are transgressors who have overstepped the bounds into what is not lawful for them."
  23,8,"And who are keepers of their trusts may be read as plural amānātihim ‘their trusts’ or singular amānatihim ‘their trust’ and covenants made between them or between them and God such as the observance of prayer and so on."
  23,9,"And who are watchful of their prayers may be read as plural salawātihim ‘their prayers’ or singular salātihim ‘their prayer’ observing them at their appointed times."
  23,10,"Those they are the inheritors and none other than them"
  23,11,"who shall inherit Paradise al-firdaws the name of a garden the highest of the gardens of Heaven — wherein they will abide; herein is an allusion to the Return in the Hereafter and so it is fitting that the Beginning of creation should be mentioned next"
  23,12,"And by God We certainly created man Adam from an extraction min sulālatin derives from the verbal expression salaltu’l-shay’a mina’l-shay’ ‘I drew one thing out of another’ meaning ‘I extracted it therefrom’ his Adam’s substance being of clay min tīnin is semantically connected to sulālatin ‘an extraction’."
  23,13,"Then We made him namely man the progeny of Adam a drop a sperm-drop in a secure lodging which is the womb."
  23,14,"Then We transformed the drop of semen into a clot congealed blood. Then We transformed the clot into a little lump of flesh mudgha a piece of flesh about the size of what one would be able to chew mā yumdagh. Then We transformed the lump of flesh into bones. Then We clothed the bones with flesh a variant reading in both instances instead of the plurals ‘izāman and al-‘izāma ‘the bones’ is singular ‘azman and ‘al-‘azma ‘the bone’; and in all three instances above khalaqnā means ‘We made it become’ as opposed to ‘We created’. Then We produced him as yet another creature by breathing into him Our Spirit. So blessed be God the best of creators! that is the best of determiners the specificier noun for ahsana ‘the best’ has been omitted because it is obvious khalqan ‘in terms of creation’."
  23,15,"Then indeed after that you die."
  23,16,"Then on the Day of Resurrection you shall surely be raised for reckoning and requital."
  23,17,"And verily We created above you seven paths that is seven heavens tarā’iq is the plural of tarīqa so called because they are the paths used by the angels and of creation that lies beneath these paths We are never unmindful lest these should fall upon them and destroy them. Nay but We hold them back as stated in the verse And He holds back the heaven lest it should fall upon the earth Q. 2265."
