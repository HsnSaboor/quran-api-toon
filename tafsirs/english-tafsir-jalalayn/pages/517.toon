tafsir[7]{c,v,t}:
  49,12,"O you who believe shun much suspicion. Indeed some suspicions are sins that is to say it causes one to fall into sin. This suspicion may have many forms such as thinking ill of the good folk from among the believers — and such good folk are many — in contrast to the immoral individuals among them in whose case there is no sin so long as it the suspicion is in accordance with their outward behaviour. And do not spy tajassasū one of the two tā’ letters of tatajassasū has been omitted do not pursue the imperfections and faults of Muslims by searching them out; nor backbite one another do not speak of him by mentioning something which he is averse to having mentioned of himself even if it be true. Would any of you love to eat the flesh of his brother dead? read maytan or mayyitan. That is to say it would not be right for him to do so. You would abhor it. Thus to backbite him in life would be like eating his flesh when he is dead. This latter form of behaviour has been suggested to you and you were averse to it so be averse to the former too. And fear God that is His punishment for backbiting by repenting of it; assuredly God is Relenting accepting of the penitence of those who repent Merciful to them."
  49,13,"O mankind! We have indeed created you from a male and a female from Adam and Eve and made you nations shu‘ūb is the plural of sha‘b which is the broadest category of lineage and tribes qabā’il which are smaller than nations and are followed by ‘amā’ir ‘tribal districts’ then butūn ‘tribal sub-districts’ then afkhādh ‘sub-tribes’ and finally fasā’il ‘clans’; for example Khuzayma is the sha‘b while Kināna is the qabīla Quraysh is the ‘imāra Qusayy is the batn Hāshim is the fakhdh and ‘Abbās is the fasīla that you may come to know one another ta‘ārafū one of the two tā’ letters of tata‘ārafū has been omitted that you may acquire knowledge of the customs of one another and not to boast to one another of whose is the more noble lineage for pride lies only in the extent to which you have fear of God. Truly the noblest of you in the sight of God is the most God-fearing among you. Truly God is Knower of you Aware of your inner thoughts."
  49,14,"The Bedouins — a group of men from among the Banū Asad — say ‘We believe’ we affirm the truth in our hearts. Say to them ‘You do not believe; but rather say “We have submitted” we are outwardly compliant; for faith has not yet entered into your hearts’ hitherto; however it is expected of you. Yet if you obey God and His Messenger by embracing faith and in other ways He will not diminish for you read ya’litkum or yalitkum by making the hamza an alif anything of your deeds that is of the reward for them. God is indeed Forgiving to believers Merciful to them."
  49,15,"The true believers that is those who are true in their affirmation of faith — as He makes explicit in what follows — are only those who believe in God and His Messenger and then have not doubted they have not been uncertain of their faith and who strive with their wealth and their souls for the cause of God hence their striving manifests the sincerity of their faith. It is they who are sincere in their faith not those who say ‘We believe’ and from whom all that has been forthcoming is their submission to the religion."
  49,16,"Say to them ‘Do you pretend to inform God about your religion read the doubled 2nd verbal form a-tu‘allimūna ‘do you inform’ in other words are you intimating to Him your religious status when you say ‘We believe’ when God knows all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth and even though God is Knower of all things?’"
  49,17,"They deem it to be a favour to you that they have submitted without the need for any fighting unlike those others who submitted only after being fought. Say ‘Do not deem your submission to be a favour to me islāmakum ‘your submission’ has dependent accusative status because of the omission of the genitive preposition bi-which is also read as implicit before the an in both instances. Rather it is God Who has done you a favour in that He has guided you to faith if you are being sincere when you say ‘We believe’."
  49,18,"Truly God knows the Unseen of the heavens and the earth that is He knows all that is hidden in both and God is Seer of what you do’ may be read either as ya‘malūna ‘they do’ or ta‘malūna ‘you do’ nothing of which can be concealed from Him."
