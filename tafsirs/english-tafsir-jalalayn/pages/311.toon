tafsir[19]{c,v,t}:
  19,77,"Have you seen him who disbelieves in Our signs namely al-‘Ās b. Wā’il and says to Khabbāb b. al-Aratt — who had said to him ‘You will be resurrected after death!’ and who had requested from him repayment of money — ‘I shall assuredly be given on the supposition that there is such a thing as resurrection wealth and children?’ and so I will repay you then. God exalted be He says"
  19,78,"Has he come to learn something of the Unseen that is has he been given some knowledge of it and of the fact that he will be given what he has mentioned here the interrogative hamza of a-ittala‘a ‘has he come to learn?’ suffices in place of the conjunctive hamza which has therefore been omitted or has he made a covenant with the Compassionate One? to the effect that he be given what he claims?"
  19,79,"Nay he shall not be given any of that but We will assuredly write down We shall command that it be written down that which he says and prolong for him the chastisement endlessly We shall give him because of that claim an extra chastisement in addition to the chastisement for his disbelief;"
  19,80,"and We shall take over from him that which he talks about of wealth and children and he shall come to Us on the Day of Resurrection alone with neither wealth nor children."
  19,81,"And they namely the disbelievers of Mecca have taken besides God graven images as other gods for them to worship that they may be for them a source of might that they may be intercessors before God so that they will not be chastised."
  19,82,"Nay that is to say there is none to prevent their being chastised but they namely the idol gods shall reject their worship that is they will deny it — as is stated in another verse It was not us that they used to worship Q. 2863 — and they shall be pitted against them as opponents enemies supporting one another against them."
  19,83,"Have you not regarded that We unleash the devils against We have set them upon the disbelievers to urge them to incite them to commit acts of disobedience impetuously?"
  19,84,"So do not make haste against them to demand that they receive chastisement. Indeed We are only counting for them the days and the nights or their every breath carefully until the time arrives for their chastisement."
  19,85,"Mention the day on which We shall gather those who fear God by their adherence to faith to the Compassionate One honoured on mounts wafdan the accusative plural of wāfid meaning ‘mounted’;"
  19,86,"and drive the guilty guilty on account of their disbelief into Hell a thirsty herd wirdan the accusative plural of wārid meaning ‘one who is thirsty and on foot."
  19,87,"They namely mankind will not have the power to intercede save him who has made a covenant with the Compassionate One the covenant being the profession of lā ilāha illā’Llāh wa-lā hawla wa-lā quwwata illā bi’Llāh ‘there is no god but God and there is no power or strength except in God’."
  19,88,"And they say that is the Jews and the Christians and those who claim that the angels are God’s daughters ‘The Compassionate One has taken a son’. But God exalted be He says to them"

  19,90,"The heavens are almost read takādu or yakādu rent read takādu tatafattarna by being torn apart a variant reading has yanfatirna because of it and the earth is almost split asunder and the mountains almost fall down crashing collapsing on top of them because of the fact"
  19,91,"that they have ascribed a son to the Compassionate One. God exalted be He says"
  19,92,"when it is not meet for the Majesty of the Compassionate One to take a son that is to say such a thing does not befit Him."
  19,93,"There is none in the heavens and the earth but he comes to the Compassionate One as a servant servile submissive on the Day of Resurrection including individuals such as Ezra and Jesus."
  19,94,"Verily He knows their number and has counted them precisely and therefore the knowledge of their total number does not elude Him not even the knowledge of one of them."
