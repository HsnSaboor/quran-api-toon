  35,4,"And if they deny you O Muhammad (s) with regard to your coming with the message of God’s Oneness resurrection reckoning and punishment verily other messengers before you were denied in this respect so be steadfast as they were steadfast; and to God all matters are returned in the Hereafter when He will requite the deniers and grant victory to the messengers."
  35,5,"O mankind! Indeed God’s promise of resurrection and of other issues is true. So do not let the life of this world deceive you from believing in all of that and do not let the Deceiver Satan deceive you concerning God on account of His forbearance and respiting of sinners in this life."
  35,6,"Truly Satan is an enemy to you. So treat him as an enemy by being obedient to God and do not obey him; he only summons his faction his followers in disbelief so that they may be among the inhabitants of the Blaze the fierce Fire."
  35,7,"Those who disbelieve theirs will be a severe chastisement; but those who believe and perform righteous deeds theirs will be forgiveness and a great reward — this is a declaration of what fate will be for the adherents of Satan and what will be for his opponents respectively."
  35,8,"The following was revealed regarding Abū Jahl and others Is he the evil of whose deeds is made to seem fair to him by distortion so that he deems it good …? a-fa-man ‘is he whose’ constitutes the subject the predicate of which is an omitted ‘like one whom God has guided?’ No! And this predicate is indicated by what follows. Indeed God leads astray whomever He will and guides whomever He will. So do not let your soul expire for their sake for those to whom it has made to seem fair out of sighings by becoming anguished lest they do not believe. Indeed God is Knower of what they do and He will requite them for it."
  35,9,"And it is God Who unleashes the winds al-riyāha a variant reading has al-rīha and they raise clouds fa-tuthīru’l-sahāba the imperfect tense here is used to narrate the past that is they stir them up then We drive them there is a shift here from the third person to the first person address to a dead land read mayyitin or maytin wherein is no plant life and therewith revive the earth of that land after it has been dead after its having been dried-out. In other words We made seeds and grass grow in it Such will be the Raising that is the Resurrection and the bringing of the dead back to life."
  35,10,"Whoever desires glory should know that all glory belongs to God in this world and in the Hereafter and it cannot be obtained from Him except through obedience to Him so let such a one be obedient to Him. To Him ascends good words that is to say He is aware of such good words and these are statements such as ‘there is no god except God’ and the like; and as for righteous action He exalts it He accepts it; but those who plot evil schemes against the Prophet — as was the case at the council assembly in the way of imprisoning him killing him or expelling him as mentioned in sūrat al-Anfāl Q. 830 — theirs shall be a severe chastisement and their plotting shall come to nothing it shall be ruined."
  35,11,"And God created you from dust by having created your father Adam from it then from a drop of seminal fluid in other words from sperm by creating his seed from it; then He made you pairs males and females. And no female bears or brings forth except with His knowledge illā bi-‘ilmihi is a circumstantial qualifier in other words ‘except that it is known by Him’ and no long-living person is given long life in other words the life of none is increased for one who has a long life nor is anything diminished of his life in other words of the life of that same long-living person or some other long-living person but it is recorded in a Book namely the Preserved Tablet. Surely that is easy for God."
