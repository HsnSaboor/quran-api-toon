  16,94,"And do not make your oaths a means of deceit between you — He repeats this here for emphasis — lest a foot should slip that is lest your feet should slip off the path of Islam after being steady having been set upon it and lest you should taste evil that is chastisement forasmuch as you barred people from the way of God in other words for your refraining to fulfil covenants or barring others from doing this since your custom once established will be followed by others and there be a tremendous chastisement for you in the Hereafter."
  16,95,"And do not sell God’s covenant for a small price of this world so that you break it in return for this small price. For truly what is with God of reward is better for you than all that is in this world — if you should know this then do not break it."
  16,96,"That which is with you of the things of this world will come to an end will perish but that which is with God remains it is everlasting. And He shall surely pay read la-yajziyanna or la-najziyanna ‘We shall surely pay’ those who were patient in fulfilling their covenants their reward according to the best of what they used to do ‘the best’ here means ‘the good’."
  16,97,"Whoever acts righteously whether male or female and is a believer him verily We shall revive with a goodly life. This is said to be life in Paradise; or it is life on earth when it is one of contentedness or one of wholesome halāl provision. And We shall surely pay them their reward according to the best of what they used to do."
  16,98,"And when you recite the Qur’ān that is when you intend to recite it seek refuge in God from Satan the outcast in other words say a‘ūdhu bi’Lllāhi min al-shaytān al-rajīm ‘I seek refuge in God from the accursed Satan’."
  16,99,"Indeed he has no power sway over those who believe and put their trust in their Lord."
  16,100,"His Satan’s power is only over those who choose him as their patron by obeying him and those who ascribe partners to Him that is to God."
  16,101,"And when We exchange a verse in place of a different verse by abrogating it and revealing another for the welfare of God’s servants — and God knows best what He reveals — they say that is the disbelievers say to the Prophet s ‘You are just a fabricator’ a liar making it up yourself. Nay most of them do not know the true nature of the Qur’ān and the benefit to God’s servants of abrogation."
  16,102,"Say to them ‘The Holy Spirit Gabriel has revealed it from your Lord with truth bi’l-haqq this is semantically connected to nazzala ‘he Gabriel has revealed it’ to confirm the faith of those who believe by their believing in it when it is revealed and as guidance and good tidings for those who have submitted to God’."
