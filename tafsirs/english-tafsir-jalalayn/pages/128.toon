tafsir[8]{c,v,t}:
  6,1,"Praise which means to describe in beautiful terms be ever established to God is this meant to be informative so that one believes in it? Or is it meant as a eulogy or both? These are three possibilities the most likely of which is the last as the Shaykh Jalāl al-Dīn al-Mahallī states in his commentary on sūrat al-Kahf Q. 181; Who created the heavens and the earth — He singles out these two for mention because for the observer they constitute the most awesome visible creation; and He appointed He created darknesses and light that is every darkness zulma and every light the use of the plural only in the case of the former is because it darkness has many causes; and this is one of the proofs of His Oneness; then those who disbelieve despite the existence of this proof ascribe equals to their Lord they worship others equally."
  6,2,"It is He Who created you from clay by creating your father Adam from it; then He decreed a term for each of you at the conclusion of which you die. A term is stated fixed with Him for your resurrection; yet thereafter you O disbelievers doubt you are uncertain about the Resurrection when you know that it was He Who initiated your creation and One Who has the power to initiate creation is even more capable of bringing you back to life after death."
  6,3,"He is God the One worthy of being worshipped in the heavens and in the earth. He knows your secrets and your utterance what you keep secret and what you utter openly among yourselves and He knows what you earn what you do of good and evil."
  6,4,"Not a verse min āya min introduces a relative clause of the verses of their Lord in the Qur’ān comes to them that is to the Meccans but they turn away from it."
  6,5,"They denied the truth the Qur’ān when it came to them but there shall come to them the news the consequences of what they were mocking."
  6,6,"Have they not seen in their travels to Syria and to other places how many kam is predicative and not interrogative meaning ‘many’ a generation how many a community of past communities We destroyed before them; We established them We assigned them an established place in the earth through strength and abundance as We have not established as We have not assigned you there is a shift in the address here from third person to second; and how We unleashed the heaven the rain upon them in torrents one torrent after another and made the rivers to flow beneath them? beneath their dwellings. Then We destroyed them because of their sins because of their denial of the prophets; and We raised up after them another generation."
  6,7,"And had We revealed to you a Scripture inscribed on parchment as they requested and had they then touched it with their hands — this is more powerful than saying ‘had they seen it with their eyes’ since it touch is more effective in eliminating doubt; the disbelievers would have said in disobedience and obduracy ‘This is nothing but manifest sorcery’."
  6,8,"And they say ‘Why has an angel not been sent down to him?’ to Muhammad (s) to confirm his truthfulness; yet had We sent down an angel as they have requested and if they then did not believe the matter that they be destroyed would have been decreed and then they would not be given any respite they would not be given any extra time for repentance or an excuse as is God’s custom in dealing with those before them destroying them when they disbelieve after their request is granted."
