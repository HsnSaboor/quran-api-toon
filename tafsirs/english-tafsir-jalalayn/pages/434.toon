tafsir[9]{c,v,t}:
  34,49,"Say ‘The truth Islam has come. And falsehood disbelief neither originates nor restores anything’ in other words it leaves no trace of itself behind."
  34,50,"Say ‘If I go astray from the truth I will be going astray only to my own loss that is to say the sin of my going astray shall be held against me; and if I am rightly guided it will have been by what my Lord reveals to me of the Qur’ān and wisdom. Truly He is Hearer of supplications Nigh’."
  34,51,"If you could but see O Muhammad (s) when they are stricken with terror at the Resurrection you would see a dreadful thing and so there is no escape for them from Us that is to say they will not be able to elude Us and they are seized from a close quarter namely from the graves."
  34,52,"And they will say ‘We believe in him now’ in other words in Muhammad (s) — or if read ‘We believe in it’ then in the Qur’ān. But how can they attain it read tanāwush or tanā’ush that is attain faith from a place that is far away from the place for attaining it — as they are now in the Hereafter and the proper place for attaining it was in this world —"
  34,53,"when they disbelieved in it before? in this world. And they throw guesses at the Unseen from a far-off place in other words they make guesses about something the knowledge of which was hidden far away from them as when they would say that the Prophet was a sorcerer or a poet or a soothsayer or that the Qur’ān was sorcery poetry or soothsaying."
  34,54,"And a barrier is set between them and what they crave in the way of faith — in other words their craving to embrace it — just as was done with their counterparts in respect to disbelief formerly in other words before them. Indeed they used to be in grave doubt doubt causing them to have misgivings about that in which they now believe but the proofs for which they never considered in this world."
  35,1,"Praise be to God God praises Himself with in these terms as explained at the beginning of the preceding sūrat Saba’ Originator of the heavens and the earth the One Who created them without any precedent Appointer of the angels as messengers to His prophets having wings in sets of two or three or four. He multiplies in creation in angels and other creatures what He will. Surely God has power over all things."
  35,2,"Whatever mercy God unfolds for mankind in the way of provision or rain none can withhold it; and whatever He withholds thereof none can release it after Him that is after His withholding it. And He is the Mighty Whose way prevails the Wise in what He does."
  35,3,"O people that is the people of Mecca remember God’s grace to you in His making you dwell within the Meccan Sanctuary and preventing raids against you. Is there any creator min khāliqin min is extra; khāliq is the subject other than God read ghayru’Llāhi or gharyri’Llāhi as an adjectival qualification of khāliq ‘creator’ either concording with the oblique form of min khāliqin or concording with the syntactical status thereof; the predicate of the subject is the following who provides for you from the heaven rain and from the earth? vegetation the interrogative is actually an affirmative that is to say ‘there is no creator or provider other than Him. There is no god except Him. So how then do you deviate? how are you turned away from affirming His Oneness when you already affirm that He is the Creator and the Provider?"
