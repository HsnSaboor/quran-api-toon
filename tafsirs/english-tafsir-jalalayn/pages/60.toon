tafsir[6]{c,v,t}:
  3,78,"And there is a group a party of them the People of the Scripture like Ka‘b b. al-Ashraf who twist their tongues with the Book altering it by reciting it not according to the way in which it was revealed but according to the way in which they have distorted it as in the case of the descriptions of the Prophet s and other similar matters; so that you may suppose it such distortion as part of the Book that God revealed; yet it is not part of the Book; and they say ‘It is from God’ yet it is not from God and they speak falsehood against God while they know that they are liars."
  3,79,"When the Christians of Najrān claimed that Jesus had commanded them to take him as a Divinity and some Muslims asked that they should be permitted to prostrate themselves before him the Prophet s the following was revealed It belongs not to any mortal that God should give him the Book the Judgement the understanding of the Divine Law prophethood then that he should say to men ‘Be servants to me instead of God.’ Rather he should say ‘Be masters scholars labouring rabbāniyyūn ‘those of the Lord’ is derived from rabb ‘lord’ with the extra alif and nūn as a superlative of rabbiyyūn by virtue of what you know ta‘lamūn also read as tu‘allimūn ‘you teach’ of the Book and in what you study’ that is on account of the fact that you used to do this for its benefit is that you engage in action."
  3,80,"He would never order you read lā ya’murukum to denote a new clause meaning ‘God would not order you’; or if read lā ya’murakum it would be a supplement to yaqūla ‘he should say’ meaning ‘it belongs not that… a mortal should order you’; to take the angels and the prophets as lords in the way that the Sabaeans have taken the angels the Jews Ezra and the Christians Jesus. Would He order you to disbelieve after you have submitted? He would not do this."
  3,81,"And mention when God made a covenant with the prophets ‘What if read lamā it would be introducing a subject clause and emphasising the aspect of the oath in this ‘making of the covenant’; if it is read limā it would then be connected to the verb akhadha ‘He took’; the mā ‘what’ is a relative particle in both cases meaning la’lladhī or li’lladhī respectively I have given you ātaytukum or in a variant reading ātaynākum ‘We have given you’ of the Book and wisdom; then there shall come to you a messenger confirming what is with you of the Book and wisdom and that is Muhammad (s) — you shall believe in him and you shall help him’ this constitutes the response to the oath if you reach his time and perceive him and their communities of descendants follow them in what is incumbent upon them. He God exalted be He said to them ‘Do you affirm this? And do you take do you accept My load My covenant on you on that condition?’ They said ‘We affirm’. He said ‘Then bear witness to this before your own souls and those of your followers and I shall be with you among the witnesses’ before you and them."
  3,82,"Then whoever turns his back in rejection after that covenant they are the wicked."
  3,83,"What! Do they the ones who turn away desire yabghūna is also read tabghūna ‘do you desire?’ other than God’s religion when to Him has submitted to Him has yielded whoever is in the heavens and the earth willingly without refusal or unwillingly by the sword and by seeing what it such refusal results in and to Him they shall be returned? yurja‘ūna may also be read turja‘ūna ‘you shall be returned’; the hamza at the beginning of the verse a-fa-ghayra ‘what…other’ denotes a disavowal."
