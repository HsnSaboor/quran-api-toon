  12,23,"And she in whose house he was — namely Zulaykhā — attempted to seduce him that is she asked him to lie with her and she closed the doors of the house. And she said to him ‘Come!’ hayta laka the lām of laka is for clarification; a variant reading has hīta laka or haytu laka. ‘God forbid!’ I seek refuge with God from this he said. ‘Truly he who bought me is my lord my master who has given me an honourable place an honourable residence and so I cannot betray him with regard to his family. Truly evildoers fornicators never prosper’."
  12,24,"And she certainly desired him she sought sexual intercourse with him and he would have desired her too he would have sought the same had it not been that he saw the proof of his Lord Ibn ‘Abbās said ‘Jacob was made to appear before him and he struck his Joseph’s breast whereupon his sexual desire withdrew from his body through his fingernails the response to lawlā ‘had it not been’ has been omitted understood to be la-jāma‘ahā ‘he would have lain with her’. So it was that We made him see the proof that We might ward off from him evil betrayal and lewdness the act of fornication. Truly he was of Our devoted servants in terms of obedience mukhlisīn a variant reading has mukhlasīn in other words ‘chosen/purified servants’."

  12,27,"but if his shirt has been torn from behind then she has lied and he is of the truthful’."
