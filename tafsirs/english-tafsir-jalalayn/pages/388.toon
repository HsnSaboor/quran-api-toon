tafsir[7]{c,v,t}:
  28,22,"And when he turned his face towards Midian in the direction thereof — and this Midian was the town of the prophet Shu‘ayb eight day’s journeying from Egypt so named after Midian son of Abraham; he Moses did not know the route to it — he said ‘Perhaps my Lord will show me the right way’ that is to say which route to follow in other words the simplest route to it. God thus sent forth to him an angel with a goat which he Moses set off following towards it the town."
  28,23,"And when he arrived at the Water of Midian the name of a well therein he found a group of people there watering their flocks and he found besides them two women holding back their flock from the water. He Moses said to the two ‘What is your business?’ that is ‘What is the matter with you that you are not watering?’ They said ‘We do not water our flock until the shepherds have moved on ri‘ā’u ‘shepherds’ the plural of rā‘in that is to say until they have returned from the watering for fear of being crushed by the throng after which we go to water a variant reading for yasdiru ‘move on’ is the 4th form subjunctive yusdira ‘to drive away’ meaning until they the shepherds have driven their flocks away from the water’ and our father is a very old man’ unable to come and water."
  28,24,"So he watered their flock for them from another well nearby by lifting a rock from on top of it which only ten men could have lifted; then he retreated to the shade of an acacia tree samura because of the extreme heat of the sun and he was hungry and said ‘My Lord indeed I am in utter need of whatever good whatever food You send down to me’. The two women returned to their father quicker than usual and so he asked them why it was so. They told him about the man who had watered their flock for them. So he said to one of them ‘Summon him to come to me’."
  28,25,"God exalted be He says Then one of the two women came to him walking bashfully — in other words covering her face with the sleeve of her shirt being shy of him — and said ‘My father invites you that he may pay you a wage for watering our flock for us’. He accepted her invitation while inwardly he disapproved of accepting any wage for it was as though she sought to remunerate him and as though he were of those who would want it which he was not. She walked in front of him but when the wind began to blow off her dress and reveal her legs he said to her ‘Walk behind me and show me the way’ which she did. Finally he came to her father Shu‘ayb peace be upon him who was sitting with some supper in front of him. He said to him ‘Sit and have some supper’. He Moses said ‘I hope that this is not some sort of compensation for having watered their flock for them? For we are People of a House and do not demand compensation for good deeds’. He Shu‘ayb said ‘No. It is simply a custom of mine and of my forefathers to be hospitable to guests and to offer them food’. Thus he Moses ate and informed him of his predicament. God exalted be He says So when he came to him and recounted to him the story al-qasas is a verbal noun with the sense of al-maqsūs ‘that which is recounted’ of his slaying of the Egyptian and their intention to slay him and his fear of Pharaoh he their father said ‘Do not be afraid. You have escaped from the evildoing people’ as Pharaoh had no authority over Midian."
  28,26,"One of the two women the one that had been sent by her father either the elder or the younger said ‘O my father hire him employ him in return for a wage that he may tend our flock instead of us. Surely the best man you can hire is the strong the trustworthy man’ in other words hire him on account of his strength and trustworthiness. He Shu‘ayb asked her about him and she told him as mentioned above how he had lifted the rock off the well and that he had said to her ‘Walk behind me’ in addition to his lowering his head when he realised that she was coming towards him refusing to lift it until she left. He Shu‘ayb therefore was keen to have him marry one of his daughters."
  28,27,"He said ‘I desire to marry you to one of these two daughters of mine either the elder or the younger one on condition that you hire yourself to me that you are employed by me to tend my flock for eight years. And if you complete ten that is the tending of ten years that completion shall be of your own accord. I do not want to be hard on you by making it the marriage conditional on ten years service. God willing — expressed to seek God’s blessing — you shall find me to be one of the righteous’ of those who fulfil their covenants."
  28,28,"He Moses said ‘That which you have said is settled then between me and you. Whichever of the two terms the eight or the ten the mā in ayyamā ‘whichever of the two’ is extra in other words the tending thereof I complete there shall be no injustice done to me by demanding of me to do more tending. And God is Guardian Keeper or Witness over what we you and I say’. The contract was agreed in this way. Shu‘ayb bid his daughter to give Moses a staff with which to beat off predatory beasts from his sheep — the staffs of the prophets were in his keeping. It was Adam’s staff made from the myrtle of Paradise that fell into her hands and so Moses took it with Shu‘ayb’s knowledge."
