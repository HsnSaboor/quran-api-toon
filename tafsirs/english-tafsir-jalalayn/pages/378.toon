  27,14,"And they denied them they did not affirm them though in reality their souls had been convinced in other words though they were certain that these signs were from God wrongfully and arrogantly in defiance of believing in what Moses had brought these two adverbs refer back to the cause of their denial. So behold O Muhammad (s) how was the sequel for the agents of corruption a sequel which you know they were destroyed."
  27,15,"And verily We gave David and Solomon his son knowledge of rendering decisive judgement between people and knowledge of the speech of birds and of other things and they said giving thanks to God ‘Praise be to God Who has favoured us with prophethood and the disposal of jinn humans and devils to our service over many of His believing servants’."
  27,16,"And Solomon inherited from David prophethood and knowledge exclusively from among all his other children; and he said ‘O people we have been taught the speech of the birds that is the ability to understand their sounds and we have been given of all things given to prophets and kings. Indeed this gift is the manifest the evident favour’."
  27,17,"And on one journey Solomon’s hosts of jinn and humans and birds stood assembled for him as they were being arrayed brought together in groups and marshalled."
  27,18,"When they came to the Valley of the Ants — which is located either in Tā’if or in Syria and whose ants are either small or large — an ant the queen ant who had seen Solomon’s hosts said ‘O ants enter your dwellings lest Solomon and his hosts crush you while they are unaware!’ — the ants are likened to rational beings in their use of the latter’s speech."
  27,19,"Whereat he Solomon smiled fa-tabassama the beginning of the sentence amused dāhikan the end of the sentence at its words which he had heard from three miles away and which was carried to him by the winds. When he was on the verge of entering their valley he Solomon made his hosts halt until they the ants had entered their dwellings — on this journey his hosts consisted of cavalry and infantry. And he said ‘My Lord inspire me to be thankful for Your grace with which You have favoured me and my parents and to do good that will please You and include me by Your mercy among Your righteous servants’ the prophets and saints."
  27,20,"And he reviewed the birds to see the hoopoe — which would locate water beneath the ground and indicate its location by pecking at it whereupon the devils would extract it for Solomon required it for when he prayed; but he could not see him — then he said ‘Why is it that I do not see the hoopoe? in other words is there something preventing me from seeing him? Or is he among the absent? and so I cannot see him because he is absent?’ And when he became certain of the hoopoe’s absence"
  27,21,"He said ‘Assuredly I will chastise him with a severe chastisement by having all his feathers as well as his tail plucked and leaving him out in the sun where he would not be able to escape from reptiles or I will slaughter him by slitting his throat unless he brings me read la-ya’tiyannī or la-ya’tinannī a clear warrant’ plain manifest proof for his having a valid excuse."
  27,22,"But he did not remain read fa-makutha or fa-makatha long in absence in other words he was away only for a short while and came to Solomon humbly with his head up and his wings and tail lowered. Solomon pardoned him and asked him about what he had encountered during his absence and he said ‘I have discovered something of which you have no knowledge and I have brought you from Sheba this may be read in declined form min Saba’in or left as indeclinable min Saba’a — a tribe in Yemen whose name is taken from the name of one of their ancestors which is also the reason why it may be declined — a verified report."
