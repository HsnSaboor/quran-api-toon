tafsir[10]{c,v,t}:
  24,1,"This is a sūra which We have revealed and prescribed read faradnāhā or the intensive form farradnāhā on account of the large number of prescriptions contained in it and wherein We have revealed manifest signs signs containing clear indications that perhaps you might remember tadhakkarūna the second tā’ of tatadhakkarūna has been assimilated with the dhāl that you might be admonished."
  24,2,"As for the fornicatress and the fornicator that is of those not in wedlock — because those in wedlock are stoned according to the Sunna the al in al-zāniya ‘the fornicatress’ and al-zānī ‘the fornicator’ according to some mentioned opinions is a relative particle; the clause al-zāniyatu wa’l-zānī is a subject and because of its similarity to a conditional the fā’ has been inserted into the predicate which is the following fa’jlidū strike each of them a hundred lashes a hundred strikes one says jaladahu to mean daraba jildahu ‘he struck him on the skin’. According to the Sunna in addition to this punishment there is also banishment for a whole year. The slave however receives half of the mentioned punishment. And do not let any pity for them overcome you in God’s religion that is to say in the fulfilment of His rulings by disregarding any part of their prescribed punishment if you believe in God and the Last Day namely the Day of Resurrection in this statement there is an incitement to abide by what was mentioned before the conditional above and it also constitutes the response to the latter or at least is an indication of the response to it. And let their punishment the flogging be witnessed by a group of the believers — some say that this should be a group of three; some say four as in the number of witnesses testifying to an act of fornication."
  24,3,"The fornicator shall not marry anyone but a fornicatress or an idolatress and the fornicatress shall be married by none except a fornicator or an idolator in other words what is suitable for each of the two for the purposes of marriage is the above-mentioned; and that namely marrying of fornicators is forbidden to believers who are better than those. This was revealed when the poor among the Emigrants resolved to marry the wealthy whores of the idolaters so that they the women would provide for them. Thus it is said that the prohibition applies specifically to them; but it is also said to apply in general; but it was abrogated by God’s words Marry off the spouseless among you Q. 2432."
  24,4,"And those who accuse honourable women in wedlock who are chaste of fornication and then do not bring four witnesses to testify as eyewitnesses to their fornication strike them eighty lashes that is each one of them and do not accept any testimony from them ever in anything; and those they are the immoral for committing a grave sin kabīra;"
  24,5,"except those who repent thereafter and make amends in their deeds for God is indeed Forgiving of their unsubstantiated accusations Merciful to them in inspiring them to make repentance whereby their immorality is curbed and their testimony becomes once again acceptable — some say however that it can never be accepted thereafter if the proviso is taken to refer to the last clause."
  24,6,"And those who accuse their wives of fornication but have no witnesses to substantiate this except themselves — which happened with some Companions — then the testimony of one of them fa-shahādatu ahadihim the subject shall be to testify swearing by God four times araba‘a shahādātin is in the accusative as a verbal noun that he is indeed being truthful in accusing his wife of committing fornication"
  24,7,"and a fifth time that God’s wrath shall be upon him if he were lying in this the predicate of the subject fa-shahādatu ahadihim ‘then the testimony of one of them’ is the implicit ‘will spare him the prescribed legal punishment for false accusation’."
  24,8,"And the punishment namely the prescribed legal punishment for fornication that is established upon his testimony shall be averted from her if she testify swearing by God four times that he is indeed lying in accusing her of having fornicated;"
  24,9,"and a fifth time that God’s wrath shall be upon her if he were being truthful therein."
  24,10,"And were it not for God’s bounty to you and His mercy in shielding you from being exposed in such situations and that God is the Relenting in His acceptance of repentance in such situations and otherwise Wise in the rulings He has given for this and other matters that He might make clear the truth therein and hasten punishment for those deserving it."
