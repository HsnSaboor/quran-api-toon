tafsir[6]{c,v,t}:
  33,1,"O Prophet! Fear God remain in fear of Him and do not obey the disbelievers and the hypocrites and so follow them in what contravenes your Law. Truly God is Knower of what will happens before it happens Wise in what He creates."
  33,2,"And follow what is revealed to you from your Lord namely the Qur’ān. Truly God is Aware of what you do ta‘malūna; a variant reading has ya‘malūna ‘what they do’."
  33,3,"And put your trust in God regarding this affair of yours; and God suffices as Guardian to preserve you. And the members of his the Prophet’s community are subject to the same admonitions in all of the above."
  33,4,"God has not placed two hearts inside any man this was revealed in order to refute those disbelievers who said that they each had two hearts with which they could reason better than Muhammad’s single mind; nor has He made your wives whom read as allā’ī or allā’ you repudiate by zihār read tazzahharūna or tuzāhirūna; the original tā’ of tatazāharūna has been assimilated with the zā’ — a man would say to his wife for example ‘You are for me as untouchable as my mother’s back’ — your mothers in other words He has not made you wives like your mothers so that they are illicit for conjugality in that respect a practice which in pre-Islamic times was considered a valid form of divorce. An atonement with necessary conditions is necessary in such a case as mentioned in sūrat al-Mujādila Q. 582-3. Nor has He made those whom you claim as adopted sons ad‘iyā’ the plural of da‘iyy which is one claimed as the son of one who is not his biological father your sons in reality. That is a mere utterance of your mouths namely of the Jews and the hypocrites. When the Prophet s married Zaynab bt. Jahsh who had been Zayd b. Hāritha’s wife the adopted son of the Prophet s they said ‘Muhammad married his son’s wife!’ and so God proved them liars in this. But God speaks the truth in this matter and He guides to the way the way of truth."
  33,5,"Instead attribute them to their true fathers. That is more equitable that is more just in the sight of God. If you do not know their true fathers then they are your brethren in religion and as your associates. And you would not be at fault for any mistake you make in this respect except in what your hearts may premeditate after the prohibition has been issued. And God is Forgiving of whatever you said before the prohibition was issued Merciful to you in this respect."
  33,6,"The Prophet is closer to the believers than their own souls in terms of what he calls them to and what their own souls have called them to contravene and his wives are their mothers insofar as they the believers are forbidden to marry them. And those related by blood kinsmen are more entitled to inherit from one another in the Book of God than the other believers and the Emigrants in other words than inheriting on account of their sharing faith and the Emigration which had been the case at the beginning of Islam but was then abrogated; barring any favour you may do your friends by making a bequest which is permissible. This namely the abrogation of inheritance on account of shared faith and Emigration by the inheritance on account of kinship is written in the Book — in both instances al-kitāb ‘the Book’ denotes the Preserved Tablet al-lawh al-mahfūz."
