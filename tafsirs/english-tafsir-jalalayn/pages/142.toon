  6,111,"And if We had sent down the angels to them and the dead had spoken with them as they have requested and We had gathered against them all things in droves read qubulan plural of qabīl meaning ‘throng upon throng’ or read qibalan meaning ‘before their very eyes’ and they were witness to your truthfulness yet they would not have believed as God already knows unless God willed that they believe and they did; but most of them are ignorant of this."
  6,112,"And so We have appointed to every Prophet an enemy just as We have appointed these your enemies and this ‘adūwwan ‘an enemy’ is substituted by the following shayātīn ‘devils’ devils the rebels of mankind and jinn who inspire whisper fine speech to each other the falsehood that is disguised as such fine speech in delusion that is in order to delude them; yet had your Lord willed they would never have done it that mutual inspiration. So leave them let the disbelievers be with what they fabricate of disbelief and otherwise of what has been adorned for them — this was revealed before the command to fight them."
  6,113,"And that the hearts of those who do not believe in the Hereafter may incline to it wa-li-tasghā is a supplement to the above ghurūran ‘in delusion’ that is to that fine speech and that they may be pleased with it and that they may acquire earn what they are acquiring of sins and be punished for it."

Say Shall I seek demand other than God as a judge an arbiter between you and me when it is He Who revealed to you the Book the Qur’ān clearly explained? wherein truth is distinguished from falsehood. Those to whom We have given the Scripture the Torah the likes of ‘Abd Allāh b. Salām and his companions know that it is revealed read munzal or munazzal from your Lord in truth; so do not be of the waverers the doubters regarding it this is intended to affirm to the disbelievers that it is the truth."

He is the Hearing of what is said the Knowing of what is done."
  6,116,"If you obey most of those on earth that is the disbelievers they will lead you astray from the way of God from His religion; they follow only supposition when they dispute with you concerning the status of carrion saying ‘What God has killed is more worthy of your consumption than what you kill yourselves!’; they are merely guessing speaking falsehood in this matter."
  6,117,"Your Lord knows best those who stray from His way and He knows well the rightly guided and will requite both of them."
  6,118,"So eat from that over which God’s Name has been invoked that is that which has been sacrificed to His Name if you believe in His signs."
