  40,26,"And Pharaoh said ‘Let me slay Moses — for they used to restrain him from slaying him — and let him call to his Lord to defend him against me. Indeed I fear that he may change your religion involving your worship of me so that you will then follow him in his religion or that he may cause corruption to appear in the land’ by initiating killing and otherwise a variant reading for wa-an ‘and that’ is aw-an ‘or that’; a variant reading for an yuzhira fī’l-ardi’l-fasāda is the impersonal construction an yazhara fī’l-ardi’l-fasādu ‘that corruption may appear in the land’."

If he is lying then his mendacity will be to his own detriment that is the harm resulting from his mendacity will be to his own detriment; but if he is truthful then there will befall you some of that with which he is threatening you in the way of chastisement soon.
