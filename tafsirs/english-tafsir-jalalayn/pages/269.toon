  16,17,"Is He then Who creates — namely God — as he who does not create namely idols so that you associate them with Him in worship? No. Will you not then remember this and so become believers?"
  16,18,"And if you were to count God’s grace you could never reckon it number it precisely let alone be able to give thanks for it. Indeed God is Forgiving Merciful since He bestows graces upon you despite your shortcomings and your acts of disobedience."
  16,19,"And God knows what you keep secret and what you disclose."
  16,20,"And those whom you invoke tad‘ūna or read yad‘una ‘they invoke’ besides God namely the idols do not create anything but are themselves created fashioned from stones and other materials."
  16,21,"They are dead possessing no life amwātun ‘dead’ is a second predicate not living an emphasis and they the idols are not aware when is the time in which they shall be raised that is creatures so how can they be worshipped?

  16,22,"Your God the One deserving of your worship is One God without any equal in terms of His essence or His attributes and this is God exalted He be.

  16,25,"That they may bear at the conclusion of the matter their burdens their sins complete none of them expunged on the Day of Resurrection and also bear some of the burdens of those whom they lead astray without any knowledge because they summoned them to error and they the latter followed them and thus both share in the sin.

  16,26,"Those before them had indeed plotted those such as Nimrod — he built a lofty tower that he might ascend through it to the heavens and wage war against its inhabitants; then God came at He aimed at their edifice from the foundations from the base unleashing against it winds and earthquake which demolished it; and so the roof collapsed upon them from above them that is while they were beneath it and the chastisement came upon them whence they were not aware from a direction which would not have occurred to them alternatively it is said that this description is a simile for demonstrating the thwarting of that which they had settled on in the way of plots against God’s messengers."
