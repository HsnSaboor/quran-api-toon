  2,120,"Never will the Jews be pleased with you neither the Christians not until you follow their creed their religion Say ‘God’s guidance that is Islam is the true guidance’ besides which there is only error. And if you were wa-la-in the lām is for oaths to follow their whims hypothetically speaking whims to which they are calling you after the knowledge the Divine revelation that has come to you you shall have against God neither friend to protect you nor helper to defend you against Him."
  2,121,"Those to whom We have given the Scripture this is the subject of the sentence and who recite it with true recitation that is who recite it as it was revealed haqqa tilāwatihi ‘its true recitation’ is a circumstantial qualifier; haqqa is in the accusative because it is the object of the verbal noun they believe in it this is the predicate this was revealed concerning a group of Ethiopians that presented themselves to the Prophet and accepted Islam; and whoever disbelieves in it that is in the revealed Book by distorting it they shall be the losers because they will be destined for the Fire made everlasting for them."
  2,122,"O Children of Israel remember My favour wherewith I favoured you and that I have preferred you over all the worlds a similar verse has already been mentioned."
  2,123,"And beware of fear a day when no soul shall for another on this Day be requited that is when no soul for another shall be of any avail and no compensation no ransom shall be accepted from it nor any intercession shall benefit it neither shall they be helped against God’s chastisement."
  2,124,"And mention when his Lord tested tried Abraham Ibrāhīm also read Ibrāhām with certain words with certain commands and prohibitions with which He charged him it is said that these included the rituals of the Pilgrimage the rinsing of the mouth snuffing up water into the nostrils to clean them cleaning of the teeth trimming facial hair combing of the hair trimming the fingernails shaving armpit and pubic hair circumcision and washing one’s private parts after elimination; and he fulfilled them he performed them thoroughly; He God exalted said to him ‘I make you a leader an exemplar in religion for the people.’ Said he ‘And of my seed?’ my progeny make leaders from among them; He said ‘My covenant of leadership shall not reach the evildoers’ the disbelievers from among them this indicates that the covenant will reach only those who are not evildoers."
  2,125,"And when We appointed the House the Ka‘ba to be a place of visitation to which they flock from every direction for the people and a sanctuary of safety for them from the injustice and attacks that befall other places a person could come across his father’s killer there and yet not act violently against him; and ‘Take ittakhidhū is also read ittakhadhū making it a predicate O people to yourselves Abraham’s station the founding stone he used when building the House for a place of prayer’ so that you perform two units of prayer for the circumambulation; And We made a covenant with Abraham and Ishmael We commanded them ‘Purify My House of graven images for those that shall go round it and those that cleave to it in ritual residence to those who bow and prostrate themselves’ that is those who pray al-rukka‘ and al-sujūd are the plurals of rāki‘ ‘one bowing’ and sājid ‘one prostrated’ respectively."
  2,126,"And when Abraham said ‘My Lord make this place a land secure in which there is safety God granted him his request making it a sanctuary in which no human blood is shed no injustice is committed towards anyone no prey is hunted and which is never deserted in any of its parts; and provide its people with fruits something which actually happened when there came itinerants from as far as Syria whereas before it had been devoid of any vegetation or water; such of them as believe in God and the Last Day’ this phrase stands in place of its people and they are here singled out for mention in the request in accordance with God’s saying My covenant shall not reach the evildoers; He exalted said ‘And whoever disbelieves I will also provide with fruits to him I shall give enjoyment read either umti‘uhu or umatti‘uhu by granting him sustenance in this life a little the length of his life but then I shall compel him I shall drive him in the Hereafter to the chastisement of the Fire so that he cannot find an escape — how evil a journey’s end!’ a place to which to return."
