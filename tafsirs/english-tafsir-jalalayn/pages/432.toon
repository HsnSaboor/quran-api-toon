  34,33,"And those who were oppressed will say to those who were arrogant ‘Nay but it was your scheming night and day in other words such were your schemes against us during both of these times when you used to command us to disbelieve in God and set up partners with Him’. And they that is the two parties will conceal their remorse for not having believed in Him when they see the chastisement in other words each person will hide it his remorse from the next for fear of being reviled; and We will place fetters around the necks of the disbelievers while they are in the Fire. Shall they be requited except the requital for what they used to do? in the world."
