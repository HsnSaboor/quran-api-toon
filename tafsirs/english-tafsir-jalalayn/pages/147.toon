tafsir[4]{c,v,t}:
  6,143,"Eight pairs types thamāniyata azwājin substitutes for hamūlatan wa-farshan ‘some for burdens and some for light support’ two of sheep a male and a female; and of goats read ma‘az or ma‘z two. Say O Muhammad (s) to those who on one occasion deem male cattle forbidden and on another the females thereof and then ascribe such rules to God ‘Is it the two males of the sheep and goats He has forbidden you or the two females of these two types or that which the wombs of the two females contain be they male or female? Inform Me with knowledge of the details of such prohibitions if you speak truly’ in this matter meaning on what basis has the prohibition been made? If it is on the basis of maleness then all males are forbidden; if on the basis of femaleness then all females are so forbidden; if on what the womb may contain then both genders are prohibited. So on what basis are such specifications made? the interrogative is meant as a repudiation."
  6,144,"And of the camels two and of the oxen two. Say ‘Is it the two males He has forbidden or the two females? Or what the wombs of the two females contain? Or were you witnesses present when God charged you with this? prohibition such that you use it to support your claims? Nay! You speak lies in this matter. Then who that is none does greater evil than he who invents a lie against God in this matter that he may lead mankind astray without any knowledge? Truly God does not guide evildoing folk’."
  6,145,"Say ‘I do not find in what is revealed to me anything forbidden to him who eats thereof except it be read yakūn or takūn carrion maytatan; or if read maytatun then with the form yakūn ‘it be’ preceding it or blood poured forth flowing as opposed to the case of a liver or a spleen; or the flesh of swine — that indeed is an abomination forbidden or except it be a wicked thing that has been hallowed to other than God that is to say it has been slaughtered in the name of someone else. But whoever is constrained to do any of what has been mentioned and he consumes it neither coveting nor transgressing then surely your Lord is Forgiving to him for what he has consumed Merciful’ towards him. To these prohibited things the Sunna adds all beasts of prey with canine teeth and birds of prey with talons."
  6,146,"And to those of Jewry that is the Jews We forbade every beast with hoof that is every animal which does not have divided toes such as camels and ostriches; and of oxen and sheep We forbade them the fat of them the thin fat lining the stomach and the fat of the kidneys save what their backs carry that is what fat is attached to it or what is carried by their entrails their intestines hawāyā is the plural of hāwiyā’ or hāwiya or what is mingled with bone thereof which is the fat of the rump these were lawful for them; that prohibition We requited them with for their insolence on account of their wrongdoing as already mentioned in sūrat al-Nisā’ Q. 4160; verily We are truthful in recounting Our tidings and Our appointed times."
