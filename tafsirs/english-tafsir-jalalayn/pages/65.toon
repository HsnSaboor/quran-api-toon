tafsir[6]{c,v,t}:
  3,116,"As for the disbelievers their riches shall not avail protect them neither their children against God that is against His chastisement these two are singled out for mention because a person usually avails himself either by paying a ransom or by resorting to the help of his children; those are the inhabitants of the Fire abiding therein."
  3,117,"The likeness the description of what they the disbelievers expend in the life of this world in the way of enmity towards the Prophet or in the way of voluntary almsgiving or the like is as the likeness of a wind wherein is a blast of extreme hot or cold that smote the tillage the crops of a people who have wronged themselves through unbelief and disobedience and destroyed it so that they could not profit from it; so it is with what they expend it perishes and they profit nothing from it. God did not wrong them when they lost what they expended but they wronged themselves through unbelief which necessitated this loss."
  3,118,"O you who believe do not take as intimates as sincere friends revealing to them your secret thoughts anyone apart from yourselves from among the Jews Christians and the hypocrites; such men spare nothing to ruin you khabālan is in the accusative because the preposition that usually precedes it sc. fī’l-khabāl has been omitted that is to say they would not be remiss about corrupting you; they would love they wish for you to suffer al-‘anat means extreme hardship. Hatred enmity towards you is revealed it is manifested by their mouths by sowing discord among you and informing the idolaters of your secret plans; and what their breasts conceal of enmity is yet greater. Now We have made clear to you the signs of their enmity; if you understand this then do not befriend them."
  3,119,"Lo hā ‘lo!’ is for calling attention to something there you are O believers you love them on account of their kinship and their pretence of friendship towards you but they love you not since they oppose you in religion; you believe in the Book all of it that is to say in the Books all of them but they do not believe in your Book and when they meet you they say ‘We believe’ but when they are alone they bite at you their fingertips in rage in extreme fury at what they see of your mutual affection the biting of the fingertips is used to figuratively express the severity of rage even if there be no biting involved. Say ‘Perish in your rage that is be this way until the end of your lives for you shall not see what will please you; God knows what is in the breasts’ what is in the hearts including that which these conceal."
  3,120,"If good fortune a favour such as victory or booty befalls you it is evil for them it grieves them; but if evil such as defeat or drought befalls you they rejoice thereat the conditional statement here is semantically connected to the previous conditional and what comes in between is a parenthetical statement the meaning being that their enmity towards you is endless so why do you befriend them? Avoid them! Yet if you endure their harm and fear God by not befriending them and so on their guile will not hurt you read either lā yadirkum or lā yadurrukum at all; God encompasses what they do ya‘malūn or may be read ta‘malūn ‘what you do’ He has knowledge of it and will requite them for it."
  3,121,"And mention O Muhammad (s) when you went forth at dawn from your family at Medina to assign the believers to have them occupy their places stations for them to stand at for battle and God hears what you say knows your circumstances this was the day of the battle of Uhud. The Prophet s set out with 1000 or 950 men while the idolaters numbered 3000. The Prophet pitched camp at the ravine on Saturday 7th of Shawwāl in year 3 of the Hijra. He had his back and that of his troops to Uhud. He arranged their lines and placed a group of archers under the command of ‘Abd Allāh b. Jubayr at the foot of the mountain and said to them ‘Defend us with your arrows in case they come up from behind us and remain here whether we are being defeated or on the verge of victory’."
