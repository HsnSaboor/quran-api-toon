  22,31,"being hanīfs to God being of those who have submitted to God inclining away from every religion except His religion not ascribing partners to Him this clause emphasises the preceding one both clauses being circumstantial qualifiers referring to the third person plural indicator wāw of ijtanibū ‘avoid’. For whoever ascribes partners to God it is as though he had fallen from the heaven and been snatched away by vulture birds that is as though they had seized him swiftly or as though the wind had blown him dropped him into a far-off place so that there is no hope of his being saved."
  22,32,"That dhālika an implied subject al-amru ‘the matter is’ is taken to precede this predicate. And whoever venerates the sacraments of God then that in other words then that veneration of them — namely of the beasts of sacrifice offered in the Sanctuary after the best of them have been selected and fattened — derives from the piety of the hearts of those individuals. These sacraments are called sha‘ā’ir because they are marked out ish‘ār with something to indicate that they are offerings such as having a hump pierced with a piece of metal."
  22,33,"You may benefit from them such as riding on them and carrying your loads on them in a way that does not harm them until a specified time the time for its immolation. Thereafter its lawful sacrifice that is the site where its immolation becomes due is by the Ancient House meaning the entire Meccan Sanctuary."
  22,34,"And for every community that is for every believing group that came before you We have appointed a holy rite read mansakan as the verbal noun ‘ritual’ or mansikan as a noun denoting the site for a rite in other words for every community We have appointed a sacrificial slaughter or the site for such a ritual that they might mention God’s Name over the livestock that He has provided them at the point of slaughtering them. For your God is One God so submit yield to Him. And give good tidings to the humbly obedient"
  22,35,"who when God is mentioned their hearts tremble fear and who endure patiently whatever may befall them of ordeals and who observe prayer at its appointed times and who from that which We have provided them expend from it give voluntary alms."
  22,36,"And as for the sacrificial camels al-budn plural of badana which are ‘camels’ — We have appointed them for you as one of God’s sacraments the ritual ceremonies of His religion. There is good for you in them benefit for you in this world as already mentioned and a reward in the Hereafter. So mention God’s Name over them at the point of immolating them when they are lined up standing on three legs with the left foreleg hobbled. Then when their flanks have collapsed fallen to the ground after immolation — which is the time when one may eat of them — eat of them if you wish and feed the self-contained beggar al-qāni‘ a beggar who is content with what he is given neither asking nor approaching people and the suppliant al-mu‘tarr a beggar who asks for charity or approaches people for that purpose. So that is similar to such a disposal We have disposed them for you that it may be immolated or ridden — for otherwise it would not have been possible — that perhaps you might be thankful for My graces to you."
  22,37,"Neither their flesh nor their blood shall reach God that is neither of these shall be raised up to Him; rather it is your piety that shall reach Him that is it is your righteous action performed purely for Him together with your faith that shall be raised up to Him. Thus has He disposed them for you that you may magnify God for His guiding you for His pointing out to you the ritual ceremonies of His religion and the rites of His pilgrimage. And give good tidings to the virtuous namely those who affirm the Oneness of God."
  22,38,"Indeed God protects those who believe against the ruinous misguidance of idolaters. Indeed God does not love the treacherous with regard to what is entrusted to him the ungrateful for His grace — these are the idolaters —in other words He will punish them."
