Verily I am God’ Q. 279 — from the right side of the Mount al-Tūr is actually the name of a mountain that is from the side to the right of Moses as he was approaching the Mount from Midian; and We brought him near in communion as God exalted be He made him hear His speech."
  19,53,"And We gave him out of Our mercy Our grace his brother Aaron Hārūn either a substitution for akhāhu ‘his brother’ or an explicative supplement thereof likewise a prophet nabiyyan a circumstantial qualifier constituting the import of the ‘gift’ to Moses which was in response to his Moses’s request that He God send forth his brother with him; he Aaron was older in years than him."
  19,54,"And mention in the Book Ishmael. Indeed he was true to his promise — he never promised anything which he did not fulfil; he once waited for three days for someone whom he had promised to meet; or it is said that he waited an entire year until that person finally returned to the place in which he Ishamel was supposed to have met the former; and he was a messenger to the tribe of Jurhum a prophet likewise."

  19,58,"Those ūlā’ika is the subject to whom God has been gracious alladhīna an‘ama’Llāhu ‘alayhim is an adjectival qualification of it of the subject from among the prophets mina’l-nabīyyīna an explication of it of the subject functioning like an adjectival qualification in terms of import. That which follows it mina’l-nabīyyīna ‘from among the prophets’ up to where the conditional sentence begins constitutes an adjectival qualification of al-nabīyyīna ‘the prophets’; and so His saying …  of the seed of Adam namely Idrīs and of those whom We carried with Noah in the Ark namely Abraham — who is the son of his Noah’s son Shem Sām — and of the seed of Abraham namely Ishmael Isaac and Jacob and of the seed of Israel — who is Jacob — namely Moses Aaron Zachariah John and Jesus and from among those whom We guided and chose that is to say from among their number the predicate of ūlā’ika ‘those’ is the following idhā tutlā … when the signs of the Compassionate One were recited to them they would fall down prostrating and weeping these sujjadan and bukīyyan constitute the plural forms of sājid ‘prostrate’ and bākin ‘weeping’ respectively in other words what is meant is be you like them bukiyyun is originally formed from bakūyyin but the wāw is changed into a yā’ and the damma vowel into a kasra."
  19,59,"But there succeeded after them a posterity who neglected the prayer by abandoning performance of it a posterity such as the Jews and the Christians and followed their lusts in the way of acts of disobedience.

  19,63,"That is the Paradise which We shall give as inheritance which We shall grant and in which We shall lodge those of Our servants who are God-fearing through their obedience of Him."
  19,64,"When the Revelation did not come for a number of days the Prophet s said to Gabriel ‘What prevents you from visiting us more often than you do?’ and so the following was revealed And We do not descend except by the commandment of your Lord.
