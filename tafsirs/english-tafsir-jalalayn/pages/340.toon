tafsir[8]{c,v,t}:
  22,65,"Have you not seen realised that God has disposed for you all that is in the earth of beasts and that the ships run upon the sea for transport and to carry loads by His command by His leave and He holds back the heaven lest it should fall on the earth save when it may do so by His leave and you are destroyed. Surely God is with mankind Gentle Merciful in disposing things for them and holding others back from them."
  22,66,"And He it is Who gave you life by originating you then He will cause you to die upon the conclusion of your terms of life then He will give you life again at the Resurrection. Truly man that is truly the idolater is very ungrateful for God’s graces by neglecting to affirm His Oneness."
  22,67,"For every community We have appointed a holy rite read mansakan or mansikan a Holy Law which they are to observe which they are to implement. So do not let them dispute with you the intended meaning is ‘do not dispute with them’ about the matter namely the matter of the slaughter animal when they said ‘What God has killed is worthier for you to eat than what you killed’; but summon people to your Lord to His religion. Indeed you follow a straight guidance a straight religion."
  22,68,"And if they dispute with you in the matter of religion say ‘God knows best what you do and will requite you for it — this was revealed before the command to fight them."
  22,69,"God will judge between you O believers and disbelievers on the Day of Resurrection concerning that wherein you used to differ’ when each of the two parties would say the opposite of what the other said."
  22,70,"Do you not know the interrogative here is meant as an affirmative that God knows all that is in the heaven and the earth? Truly that which has been mentioned is recorded in a Book namely the Preserved Tablet al-lawh al-mahfūz. Indeed that namely the knowledge of what has been mentioned is easy for God."
  22,71,"And they the idolaters worship besides God that namely idols for which He has never revealed any warrant any definitive proof and that of which they have no knowledge when they claim that these are gods. And those who do evil by way of practising idolatry shall have no helper to protect them against God’s chastisement."
  22,72,"And when Our signs in the Qur’ān are recited to them though they are clear manifest signs bayyinātin a circumstantial qualifier you perceive on the faces of those who disbelieve denial that is to say denial of these signs in other words you perceive the effect of such denial in the way of aversion and frowning. They would almost pounce upon those who recite Our signs to them that is they would almost fall upon them in assault. Say ‘Shall I inform you about something worse than that? something more repulsive to you than the Qur’ān that is being recited to you? It is The Fire! God has promised it to the disbelievers in that their journey’s end shall be to it. And it is an evil journey’s end!’"
