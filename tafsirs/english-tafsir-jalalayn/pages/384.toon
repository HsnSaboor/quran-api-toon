tafsir[12]{c,v,t}:
  27,77,"And truly it is a guidance from error and a mercy for believers from chastisement."
  27,78,"Surely your Lord will decide between them as He will with others on the Day of Resurrection of His judgement that is His justice. And He is the Mighty the Victor the Knower of what He judges so that none will be able to oppose Him in the way that the disbelievers have opposed His prophets in this world."
  27,79,"So rely on God trust in Him for you are indeed upon the manifest truth upon the manifest religion the sequel shall be in your favour with victory over the disbelievers. God then draws comparisons between them and the dead the deaf and the blind saying"
  27,80,"Indeed you cannot make the dead hear nor can you make the deaf hear the call when al-du‘ā’a idhā read by pronouncing both hamzas or by not pronouncing the second one eliding it with the yā’ they have turned their backs upon you;"
  27,81,"nor can you lead the blind out of their error. You can only make those hear — hear so as to comprehend and accept — who believe in Our signs — the Qur’ān — and have therefore submitted are therefore sincere in their affirmation of God’s Oneness."
  27,82,"And when the word of judgement falls upon them when they deserve that chastisement befalls them as well as all other disbelievers We shall bring forth for them a beast from the earth which shall speak to them saying that is which shall speak in Arabic to those who are alive at the time when it appears among its other statements it will say to them on Our behalf ‘Indeed mankind read tukallimuhum inna’l-nāsa; a variant has tukallimuhum bi-anna’l-nāsa ‘to tell them that mankind’ had no faith in Our signs’ in other words they did not believe in the Qur’ān and what it comprises of the mention of resurrection reckoning and requital. With its the beast’s appearance the enjoining of decency and forbidding of indecency will cease and thereafter no disbeliever will believe — just as God revealed to Noah when He said to him None of your people will believe except he who has already believed Q. 1136."
  27,83,"And mention the day when We shall gather from every community a group of those who denied Our signs namely their leaders the ones whom they followed and they will be set in array assembled with the last of them brought together with the first and then led away"
  27,84,"until when they arrive at the site of the Reckoning He exalted be He shall say to them ‘Did you deny My prophets by denying My signs without comprehending them from the perspective of your denial in knowledge or what ammā the interrogative mā has been assimilated with am ‘or’ was it dhā is a relative pronoun in other words it is in fact mā alladhī that you did? with the commands given to you."
  27,85,"And the word of judgement shall fall the chastisement will be due upon them because of the evil they committed that is because of what they associated with God and they will not speak since they will have no valid argument."
  27,86,"Do they not see that We made We created the night that they like others may rest in it and the day for sight? meaning for people to see in it so that they may go about their business therein. Surely in that there are signs indications of His power exalted be He for a people who believe — they the believers are singled out for mention because they benefit from such signs in their faith in contrast to the disbelievers."
  27,87,"And the day when the Trumpet will be blown the Horn will be blown the First Blast by the archangel Isrāfīl and whoever is in the heavens and the earth will be terrified that is a fright that brings about death — as is stated in another verse and whoever is in the heavens and whoever is in the earth will swoon Q. 3968 the past tense fazi‘a is used to express the fact that such events will have occurred; except whom God will namely Gabriel Michael Isrāfīl and the Angel of Death. According to Ibn ‘Abbās however these excepted individuals are the martyrs who are described as living with their Lord provided for by Him’ Q. 3169. And all kullun the nunation compensates for the missing genitive annexation in other words and every one of them after being brought back to life on the Day of Resurrection will come to Him read in the form of the verb atawhu or the active participle ātūhu in utter humility humbled the past tense atawhu is used to express the fact that this will have happened."
  27,88,"And you see the mountains you notice them at the moment of the Blast supposing them to be still stationary in their place because of their tremendous size while they drift like passing clouds like the drifting of the rain when it is blown around by the wind in other words they the mountains will be drifting in like manner until they eventually fall to the ground whereby they are flattened before becoming like tufts of ‘wool’ cf. Q. 1015 and then ‘scattered dust’ cf. Q. 566. God’s handiwork sun‘a a verbal noun emphasising the import of the preceding sentence and which has been annexed in a genitive construction to its agent Allāhi ‘God’ after the omission of its operator Who has perfected everything that He has made. Truly He is aware of what you do taf‘alūna; or read yaf‘alūna ‘what they do’ namely His enemies what they do in the way of disobedience and His friends in the way of obedience."
