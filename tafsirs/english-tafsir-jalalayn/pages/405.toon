  30,6,"The promise of God wa‘da’Llāhi is the verbal noun substituting for the full verbal construction; it is actually wa‘adahumu’Llāhu al-nasr ‘God promised them victory’. God does not fail His promise of such help but most people namely the disbelievers of Mecca are not aware of His promise to help them to victory."
  30,7,"They know merely an outward aspect of the life of this world that is to say its various means of securing livelihood such as commerce agriculture construction and cultivation and so on; but they of the Hereafter they are oblivious this repetition of hum ‘they’ is for emphasis."
  30,8,"Have they not contemplated themselves? so that they might emerge from their oblivion. God did not create the heavens and the earth and what is between them except with the truth and an appointed term for that creation at the conclusion of which this creation will perish and after which will be the Resurrection. But indeed many people that is to say such as the Meccan disbelievers disbelieve in the encounter with their Lord that is they do not believe in resurrection after death."
  30,9,"Have they not travelled in the land and beheld how was the consequence for those before them? of past communities which was that they were destroyed for denying their messengers. They were more powerful than them — such were ‘Ād and Thamūd — and they effected the land they tilled it and churned it up to sow crops and cultivate trees and developed it more than these the Meccan disbelievers have developed it; and their messengers brought them clear signs manifest proofs for God would never wrong them by destroying them without being guilty but they used to wrong themselves by denying their messengers."
  30,10,"Then the consequence for those who committed evil was evil al-sū’ā is the feminine form of al-aswa’ ‘the worst’; it may be read as the predicate of kāna if one reads ‘āqibatu in the nominative; or it is the subject of kāna if read as ‘āqibata in the accusative; and so what is meant is Hell in the former reading or according to the latter reading simply their evil actions because they denied the signs of God the Qur’ān and made a mock of them."
  30,11,"God originates creation in other words He produces the creation of mankind then He will reproduce it that is the creation of them after their death then to Him you shall be returned read turja‘ūna; or yurja‘ūna ‘they shall be returned’."
  30,12,"And on the Day when the Hour comes the sinners will be dumbfounded the idolaters will be fall into silence as their line of argument can no longer be continued."
  30,13,"And none from among those partners of theirs those whom they ascribed as partners of God namely the idols to intercede for them shall be intercessors for them and they shall disavow these partners of theirs in other words they shall dissociate from them."
  30,14,"And on the Day when the Hour comes that day yawma’idhin is repeated for emphasis they believers and disbelievers shall be separated."
  30,15,"As for those who believed and performed righteous deeds they shall be made happy in a garden of Paradise."
