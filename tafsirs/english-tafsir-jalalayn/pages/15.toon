tafsir[8]{c,v,t}:
  2,94,"Say to them ‘If the Abode of the Hereafter that is Paradise with God is purely yours that is exclusively and not for other people as you allege then long for death — if you speak truly’ here both conditionals are connected to the verb tamannū ‘long for’ so that the first is dependent upon the second in other words ‘If you speak truly when you claim that it is yours then you will naturally incline to what is yours and since the path to it is death long for it death’."
  2,95,"But they will never long for it because of that which their own hands have sent before them as a result of their rejection of the Prophet s the consequence of their mendacity. God knows the evildoers the disbelievers and He will requite them."
  2,96,"And you shall find them the lām of la-tajidannahum is for oaths the people most covetous of life and more covetous of it than the idolaters who reject the idea of the Resurrection for the former know that their journey’s end will be the Fire while the idolaters do not believe even in this; any one of them would love wishes that he might be given life for a thousand years law yu‘ammar ‘if only he might be given life’ the particle law ‘if only’ relates to the verbal noun and functions with the sense of an ‘that’ and together with its relative clause explains the implicit verbal noun in the object of the verb yawaddu ‘he would love’; yet any one of them his being given life an yu‘ammara ‘that he should be given life’ constitutes the subject of the verb muzahzihihi ‘that it should budge him’ this verb comes later as though it were ta‘mīruhu ‘the giving of life to him’ shall not budge remove him from the chastisement of the Fire. God sees what they do ya‘malūna may be alternatively read ta‘malūna ‘you do’ and will requite them. ‘Abd Allāh Ibn Sūryā asked the Prophet s or ‘Umar b. al-Khattāb about which angel brings down the revelation and he replied that it was Gabriel; he Ibn Sūryā then said ‘He is our enemy because he brings chastisement with him; had it been Michael we would have believed in him because he brings fertility and security.’ Then the following was revealed"
  2,97,"Say to them ‘Whoever is an enemy to Gabriel let him die in exasperation — he it was that brought it the Qur’ān down upon your heart by the leave by the command of God confirming what was before it of scriptures a guidance from error and good tidings of Paradise for the believers."
  2,98,"Whoever is an enemy to God and His angels and His messengers and Gabriel read Jibrīl or Jabrīl Jibra’il or Jabra’il Jibra’īl or Jabra’īl and Michael Mīkāl also read Mīkā’īl or Mīkā’il; a supplement to malā’ikatihi ‘His angels’ an example of the specific being supplemented to the collective — then surely God is an enemy to the disbelievers’ He says ‘to the disbelievers’ instead of ‘to them’ in order to point out their status."
  2,99,"And We have revealed to you O Muhammad (s) clear proofs lucid ones bayyinātin ‘clear proofs’ is a circumstantial qualifier; this was in response to Ibn Sūryā saying to the Prophet s ‘You have not brought us anything’; and none disbelieves in them except the wicked these have disbelieved in them."
  2,100,"Why whenever they make a covenant with God that they will believe in the Prophet s when he appears or that they will not give assistance to the idolaters against the Prophet s does a party of them reject it? cast it away repudiating it this is the response to the clause beginning with kullamā the interrogative of rebuke. Nay bal indicates a transition but most of them are disbelievers."
  2,101,"When there came to them a messenger from God namely Muhammad (s) confirming what was with them a party of them who were given the Scripture have cast away the Scripture of God that is the Torah behind their backs that is to say they have not acted according to what it said about belief in the Messenger and otherwise; as though they did not know what is contained in it to the effect that he is a true Prophet or that it is the Book of God."
