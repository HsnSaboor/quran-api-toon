  5,14,"And with those who say ‘We are Christians’ this is semantically connected to what follows We made a covenant just as We did with the Children of Israel the Jews and they have forgotten a portion of that they were reminded of in the Gospel pertaining to faith and other matters and they too broke the covenant. So We have stirred up We have caused among them enmity and hatred until the Day of Resurrection on account of their schisms and differing whims each sect charging the other with unbelief; and God will assuredly tell them in the Hereafter of what they wrought and requite them for this."
  5,15,"O People of the Scripture Jews and Christians now there has come to you Our Messenger Muhammad (s) making clear to you much of what you used to conceal of the Scripture the Torah and the Gospel such as the ‘stoning’ verse and the description of the Prophet Muhammad (s) and pardoning much of it which he does not reveal since this would not be of any benefit serving only to disgrace you. There has verily come to you from God a light namely the Prophet s and a Book a Qur’ān lucid plain and manifest"
  5,16,"whereby that is the Book by which God guides whoever follows His good pleasure by believing to the ways of peace the paths of safety and brings them forth from the shadows from unbelief into the light into belief by His leave by His will and He guides them to a straight path the religion of Islam."
  5,17,"They indeed are disbelievers those who say ‘God is the Messiah son of Mary’ insofar as they make him Jesus a god and these were the Jacobites a Christian sect. Say ‘Who then can do anything who then can defend against the chastisement of God if He desires to destroy the Messiah son of Mary and his mother and all those who are on earth?’ that is to say none can do anything of the sort since if Jesus were a god he would be able to do so. And to God belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them. He creates what He will. God has power over everything which He wills."
