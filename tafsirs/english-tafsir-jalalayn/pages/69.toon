  3,149,"O you who believe if you obey the disbelievers in what they command you they will make you turn back on your heels back to unbelief and you will revert as losers."
  3,150,"Nay but God is your Protector your Helper and He is the best of helpers so obey only Him and not them."
  3,151,"We will cast terror read ru‘b or ru‘ub into the hearts of the disbelievers after departing from Uhud they resolved to return in order to exterminate the Muslims but they were terrified and did not return; for what they have associated because of their associating with God that for which He has revealed no warrant that is no argument in support of its worship namely idols; their abode shall be the Fire; evil is the abode the resting place of the evildoers the disbelievers."
  3,152,"God has been true to His promise towards you of giving you victory when you slew them by His leave by His will until you lost heart until you shrank from battle and quarrelled disagreed over the command that is the command of the Prophet s that you remain at the foot of the mountain for the arrow attack some of you saying ‘Let us depart for our comrades have been given victory’ others saying ‘We should not disobey the command of the Prophet s’; and you disobeyed his command and abandoned your station in search of the booty after He God had shown you what you longed for of assistance the response to the clause containing idhā is indicated by what precedes it that is to say ‘when you lost heart He denied you His assistance’. Some of you desired this world abandoning his station for the sake of the booty; and some of you desired the Hereafter holding to it until he was slain such as ‘Abd Allāh b. Jubayr and his companions. Then He turned you away thumma sarafakum is a supplement to the response of the clause containing idhā implied to be raddakum bi’l-hazīma ‘He turned you back in defeat’ from them the disbelievers so that He might try you that He might test you and so make manifest the sincere ones from those otherwise; yet now He has pardoned you what you have done and God is Bounteous to the believers with pardon."
  3,153,"Remember when you were ascending fleeing in the distance not turning around not stopping for anyone and the Messenger was calling you from your rear saying ‘Come to me servants of God this way servants of God!’ so He rewarded you He requited you with grief through defeat for grief ghamman bi-ghamm; the bā’ bi- ‘with’ is said to mean ‘alā ‘for’ because of the grief that you caused the Prophet when you disobeyed his command that is with grief doubled being in addition to the grief of the booty forfeited so that li-kaylā is semantically connected either to ‘afā ‘He has pardoned’ or athābakum ‘He rewarded you’; the lā of kay-lā is thus extra you might not grieve for what escaped you of booty neither for what befell you of being slain and of defeat; and God is aware of what you do."
