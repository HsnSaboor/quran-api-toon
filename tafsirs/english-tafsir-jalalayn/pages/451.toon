  37,127,"But they denied him. So they will indeed be arraigned in the Fire"

  37,129,"and We left for him among posterity fair praise namely"
  37,130,"‘Peace from Us be to Elias!’. It is said that this ilyāsīn is the same Elias mentioned above; but it is also said that this denotes him together with all those who were believers with him and so they have been coupled under the same term with him being the predominant as when one might say al-Muhallabūn ‘the Muhallabids’ to mean al-Muhallab and his folk; a variant reading has āl yāsīn by which is meant his family as well as Elias himself."

  37,139,"And indeed Jonah was one of the messengers;"
  37,140,"when he fled to the laden ship — after he became furious with his people as the chastisement which he had promised them did not come down on them; so he boarded the ship which then stopped out in the deep sea. The seamen said ‘There is a runaway slave here upon this ship who has fled from his master a casting of lots should expose him!’"
  37,141,"Then he drew lots with the passengers on the ship and was of those rejected of the losers in the draw and so they threw him into the sea."
  37,142,"Then the whale swallowed him while he was blameworthy that is while he was guilty of a blameworthy thing having gone to sea and embarked the ship without his Lord’s permission."
  37,143,"And had he not been one of those who glorify God that is to say those who make remembrance of God for inside the whale’s belly he was repeatedly saying the words ‘There is no god except You. Glory be to You! I have indeed been one of the wrongdoers’ Q. 2187"
  37,144,"he would have tarried in its belly until the day when they are raised in other words the whale’s belly would have been his tomb until the Day of Resurrection."

  37,149,"So ask them inquire of the Meccan disbelievers by way of reproach are daughters to be for your Lord after their claim that the angels were God’s daughters while sons are to be for them? so that the best becomes exclusively theirs?"
  37,150,"Or did We create the angels females while they were witnesses? to Our act of creation that they might then say such a thing?"
  37,151,"Lo! it is indeed out of their own mendacity their own lies that they say"
  37,152,"‘God has begotten’ when they say that the angels are God’s daughters. And verily they are liars in this respect."
  37,153,"Has He preferred daughters to sons? read a’stafā ‘has He preferred’ indicating an interrogative hamza which stands in place of the omitted conjunctive hamza."
