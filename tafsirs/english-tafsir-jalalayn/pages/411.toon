tafsir[11]{c,v,t}:
  31,1,"Alif lām mīm God knows best what He means by these letters."
  31,2,"Those namely these signs are the signs of the wise Book the Qur’ān the one containing wisdom the genitive annexation āyātu’l-kitābi’l-hakīm has the partitive meaning of min ‘from’;"
  31,3,"it is a guidance and a mercy read nominative rahmatun; the popular accusative reading rahmatan would make it a circumstantial qualifier referring to āyāt ‘signs’ the operator of which being the implicit demonstrative import of tilka ‘those’ for the virtuous"
  31,4,"who maintain the prayer alladhīna yuqīmūna’l-salāta an explication of al-muhsinīna ‘the virtuous’ and pay the alms and who are certain of the Hereafter the repetition of hum ‘they’ here translated ‘who’ is for emphasis."
  31,5,"Such follow guidance from their Lord and it is they who are the successful the winners."
  31,6,"And among people there is he who purchases idle talk in other words that part of it which diverts people from its true significance that he may lead people astray read li-yadilla; or li-yudilla from the way of God the religion of Islam without knowledge and take it read subjunctive wa-yattakhidhahā as a supplement to yudilla ‘that he may lead astray’; or indicative wa-yattakhidhuhā as a supplement to yashtarī ‘who buys’ in mockery as something to be mocked. For such there will be a humiliating chastisement one of abasement."
  31,7,"And when Our signs in other words in the Qur’ān are recited to such a one he turns away disdainfully as though he never heard them as though there were a deafness in his ears both comparisons constitute two circumstantial qualifiers referring to the subject of the verb wallā ‘turns away’; or it is that the second comparison is an explication of the first. So give him tidings of inform him of a painful chastisement. The use of the expression ‘good tidings’ meant derisively against such a person — this was al-Nadr b. al-Hārith. He used to visit al-Hīra for commerce and purchase books containing the stories of the non-Arab peoples and then recount these to the people of Mecca. He would say ‘Muhammad recounts to you the stories of ‘Ād and Thamūd whereas I relate to you the stories of the Persians and the Byzantines!’ They would thus go to enjoy his stories and neglect to listen to the Qur’ān."
  31,8,"Surely those who believe and perform righteous deeds for them there shall be Gardens of Bliss"
  31,9,"abiding therein khālidīna fīhā is a circumstantial qualification of a future status in other words their abiding therein will have been ordained once they enter it — a promise of God in truth that is to say God promised them this and realised it in truth; and He is the Mighty Whom nothing can overwhelm and so prevent Him from fulfilling His promise and His threat of chastisement the Wise the One Who assigns all things to their rightful places."
  31,10,"He created the heavens without any pillars that you can see ‘amad is the plural of ‘imād which is an ustuwāna ‘a column’ — this is the truth since there are no actual pillars — and cast high mountains into the earth lest it shake with you and He dispersed therein all kinds beasts. And We sent down there is a shift from the third to the second person water from the heaven and We caused to grow in it of every splendid kind every fair specimen."
  31,11,"This is God’s creation in other words what is created by Him. Now show me inform me O people of Mecca what those you worship besides Him those other than Him have created namely your gods so that you have associated them with Him exalted be He mā is an interrogative of denial and a subject; dhā has the significance of alladhī and what follows it of the relative clause is the predicate of the subject mā; arūnī glosses ‘the action’ and what follows it stands in place of two direct objects. Nay bal is for transition but the evildoers are in manifest error error that is evident because of their ascribing partners to God and you are like them."
