tafsir[13]{c,v,t}:
  42,32,"And of His signs are the ships that run on the sea appearing like landmarks like mountains in terms of their magnitude."
  42,33,"If He will He stills the wind whereat they remain they become motionless fixed not moving on its surface. Surely in that there are signs for every steadfast grateful servant — this is the believer who is steadfast during hardship and grateful in times of comfort."
  42,34,"Or He wrecks them yūbiqhunna a supplement to yuskin ‘He stills’ that is to say or He sinks them including their passengers by sending violent winds upon them because of what they that is the passengers of these ships have earned of sins. And He pardons much of such sin and does not cause those who have sinned to drown."
  42,35,"And that those who dispute concerning Our signs may know read indicative wa-ya‘lamu ‘and they know’ beginning a new sentence; or subjunctive wa-ya‘lama ‘and that they may know’ as a supplement to an implicit reason in other words ‘He drowns them in order to exact vengeance against them and so that they may know that …’ they have no refuge no escape from the chastisement the negation represents two direct objects of the verb ya‘lamu or ya‘lama ‘they know’; the negation is also a comment on the implied action of ‘escaping’."
  42,36,"So whatever you — this is an address is to believers and others — have been given of the luxuries of this world is but the enjoyment of the life of this world enjoyed for the duration of it but then perishes. But what is with God of reward is better and more lasting for those who believe and put their trust in their Lord li’lladhīna āmanū wa-‘alā rabbihim yatawakkalūna is supplemented by the following clause"
  42,37,"and those who avoid grave sins and indecencies those acts that require the implementing of the prescribed legal punishments hudūd the supplement above is an example of supplementing the part to the whole and who when they are angry forgive they let it pass;"
  42,38,"and those who answer their Lord those who respond to what He has summoned them in the way of affirming His Oneness and worship of Him and observe prayer maintaining it regularly and whose courses of action those courses of action that seem good to them are a matter of counsel between them in which they consult one another and do not act hastily and who of what We have bestowed on them expend in obedience to God — such mentioned individuals constitute one category;"
  42,39,"and those who when they suffer aggression injustice defend themselves — these are another category — that is to say they retaliate against those who wrong them in the same manner in which the latter wronged them as God exalted be He says"
  42,40,"For the requital of an evil deed is an evil deed like it the latter is also referred to as ‘an evil deed’ because in outward form it resembles the former; this is evident in what concerns retaliation for wounds. Some scholars say that even if another were to say ‘May God disgrace you!’ then one should respond equally with ‘May God disgrace you!’. But whoever pardons his wrongdoer and reconciles the amity between himself and the one pardoned his reward will be with God that is to say God will give him his reward without doubt. Truly He does not like wrongdoers that is those who initiate acts of wrongdoing and so merit His punishment."
  42,41,"And whoever defends himself after he has been wronged that is to say after the wrongdoer has wronged him — for such there will be no course of action against them no blame on them."
  42,42,"A course of action is only open against those who wrong people and seek to commit who commit in the earth what is not right what are acts of disobedience. For such there will be a painful chastisement."
  42,43,"But verily he who is patient and defend himself by retaliating and forgives excuses the wrong done to him — surely that patience and excusing is true constancy in such affairs that is to say it is one of those courses of action for which one must have firm resolve meaning those which are required of the believer by God’s Law."
  42,44,"And whomever God leads astray has no protector after Him that is to say none to take charge of guiding him after God has led him astray. And you will see the wrongdoers when they sight the chastisement saying ‘Is there any way any route by which to return?’ to this world."
