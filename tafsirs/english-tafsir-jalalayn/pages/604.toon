tafsir[15]{c,v,t}:
  112,1,"Say ‘He is God One Allāhu is the predicate of huwa ‘He is’ and ahadun is its substitution or a second predicate."
  112,2,"God the Self-Sufficient Besought of all Allāhu’l-samad constitute a subject and a predicate al-samad means the One Who is always sought at times of need"
  112,3,"He neither begot for no likeness of Him can exist nor was begotten since createdness is precluded in His case."
  112,4,"Nor is there anyone equal to Him’ neither match nor comparison lahu ‘to Him’ is semantically connected to kufuwan ‘equal’ but precedes it because it is the object of the intended negation; ahadun ‘anyone’ which is the subject of yakun ‘is there’ has been placed after the predicate of the latter kufuwan ‘equal’ in order to retain the harmony of the end-rhyme of the verses."
  113,1,"Say ‘I seek refuge in the Lord of the Daybreak the morning"
  113,2,"from the evil of what He has created of obligated animate beings and non-obligated ones and from all inanimates such as poison and so on;"
  113,3,"and from the evil of darkness when it gathers that is from night when it becomes dark and the moon when it is absent"
  113,4,"and from the evil of the women-blowers sorceresses who blow on knots which they knot into strings blowing into them certain words but without spittle; however al-Zamakhsharī says ‘with this spittle’ — sorceresses such as the daughters of the said Labīd —"
  113,5,"and from the evil of an envier when he envies’ when he manifests his envy and behaves in accordance with it — such as the mentioned Labīd from among the Jews who were envious of the Prophet s; the mention of these three elements of evil which are already subsumed by the statement ‘of what He has created’ is because of the severity of their evil."
  114,1,"Say ‘I seek refuge in the Lord of mankind their Creator and their Possessor they mankind have been singled out for mention here in order to honour them and a preface to seeking refuge from the evil of the one who whispers in their hearts;"
  114,2,"the King of mankind"
  114,3,"the God of mankind both maliki’l-nās and ilāhi’l-nās are either substitutions or adjectival qualifications or explicative supplements; the repetition of the annexed word al-nās is meant as an additional explication"
  114,4,"from the evil of the slinking whisperer Satan — he is referred to by the name of the action waswasa on account of his repeated engaging in it — who slinks away and recoils from the heart whenever God is mentioned"
  114,5,"who whispers in the breasts of mankind in their hearts — whenever they neglect to remember God"
  114,6,"of the jinn and mankind’ mina’l-jinnati wa’l-nāsi an explication for the whispering Satan being of the jinn and also of the humans similar to God’s saying the devils of humans and jinn Q. 6112; or mina’l-jinnati ‘of the jinn’ is an explication for him Satan wa’l-nāsi ‘and of mankind’ being a supplement to al-waswās ‘the whisperer’. Both explanations apply to the evil of the mentioned Labīd and his daughters; the objection to the first opinion is that humans do not ‘whisper’ in the hearts of other humans but that it is the jinn who whisper in their hearts I would respond by saying that human beings also ‘whisper’ in a manner appropriate to them beginning externally whereafter their whispers reach the heart and establish themselves in it in the way in which this customarily happens. But God knows best what is correct and to Him shall be the return and the final destination and may God bless our Master Muhammad and his family and Companions and grant them all much peace forever and always. God suffices for us and what an excellent guardian is He! And there is no power or might except in God the Sublime the Tremendous."
